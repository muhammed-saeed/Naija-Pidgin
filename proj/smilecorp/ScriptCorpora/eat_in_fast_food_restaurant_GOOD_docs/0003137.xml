 ★★★★☆ Best Lemon Chicken 
 veronica m. | Insider Guru
| Rank: 698 4 Sun-Ly Chinese Restaurant 
 
Sun Ly has some of the best Fried Rice, Chow Mein, and Lemon Chicken. Everything is made to order, and the Lemon Chicken is actually crunchy, not doughy or soft. They will prepare it and place the sauce in a small container, this way if you are taking it to go your food won&apos;t get soggy. I would also recommend the General&apos;s Chicken,&amp;Beef with Broccoli. They do family meals also.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Discusting 
 Syn M. 1 Sun-Ly Chinese Restaurant 
 
I just went to Sun-Ly for lunch and ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp. When I opened the box I noticed Bugs on the lettuce. I was so nasty. I will never go back.

 ★★★★☆ Nice Chinese take out place - they make the food after you order it. 
 Perez M. | Insider Expert
| Rank: 5,006 4 Sun-Ly Chinese Restaurant 
 
This is a small chinese fast food place in the plaza at the conner of Tully Rd and Mclaughlin Ave. Most of the time, the guest order to go, as they only has 2 small table, and they has limited selection of soda. While the place look so small + kind of old, their food is good. Price range = $5 -&gt;$8 per order. Also, they cook your food after you order it, so you can be sure that the food is fresh.

 ★★★★☆ wontons 
 Les T. | Insider Expert
| Rank: 9,822 4 Sun-Ly Chinese Restaurant 
 
There is a very unusal appetizer here that you just have to try. You know cream cheese and wontons? They taste fabulous together and fried! Trust me, even though it sounds strange, it is really delicious. Sometimes this restaurant gives out free samples with coupon. The other dishes are your typical fast food chinese fare.

 ★★★★★ Greatest Chinese Food Ever 
 Eugene L. | Insider
| Rank: 23,603 5 Sun-Ly Chinese Restaurant 
 
Sun Ly is a small fast food restaurant but it is the greatest. They make the best chow mein and fried rice. There are many things to order on the Sun Ly menu, and all of them is very delicious.

Its a little hide-a-way place that takes pride in the food they prepare and its done to order not sitting in a pan somewhere so you get it fresh..A great value for the Buck.

Pros: Cooked to order, friendly service, Pretty Asain Girls

Cons: Limited Parking, Small eating area
