 UPDATE on free lunch location! Read below. 

Hungry for vegan delights?

The Food Network and Costa Mesa vegan food truck Seabirds are offering a free lunch to the first 100 visitors on Saturday—somewhere in Orange County. From now until the weekend, lunchtime warriors should be on the lookout for location clues posted here and on Twitter @FoodNetwork .

The first clue is: This market caters to“greenies.”

 UPDATE: OK, the location of the free lunch is at the OC Green Market on the campus of Irvine Valley College . The address is 5500 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, 92618. Get there as soon as possible, since only the first 100 people in line will receive a free lunch on the Food Network. After 100, you’re on your own—which probably means paying.

 I’ll be gone for this free Chick-fil-A breakfast deal .

Here’s how it works:
 
“From September 6 – 10, 2011, participating Chick-fil-A restaurants are giving away a variety of free breakfast entrées to customers who make a reservation online.”
 
There are nine breakfast items to choose from when you make your reservation HERE .  You also have to pick a specific time slot to get your free meal. (Ex. 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m.  or 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.)

Availability in Orange County appears to be pretty good. There are plenty of reservations left at stores in Orange, Foothill Ranch, Irvine and Brea. La Habra and Tustin locations are likely to run out soon, according to the website.
