Analytical Reports: So You Have to Do a Survey! Design the Questions to Get the Answers You Need

 By Neil Sawers 
 
This is the fifth in a series of articles on conducting a survey. The premise is that you have been assigned an analytical report and as part of the report you have to survey the target audience.

The first thing to bear in mind is the fundamental question &quot;Who is this audience?&quot; What is their education level? The higher the level, the more complex the questions can be. The language you use can be adjusted accordingly. You&apos;re not going to ask senior managers in a major organization the same questions as you might to cashiers at a fast food restaurant. If you did, you&apos;d probably run into problems of comprehension and get conflicting answers.

With a basic survey, most experts suggest using language at a Grade 5 level. Again the K.I.S.S. principle applies. Keep the words simple, the language simple, the questions simple. You want the questions easily understood, with nothing ambiguous about them. Here&apos;s a tip: Avoid using jargon or colloquialisms. Something could be misinterpreted. Most of us have seen questions where we wondered who had come up with the wording because it could be taken more than one way.

Clearly you need to construct the questions to get at the answers you need. If you want specific answers then you are more likely to go to close-ended questions. For example, if you asked the question &quot;How would you rate the condition of the community swimming pool?&quot; you could then provide a choice between Excellent/Reasonable/Needs Improving. The target audience would be asked to circle the word that they felt applied. That&apos;s a close-ended question and answer. These answers lend themselves to easy computer coding so results can be obtained quickly.

An open-ended question is one designed to open up the conversation. For example, if you asked the target audience why they feel that the condition of the community swimming pool needs improving, the conversation is opened up. With an open-ended question the objective is to prevent the person from giving one-word answers. You want a broad viewpoint, which is why open-ended questions allow different points of view to surface. For example, if your analytical report is to help management decide the direction for the company over the next decade, you want as many views as possible. The questions you pose will be open-ended to get the desired type of response.

It all comes back to the purpose of the report. What information do you need? What kind of survey questions will help you get it? If it&apos;s a multiple response type question, such as circling a preferred soft drink out of three brand names, that&apos;s a close-ended question. For broader information, and almost certainly the kind you&apos;ll need for most corporate analytical reports, the open-ended question will focus you in the right direction. Just bear in mind the target audience, their educational level, their age, their community and any other factor that might determine the language you use and how you phrase the questions.
