Harassed by my boss....IL
 Tags: bossil , company , employment , finally , harassed , labor , law , manager , owner , sexually Today I finally came forward and told my HR manager that I have been sexually harassed by the owner of our company for about 3 years. It was the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever had to do, and I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s only just begun. I had planned on going in today and letting her know what has been going on and informing her that I&apos;d be looking for a new job. I was going to continue working there untill I either A) found a new job or B) was too uncomfortable with the situation. She recommended that I leave, saying that she didn&apos;t want me to have to feel uncomfortable. She also told me that the other owner probably would not want me to return to work because she also&quot;wouldn&apos;t want me to have to work with him&quot;after this. I asked her if that meant I&apos;d be fired. She said,&quot;not fired. We&apos;d just understand if you didn&apos;t want to return to work.&quot;I told her I wasn&apos;t prepared to quit the job as of yet, but that I would leave for the day to avoid the discomfort. I collected my things and went home. Later in the day my HR manager and the other owner of the company met with me outside of the office. They told me to take the rest of the week off, and let me know that&quot;We&apos;re going to take care of Frank. This can&apos;t happen again. He needs help.&quot;(This is not the first time they have had an issue with this man and sexual harassment. But I don&apos;t believe that there has ever been any sort of court case. I believe they paid a girl off to keep quiet. Though I&apos;m not sure of this). I really don&apos;t know where to go from here. I&apos;m pretty sure I should get in touch with a lawyer. I don&apos;t know how to go about leaving my job. I don&apos;t want to have to quit because that is completely unfair, but I DO NOT feel safe or comfortable going back to work for him. Do I have to get in touch with the EEOC, or do I wait to hear back from my HR manager at the end of the week, to see what actions (If any) they have taken???? I&apos;m just looking for a bit of guidance. Thank you so much. 3 Comments under it.

 Post a Comment Now. Comments Wed, 30 Mar 2005 09:22:00 GMT (1) Again, this guy is very sleezy. Of course, you will want to take the advice of your cousin. However, ask him/her about the advisability of filing a complaint with the EEOC before settling. The reason is that if the EEOC hears about a person such as this owner, they may decide to pursue it on their own, even if you settle on the matter.

I believe that is what happened in a large lawsuit that the EEOC pursued against Mitsubishi. Again, your cousin will give you the best advice. Tue, 29 Mar 2005 11:46:00 GMT (2) This situation is just horrible. Since you are in Illinois, you should contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights. Their website is at: http://www.state.il.us/dhr/

It is not necessary to hire an attorney for help at this stage. However, you may want to contact a plaintiff&apos;s attorney specializing in labor law for an initial consultation. (Attorneys don&apos;t usually charge for an initial conversation.)

What your employer has implied is illegal - that you should quit. However, if the company is small (less than 15 employees), it won&apos;t be covered by federal anti-discrimination laws.

The other thing that you should do is to send the HR person a letter, stating that you are asking for her/his help because of the sexual harassment. Send it in a way that will show proof that it was received, such as sending a fax or sending it certified mail, return receipt required. Keep copies of that proof. Wed, 30 Mar 2005 08:51:00 GMT (3) Since the last time I posted, I was again asked to meet with the female owner of the company. She wanted to offer me counseling at the companies expense. She also informed me that I am the 4th person who has been harassed by this man. One being her own daughter, another being my human resource/office manager. Unbelievable. She told me that she is hiring an attorney, to get rid of him. She stressed how much she wants Him to pay for what he did. She said she wants him to pay me out of his pocket, and that she hopes I will settle out of court. I&apos;ve spoken with a lawyer (who happens to be my cousin) who let me know that these cases are extremely draining, and long and if they are offering me to settle out of court, it may be the best idea. I am going to his firm on Monday to further discuss the matter. I&apos;m also under the impression right now that nothing will really be done to this man to keep him from comitting this crime again. I was hoping by going through a trial, he&apos;d be punished, not just ordered to pay me money. I am not sure that I understood that correctly, and I intend on finding out more info on Monday. For now I&apos;m going to lay low, and try to have little communication with the company untill I know more information. Thanks for your help. Post a Comment Now.
