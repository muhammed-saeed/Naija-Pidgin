 October 23, 2007 Fry Sauce (French Fry Sauce; French Fries Sauce) 
Fry sauce (sauce for french fries ) is a popular state dish or Utah, but is now served in Oregon and other Western states. A simple recipe is one part ketchup and two parts mayonnaise.

The Arctic Circle fast food restaurant chain is said to have invented fry sauce in 1948 (according to Wikipedia). In the 1940s, the first“Arctic Circle”restaurant in Salt Lake City was called the“Don Carlos Bar-Be-Q,”after founder Don Carlos Edwards. The Arctic Circle restaurant trademarked fry sauce (&quot;a dipping sauce for french fries&quot;) from April 1956.

A September 4, 2007 post (below) claims that Stan’s Diner in Provo, UT first invented fry sauce, and that the Arctic Circle borrowed the recipe.


 Wikipedia: Fry Sauce 
 Fry sauce is a regional condiment served with french fries. It is usually a simple combination of one part ketchup and two parts mayonnaise. When spices and other flavorings are added, it is similar to—but thicker and smoother than—traditional Russian dressing and Thousand Island dressing. Fry sauce is commonly found in restaurants in Utah, much of Idaho, eastern Washington and rural Oregon, but is also commonly found in supermarkets across the country, as well as available by mail-order. Occasionally other ingredients such as barbecue sauce are substituted for ketchup.

The Utah-based Arctic Circle restaurant chain claims to have invented fry sauce around 1948. Arctic Circle serves it in its restaurants in the western United States. Many other fast-food restaurants and family restaurants in the region, such as Carl’s Jr, Crown Burgers, Apollo Burger and Hires Big H, offer their own versions of the sauce.

Until 1999, Utah franchise locations of McDonald’s also carried fry sauce. The chain stopped stocking the condiment because of the high waste it produced: because of its mayonnaise content, the sauce spoils after a single day if left unrefrigerated. Nevertheless, many other national fast food restaurants in Utah and nearby states serve fry sauce.

Among the most popular souvenir pins during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City were ones that depicted fry sauce. Originally sold for US$7.50, these pins became valued at over $60 before the Olympic games started.

 Arctic Circle 
 History 
Back in 1924, an inventive and entrepreneurial young man named Don Carlos Edwards put up a tiny refreshment stand during a Pioneer Day celebration in a small Northern Utah town. Although he didn’t know it then, that stand was the beginning of a fast food icon that now spans the Western United States.

By 1941, Edwards’little stand in a small rural town had evolved into Don Carlos Bar-B-Q in Salt Lake City. Nine years later, he opened his second restaurant in Salt Lake, which he called Arctic Circle.

This new restaurant featured numerous original family recipes that were as tasty as they were unique. Soon after the opening in 1950, long lines of people were waiting for their chance to taste standout menu items like“Brown Toppers”and“Ranch Burgers.”

In those early years, Edwards continued to invent new foods and options. Fry sauce and kid’s meals, for example, are Arctic Circle originals. 

 Arctic Circle 
 Original Fry Sauce 
Arctic Circle has long been an innovator in fast foods, but our Original Fry Sauce—a tasty, tangy mixture of tomato concentrate, lemon juice, eggs, and a whole bunch of other ingredients—stands out as the most imitated, and also the least duplicated. Ever since we invented fry sauce more than 50 years ago, we’ve carefully guarded the original secret recipe. There is only one original fry sauce and Arctic Circle has it.

But nowadays, many people are dipping their fries (and lots of other foods, for that matter) into Arctic Circle Original Fry Sauce outside our restaurants. Not because one of our competitors has cracked our secret recipe, but because we now have 12-ounce bottles available for purchase in our stores. And that means you can take the Original home with you!

So if you’re hankering for some doggoned delicious dipping, visit your nearest Arctic Circle and take home the only fry sauce that’s been featured on national television, Olympic pins, and more. Original Fry Sauce, exclusive to Arctic Circle—where the good stuff is!

 The basic recipe 
1 part ketchup
2 parts mayonnaise
Mix together until thoroughly blended.

 Other options: 
Substitute barbecue sauce for ketchup.
Use buttermilk or half&amp;half to thin the sauce.
Pickle juice (either dill or sweet) for a little zing (rumor has it the official recipe includes pickle juice)
Chopped pickles minced very tiny, so the sauce is a little chunky (this makes the sauce look suspiciously like thousand island dressing)
Seasoning salt
Horseradish
Garlic
Whatever exotic spices you have on your shelf—go ahead, experiment

 The Origins of Fry Sauce 

My friend Barry (originally from Detroit) asked me what is unique about Utah and what he should do to experience the state to its fullest. The first thought that came to mind was that he should try fry sauce, a combination of ketchup, mayonaisse and sometimes additional ingredients used as a dipping sauce for french fries.

See if you can follow this. Last week I met Laurel’s maternal grandmother’s former husband’s oldest son, Ron Taylor. (Laurel’s grandmother passed away a few years ago.) He claims (and I believe him) to have invented fry sauce. How cool is that!? His father is Stan, who used to own Stan’s Diner on 900 East in Provo, Utah. He said it came about as a natural evolution of combining ketchup and mayonaisse as a burger condiment, and it just grew in popularity. He said someone from Arctic Circle (a Utah-based burger chain) later asked his permission to use the recipe. Arctic Circle and other chains have popularized it across the intermountain west.

Apparently controversy surrounds this topic. Arctic Circle (the former management long gone) now claims to have invented fry sauce on their Web site. It’s hard to know who is the true originator. Maybe they both can claim it. I believe Ron first introduced the basic combination of ketchup and mayo and that Arctic Circle later perfected it by adding additional ingredients (which they say are part of a secret recipe).

The articles listed at the bottom of this post mention some interesting tidbits. For example, the Deseret News article claims more fry sauce is now consumed in Oregon than in Utah. (So maybe Barry, who now lives near Portland, won’t have to travel so far to get his fill.)

If you have any additional insight, please post a comment here and let us know. I think we should spread the word and honor Ron for this invention that changed the world for the better.

How is it that no one can read the top of the lid that you get your fry sauce in at Arctic Circle...IT PLAINLY STATES SOUR CREAM, using mayo or miracle whip is just being ghetto about it. Its called literact and if you can be insulted here maybe you will read the lid, eh?

Hi Barry,

I saw that you had referenced my earlier post about fry sauce. Apparently, Stan’s Diner was an Arctic Circle before it was Stan’s Diner. So if my facts are straight, it was Ron Taylor working for an Arctic Circle that invented it.
