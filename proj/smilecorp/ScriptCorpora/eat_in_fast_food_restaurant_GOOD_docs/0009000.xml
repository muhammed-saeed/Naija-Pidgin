Is automatic up charging without notice at fast food restaurants legal?

Is is legal for a fast food restaurant to up charge a value meal without your permission? Examle, I ask for a number 4 combo meal at the drive through, I see the advertised price on the sign. they give me a total and I pay and take my food and drive away, as I drive I realize the total seemed a little hi so i check my reciept and notice I was up charged.I was charged extra for a larger drink and extra for a larger fry. I was not offerd this nor did I ask for this by the person taking my order and the different options were not listed on the drive through sign. I have gone back several times to see if this was an accident but it happens everytime I have gone to this particular restaurant. Is it legal for them to do this?I would say they are scaming the public as most people will not notice and if confronted they can just say it was a simple mistake.

Thank you for your time and help.
