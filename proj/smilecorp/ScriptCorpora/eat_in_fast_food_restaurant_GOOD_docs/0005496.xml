 Never Say No To La Novia (1,908 thumbs up) FOR SALE: 
 The YAM Network (Auction ends Thursday, July 12, 2012!) 
 Adventures In The Third Dimension, Part 2 
 Self Storage | Massachusetts, USA | Math&amp;Science 
 Customer: “Hi, I called earlier about getting a storage unit.”

 Me: “Okay. What size were you looking for?”

 Customer: “I don’t know. You told me on the phone.”

 Me: “Hmm, well, there are 4-5 people in this office who answer the phone at any time. I don’t think I spoke to you.”

 Customer: “Oh. Well, it was…hmm. I don’t remember.”

 (I walk her outside the office into the parking lot show her a painted grid on the ground that illustrates the different sizes. I take a long time explaining the different sizes, and how much each costs. She has a price/size list in her hand the whole time. She looks very confused but finally seems to understand and decides she wants a 10’x10’ storage unit. We go back in the office so we can do the paperwork.) 

 Customer: “Okay, so, 10’x10’ is the width?”

 Me: “Well, 10’x10’ means the space is ten feet wide and ten feet long.”

 Customer: *blank stare* 

 Me: “The grid you just looked at painted on the ground shows only the footprint of the storage unit.”

 Customer: *blank stare* 

 Me: “The illustration grid painted on the ground does not show the third dimension, which is height. The ceiling is about 8 feet high.”

 Customer: *blank stare* “So…I can stack things UP?” *she looks excited* 

 Me: “Yes. You are not renting a two-dimensional space.”

 Customer: *blank stare* 

 Me: “You are not renting a parking space. You are going to be renting a three-dimensional storage space.”

 (I gesture with my hands to make the shape of a three dimensional box.) 

 Customer: “This is so confusing!”

picks up a book, opens it, and immediately drops it back on the shelf.)
