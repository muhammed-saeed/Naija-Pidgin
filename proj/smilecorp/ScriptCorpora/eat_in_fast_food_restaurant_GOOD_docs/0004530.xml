Halstead: My fears over traveller site plans

 Halstead: My fears over traveller site plans 
A holiday park owner fears for the future of his business as decisions loom on traveller site plans.

Matt Thorn&apos;s land abutts the traveller site in Vernons Road, Chappel, which has been occupied on and off since 2009 without planning permission.

Plans have been submitted for a change of use of land for three pitches, utility sheds and boundary fences at Orchard Place is pending consideration.

Mr Thorn, 38, of Greenacres Farm, has recently installed four CCTV cameras and has moved his holiday park plots closer to his home,away from the traveller site.
 
He said: “It’s certainly changed the environment here.

“Before, I didn’t even used to lock my door.&quot;

However, agent David Cookson, working on behalf of the applicant Christopher O’Driscoll, highlights an “acute shortage of gypsy sites nationally and locally, which should be remedied as soon as
 possible”.
