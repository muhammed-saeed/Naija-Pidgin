You can enjoy an order of French fries at Sonic for under 200 calories.
 Image:©[2010]Clipart.com Sonic Drive-In is best known for burgers, fries, ice cream treats, and a particularly diet-decimating dish, the Frito pie. But fortunately, if you can avoid being tempted by the sundaes and high-fat ice cream-based beverages, you can actually find a few treats for a reasonable amount of calories, such as an order of fries or a small dish of ice cream for less than 200 calories. Here is a look at some calorie-smart choices at Sonic Drive-In .

Good Choices:

 Junior burger - 355 calories Grilled cheese toaster - 310 calories Grilled chicken sandwich - 350 calories Grilled chicken salad (no dressing) - 365 calories Chicken strip snack - 280 calories French fries, regular - 185 calories Vanilla dish - 195 calories 

Choices to Avoid:

 Super Sonic #1 - 885 calories The Little Cheese - 840 calories Chicken club toaster - 715 calories Country fried steak - 745 calories Extra-long cheese Coney - 660 calories Fritos chili pie - 610 calories Chili cheese Tater Tots - 530 calories Banana split - 425 calories Coca-Cola float - 425 calories
