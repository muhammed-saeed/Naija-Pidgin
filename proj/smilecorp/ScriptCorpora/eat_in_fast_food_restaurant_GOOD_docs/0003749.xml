 Delaware Hitchhiking Story: Once hitched a ride from downtown Newark to Pittsburgh with a buddy. First leg got us to the PA Turnpike at the Denver exit, then we got a ride from there all the way to where we were going. On the way, a tire blew in the middle of a tunnel, a very scary experience while we changed the wheel in there with the opposing traffic barely missing us. It was May 15, 1953. That night, at a bar in Pittsburgh, we went to see a heavyweight fight on TV with some other guys. It was Marciano vs. Walcott. I got up from the table just as the fight started, to get a pitcher of beer. When I got back to the table with the beer, the fight was over. Rocky had KO&apos;d Jersey Joe within a minute of the first round.
You could look it up.

 I too went to the Grady&amp;Hurst Show,but only one time.
We went straight from school. We took a change of clothes,because being on a dance show in our St. Elizabeth uniform,was a No,No. We would have been in trouble deep,as the old Eberly Brother&apos;s song goes.

You are right about the long bus ride. That is why we never went back.
It was raining when we came out,instead of waiting in the rain for the next bus,we thummed a ride,bad idea. Two older guys gave us a ride. We were lucky,nothing happened to us,but it was scary enough that we never tried that again and never went back.

Pike Creek, De USA - Friday, March 30, 2007 at 20:40:36 (EST) Tony Undorf taught me how to ChaCha to the Diamond&apos;s song &quot;Little Darlin&quot;. We lived around the corner from each other at 27th&amp;West. A group of us would get the bus to the Grady&amp;Hurst show at the corner of Concord Av.&amp;Washington Sts. Jerry Hare and his sister Betty were regulars for a while. we Others that I can remember that went to Wilm. High were Cookie Covelli, Anne Bartholmew, Bubbles Alpern, Mary Ann Sevinski, Bertha Nichols. Joe Nedwick went from St. Eliz. Bob Clayton was also there until he started to go to Bandstand in Phila. All of these kids went on &quot;the show&quot; in 1955 - 1956. The bus ride seemed to take forever and we thought we were way out in the country by the time we got there. Lots of good memories.

Bear, De USA - Friday, March 30, 2007 at 18:33:06 (EST) I was on the Grady and Hurst show several times. I have searched my memory but cannot remember any of the regulars on the show, if in fact there were any. I don&apos;t think the teens were as dedicated to that show as they were to Bandstand when it was in Philadelphia. I did know quite a few of those regulars as some of them came from our area. Anyone who was never in the studio would have been shocked to see how small the dance area actually was. The camera angles always made it look like it was a large room. My memory tells me it was not much more than a 20 x 20 area to dance in. Of course, we didn&apos;t need a lot of area because we didn&apos;t have arms and legs flailing all over the place. We actually knew who we were dancing with.

New Castle, De USA - Friday, March 30, 2007 at 11:34:27 (EST) Back to the old Camp Arrowhead; I went there for eight weeks each summer from 1948-1953. This was before the Episcopal Diocese took it over. Col.Ralph Sasse, a Wilmington native, West Point graduate and later head football coach there and at Mississippi State, ran the camp which featured such as crafts (think wood shop), archery, boxing, indian lore, folk lore, riflery(sp), any sport involving a ball, horseback riding (Sasse had been in the cavalry), sailing and swimming. We even had a salt water pool with water pumped in from the Rehoboth Bay; never seen such before or since. Sanford Secor, out of East Stoudsburg was the head counselor; we began each day with Reveille and ended with Taps. Stripes were given to campers for &quot;excellence&quot; in various endeavors and were awarded Saturday nights at an &quot;indian council fire.&quot; The stripes were yellow for horsemanship, green for crafts, blue for &quot;aquatics,&quot; red for athletics plus the coveted white &quot;gentleman&apos;s&quot; stripe - the only one you could lose for commission of nefarious deeds. If a camper received all the stripes,he received a &quot;Major &apos;A&apos;&quot; and was thereby eligible for a trip to Ocean Downs Raceway. Some Wilmingtonians I remember at the camp, besides Undorf, included Frank Bunch, Bill&amp;John Walker, Peter Kortman, Tom Keller, Jebby Charamella, Bob Burton, and the Claymont contingent, Ed Lieberman, Virgil&amp;Nick Romito. Each summer the campers erected a totem pole, of which there were several and, for all I know, they may still be there. Excuse the rambling, but I have many fond memories of my summers there.

Mount Pleasant, SC USA - Friday, March 30, 2007 at 08:49:01 (EST) Roy, Ed Hurst made a commercial that was shown in my area just a few months ago and I was surprised to see he was still with us. I recall talking with Grady and Hurst in the parking lot near the old roller coaster in Wildwood. I believe it was 1956, before we were married in 1959, that my wife received a personalised autograph for her kid sister.

Pike Creek, De USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 21:57:21 (EST) I know that Sally Starr (my gal Sal)is still riding high. She does a radio show every Sunday morning on 92.1 FM WVLT out of Vineland N.J. She has a web page: http://www.sallystarr.net/ The radio station has a web page too: http://www.wvlt.com/index1.html. I live in Pike Creek and I pick up the radio station frequency just fine. You&apos;ll also find Jerry Blavet (the Geator with the Heater)on the same station. I would like to know more about Gene London&apos;s where-abouts. He was the best! I know that he moved to New York and became a fashion designer and also a collector of movie wardrobe. At least that is what I have read. I miss the days of the General Store, Debbie Dibbly, Quigly Mansion, confetti boxes and Gene opening the show with this song:
Come right on in to the general store 
We&apos;ve got licorice, gum drops, sour balls, 
Anything that you&apos;re hankering for 
You&apos;ll find in Cartoon Corners General Store

Punta Gorda, FL USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 19:39:10 (EST) As for the Grady and Hurst TV show on Channel 12 ... my cousin, Karen Pollitt, was on that show (how many times I do not know). That was &quot;before my time&quot;!
Channel 12 was located where WDEL/WSTW is located now, by the way.

York, PA USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 15:19:09 (EST) Camp Arrowhead! I went to camp there what seems like a zillion years ago, and it&apos;s still going strong! My son just registered his boys for a session there this summer. Anyone remember Camp Mattahoon out on Limestone Road? (long gone) That was my first camping experience. To a city kid it seemed like the Great North Woods at that time. Look at the area today!

Wilm, DE USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 14:50:28 (EST) Butch,
I remember Ed Hurst had a TV show, kind of like, Ameerican Bandstand that was broadcast from the Steel Pier in Atlantic city in the summer. He always seemed too old for the show that had a group of teenagers dancing to the latest rock hits. I don&apos;t remember Grady.

sugar Land, TX USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 14:25:26 (EST) Does anyone remember the Grady&amp;Hurst show on Channel 12? the only &quot;regular&quot; I can recall on the show was Tony Undorf; I went to Camp Arrowhead with him back in the early 50s. Anyone know names of other &quot;regulars?&quot;

Mount Pleasant, SC USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 14:13:31 (EST) I believe the Bowling Center you are referring to on Marrows Rd. was &quot;Brookside Bowl&quot; When it first opened it was called &quot;Bob Turley Bowl&quot; (named after a baseball player)There was a restaurant attached to it and when you sat in a booth you could look through a glass window and watch them bowl.

Ocala, Fl USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 13:47:30 (EST) Sean,
The Smoke Shop is now a tanning salon!?!? Shows how long I&apos;ve been away from Wilm. I guess the 40 Acres area is becoming the high rent district. From the Wilm. newspaper web site I see that the Logan House is still there.

Sugar Land, TX USA - Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 10:07:14 (EST) My husband and I had been bowling in a league at Fairfax Lanes for several years. We bowled on that Thursday evening and heard the next morning that the lanes had burned to the ground. I have been here in Fla. for 25 years (1981) so it has to have been around 28-30 years ago when the fire took place. Unfortuneteley, that same evening, a gentleman bowler in our league suffered a massave heart attatck and we found out the next morning that he had passed away. That was quite a memorable evening for all of us. 
sharon&lt; shar646@aol.com &gt;
weston, fl USA - Wednesday, March 28, 2007 at 17:00:09 (EST) I also recall that a bowling center near Rt. 4 and Marrows Lane was destroyed by a fire.

Wilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Wednesday, March 28, 2007 at 16:34:08 (EST) Wasn&apos;t the Bowling Center in the Fairfax Shopping Center destroyed by a fire about 10 years ago - maybe more?

Wilmingoton, De USA - Wednesday, March 28, 2007 at 10:39:01 (EST) The Grady&apos;s I remember was at 8th&amp;Orange on the 2nd floor, when you got to the top of the stairs, if you turned left there were 6 Bowling Lanes, if you went straight in there were 8 Lanes, Allen Wolfe, owner of Briteway Cleaners, took it over in the early 60&apos;s, he got rid of the 6 lanes to the left.
Grady went to Fairfax, and opened a Bowling Center in the Fairfax shopping center. 
Bill&lt; wchamerica@aol.com &gt;
Ocala, Fl USA - Tuesday, March 27, 2007 at 16:00:02 (EST) Does anyone out there remember Grady&apos;s, a few doors down from the old Morning News/Journal Every Evening, between eighth and ninth streets? It may have been the first or nearly the first bowling alley in Wilmington. It was on the second-floor and there were about eight or 10 lanes. In those days we picked up a little bit of money by setting pins for the bowlers. When they were done bowling, they would toss some change down the lanes for you. The nationally famous Andy Verapapa, a trick shot artist, stopped in there fairly regularly to give demonstrations. There was also a few pool tables in a room to the side. We weren&apos;t allowed in there in those days. Adults only.

New Castle, De USA - Tuesday, March 27, 2007 at 13:32:56 (EST) I can recall one summer in the late 1930&apos;s collecting those pesky Japanese Beetles. Young kids in the neighborhood spent most of the summer picking the bugs from rose bushes and gardens and dropping them into a glass jar. The jar contained a small amount of coal oil and covered with a lid. The liquid I believe was kerosene or what ever was used in the old &quot;FLIT&quot; spray pumps. There was a rumor, there was a bounty on the critters but never heard anyone collecting. When picking up the beetles they tickled your hand as they tried to escape. The beetles seemed to have a preference for rose bushes and hollyhocks. The Japanese Beetle invasion was most likely something our parents &quot;cooked up&quot; to keep us out of trouble. ....Bob

Cape May, N.J. USA - Tuesday, March 27, 2007 at 09:30:03 (EST) Is the Smoke Shop still located at Del. Ave and DuPont STs?
Across from Trolley Square - used to be a very busy corner.

Sugar Land, TX USA - Tuesday, March 27, 2007 at 07:41:31 (EST) Re the new Applebees. I read somewhere that they will have old pictures of the Chuck Wagon hanging in the resturant, but I don&apos;t think any of the old coffee pot remains. I remember it well. 
Linda&lt; lac1053@comcast.net &gt;
Wilm, DE USA - Tuesday, March 27, 2007 at 01:24:07 (EST) I remember having a wonderful time roller skating at the roller ring on the Govornor Pritz Blvd. I have been trying to remember the owner&apos;s name as he also played the music while we watched all the girls skating around the ring. We had a good time trying to show off for all the girls . I had many a fall trying to learn how skate. It was a good place to have a good time on a cold winter day with your friends .

Hockessin, De USA - Monday, March 26, 2007 at 23:06:25 (EST) Is there still a Flower Market every spring at Rockford Park? 
As a kid I used to look forward to it every year. I&apos;m glad a developer hasn&apos;t found a way to build condos/townhouses on the park land. 
Bruce&lt; bc@houston.rr.com &gt;
Sugar Land, TX USA - Monday, March 26, 2007 at 13:54:00 (EST) One of the people stopped by the Candid Camera crew was named Betty (I don&apos;t want to post her last name). I think most of her response was beeped out. She didn&apos;t fall for the trick like most of the people they showed. 
Swifty&lt; williamwswift@aol.com &gt;
York, PA USA - Monday, March 26, 2007 at 09:24:09 (EST) THE PRANK

On May 21, 1963, Candid Camera and the Delaware Highway Patrol set up a roadblock at the state line, roughly 25 yards from the highpoint, with a sign reading: &quot;Delaware is Closed Today.&quot; Motorists were told that the state was under repair and that they should try again tomorrow. One driver meekly asked, &quot;Is Jersey open?&quot; 

Sorry, this is all I could find online. Perhaps the Historical Society has more...

Wilm, DE USA - Sunday, March 25, 2007 at 15:53:48 (EST) I started school in 1942 at Ursuline Academy in first grade. I did ride the bus the first year, but I do not remember a maroon bus. It could have been maroon, but I don&apos;t think so. Mr. May, who is now deceased would remember, but his daughter Janet could be of help. I spent 12 years there as a student, and another 12 years teaching there. Never do I remember a maroon bus. However I will ask if any of the nuns remember it. I am not contradicting, I am just not sure.

hartly, de USA - Saturday, March 24, 2007 at 19:32:02 (EST) I grew up in the city and don&apos;t recall ever seeing a school bus. When we moved in 1956, I began taking a school bus to Conrad from the Cedars. After all those years of trudging through rain and snow, it was like a miracle. The following year I drove my &apos;48 Plymouth.

Wilm, DE USA - Saturday, March 24, 2007 at 08:39:58 (EST) The only time I can recall riding a school bus was in 1937 at age five. My parents put my brother and I on the bus that took us to school at First and Central Bible School during the summer. The church was located across from the Hotel Du Pont. Through the 40&apos;s I never recall riding on any school bus, never remember seeing any. I do remember the school play area was behind a high wall. The Du Pont building and the Hotel Du Pont was the biggest thing around back then but there is no mention of it on Old Wilmington.

Cape May, N.J. USA - Friday, March 23, 2007 at 15:23:44 (EST) On that Candid Camera Show, I remember Delaware being full rather than closed. Candid Camera set a railroad crossing type swing arm on the southbound side of Ebright Road. They stopped cars from entering Delaware from Pennsylvania and let them in one by one as cars left Delaware.

Sorry. That was inspired by that great video clip on the old &quot;Candid Camera&quot; show, where they set up a roadblock (I believe it was on Ebright Road) and told people driving into Delaware that they&apos;d have to turn around and go back, because Delaware is closed today. A classic Candid Camera stunt.

Sugar Land, TX USA - Monday, March 19, 2007 at 12:10:37 (EST) Harry,
Kelly&apos;s on Gov. Printz was the first fast food restaurant I went to. It&apos;s hard to imagine getting a hamburger for .15! Even if it was thin.

Wilmington, de us - Sunday, March 18, 2007 at 07:59:57 (EST) Norman - re: the Strand and the Edgemoor. Back in the early &apos;50&apos;s, they were e exactly to me as you described them, particularly the windowed smoking lounge at the E&apos;moor. One thing I do remember liking about the Strand was that there was no balcony, but that the floor began to rise in tiers toward the back of the theater so you could get a good view of the screen if you sat &quot;up&quot; there. 
Bob Wilson Jr&lt; wilso127@yahoo.com &gt;
Beaufort, SC USA - Sunday, March 18, 2007 at 07:42:39 (EST) Gene---Good ole Strand theater, I used to serve the circulars for upcoming movies, got a free pass and usually got tossed out, for oneryness by Libby the head usher. Another usher was Bubby Johnson? and her brother took the tickets. Irene Slez sold the tickets and Ben Seligman Owned the theater,or managed it.
Gene, do you remember we used to go to the Edgemoor theater where they had high back lounge chairs in one section and I think you could smoke in there, it was glass enclosed.

New Castle, De USA - Saturday, March 17, 2007 at 12:02:13 (EST) Connie: yes, I remember one of the first Gino&apos;s restaurants that opened on Dupont Hwy. at Wilmington Manor. Their hamburgers were $.15 or seven for a dollar. Fries were $.10. On Fridays I would take a family of 4 after I got paid as a treat and we were well fed for under three dollars. Of course, we weren&apos;t paying much more than a quarter for a gallon of gas either. I know the salaries have gone up along with the prices, but it seems to be more disproportionate now than ever before.

 Does anybody know if the old Coffee pot still exists behind the front facade, and will it be saved somehow, somewhere? Who do you contact? The county?

Wilmington , de USA - Saturday, March 17, 2007 at 05:21:21 (EST) Maureen and Dave, I recall going to the Ritz theater many nights and weekends while in high school. I remember the heat would be shut down as soon as the last feature started and it would get cold as a barn. I too remember dating a very nice girl who lived on Park Place almost directly behind the theater. We spent a lot of time at the movies about 1947 and 1948. ....Bob

and surrounding areas went to the Strand Theater on saturdays. We saw 
 Two movies,assorted shorts,serials(such as tarzan or flash gordon)cartoons,and all for a dime.I was given 16 cents for the afternoon, as mentioned 10 cents for the show, 1 cent for fleers bubble gum and 5 cents for a double dip ice cream after the show.

hartly, de USA - Friday, March 16, 2007 at 17:21:04 (EST) Anyone remember Ritz movie on Delaware ave. between Jackson St. and Adam St.? We would go every Sat. to the matinee for 25 cents. we buy these large lollypops for 5 cents and would last through all the movies, which back then you got to see a cartoon or two and it was a double feature. It was torn down in the early 60&apos;s for I-95, the freeway split our neighborhood in half and many moved out to the suburbs. Our church and school, Sacred Heart, lost so many people, it closed the school in 1969 and the church went down hill, so sad. My family moved out in 1967, it was a really rough time, 1968 riots and so much more happened to the old neighborhood since then. It is coming back slowly, but not to where it was, it was so wonderful growing up there, so many memeories. OK, on a hoodnote, 
Remember St. Pat&apos;s day parade this Sat. March 17, 12 noon.I hope all get a chance to stop down and support the parade. My family has not missed it yet! Rooneys Rest. on Delaware Ave. is having the Irish traditional lunch and McAleeh&apos;s Irish school of dance will there to dance. Happy St Pat&apos;s day to all!

NEW BRAUNFELS, TEXAS USA - Thursday, March 15, 2007 at 13:23:22 (EST) Franny...wow did you bring up some memories of Hercules Hill. We went all the time in the 60&apos;s...You learned real fast that when you walked back up you stayed on the sides. My sister didn&apos;t learn fast enough. We heard the swushing sound of a tobaggan coming, a thump, a yell, and when we looked you just saw the outline of my sister in the snow a few inches padded down. No she wasn&apos;t hurt too bad, she survived, never did find her hat...another time we pancaked and headed down the left thru the trees. Every drop someone slid out from our pile. I was the last one on the sled and had a meeting with a tree. Just a jaw dislocation but what a blast...I would do it all over again in a heartbeat, they were the best of times...Monkey Hill was our other favorite but somehow you always ended up hitting a car or running under it if you didn&apos;t have too much padding...it just wasn&apos;t long enough. Gosh how did my mom survive with the stuff we did, but it was always good clean fun...

Westminster, CA USA - Tuesday, March 13, 2007 at 18:47:20 (EST) To segue from the haircuts&amp;shops, for just a minute, and before we are too quickly whisked away from the beautiful season of winter(my favorite), does anyone remember sledding down the double hill at Prices Run? What a great park I remember in the forties. The double hill was facing E. 23rd St. between Church and Spruce and was located slightly west of the swimming pool. I remember as a child alway knowing that that particular hill was the BIG one. The one for the PRO&apos;s. At age 10, if you could sled off that hill, you had made it. When you came off the top hill, you were suspended in an airborne free fall for a brief few exhilarating seconds before your sled hit the next smaller hill. Just like heaven. The boys loved doing this and were good at it. The girls, more timid. An odd thing, I can&apos;t remember whatever became of my Flexible Flyer.

Whenever my dad took me to the barber and no matter how hard I tried to tell them I still wanted my hair long, it seemed like an unspoken agreement between my dad and the barber that my hair was going to be short!! Just like that. A knowing look and a grunt, that was all the barber needed. As I got older, when I was going to Ernie&apos;s, he cut my hair just the way I liked it. Trouble was, after my dad and grandparents looked at it, back I went until it was cut to their satisfaction. This was until I was 20 years old and went on my own! Although I still have my hair, barbers nowadays are called sylists and when I tell them I want a trim, I have no idea what I&apos;ll end up with.

Regarding Mayor Walz he won by l43 votes against Gene Lammot the first time around and then Gene won the second time he ran. At that time the paper ballot was being used and some question as to the count but couldn&apos;t prove. August Walz then was rewarded as Postmaster for the rest of his life. The Mayor&apos;s term was originally two years and Gene was first for a four year which at the time he was elected he was also a State Senator in Dover which I believe no one else did that. Both jobs were not fulltime and salaries practically non-existent. Not like today.

Sugar Land, TX USA - Tuesday, March 13, 2007 at 10:59:33 (EST) Erik, I do remember the great taste of those long cream filled powdered donuts from Penny Hill. The donuts were always warm when we purchased them as they did not stay in the showcase very long, there was such a demand for them. Back in the early 40&apos;s whipped cream was injected into the donuts when they were purchased. The health department gave them a hard time and said the cream was a dairy product and the donuts should be refrigerated. It was at that point that a non-dairy cream filling was used so the donuts could be sold warm. Actually everyone knew the donuts were consumed within one hour of purchase, they were that good. Bob

Larry Necastro is still cutting hair at his shop on the north side of Lancaster Avenue between Cleveland&amp;Gray Avenues. His wife ran the sandwich shop at the northeast corner of Lancaster&amp;Cleveland for awhile. That used to be Jacks Luncheonette. Anybody who grew up in that neighborhood in the late 50s and early 60s or who went to Wilmington High School after WHS moved to Lancaster Avenue&amp;DuPont Road will remember Jacks Luncheonette. I did not go to WHS but did feed my paper route earnings to the pinball machines in Jacks Luncheonette.

I can remember being at 7th and Madison one day and, as I passed a trash truck (they were still using dump trucks), I heard one of the chuckers givng another hell about how many times he&apos;d told him not to pick up ashes on trash day. That&apos;s when I noticed that the truck was starting to burn. The paint really peeled off of that truck. Didn&apos;t stick around for the fire trucks though.

Wilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Sunday, March 11, 2007 at 16:56:38 (EST) Remembering Ash Day in Wilmington, the ashes were set out curbside along with the &quot;peach Baskets&quot; that contained the cans and bottles. This was just once a week and the receptacles were removed from in front of the property after they were emptied. This was a time for exploring the curbside trash as we kids always walked past on our way to school. There was one occasion I recall one of the kids rescued a broken umbrella from the trash and stripped it of its covering and ribs. Then with the handle and shaft and the imagination only a kid could come up with he proceeded to strut and swagger to school entertaining us. First he would use it as a cane and then as a swagger stick tucked under his arm. He also went through the motions of using as a sword like one of the Three Musketeers. Some of the other kids would stomp on empty milk cans so they would attach to their shoes and make a lot of noise clunking to school. Back then Ash Day was something kids looked forward to. ....Bob

Wilmington, De USA - Sunday, March 11, 2007 at 11:53:29 (EST) the memory trips that are started while staring at this screen - the mention of edgemoor started me remembering the edgemoor theater and it&apos;s saturday specials of cartoons, serials, and a double feature, wirh a big box of popcorn just 25cents. edgemoor iron reminded me of the booming from the rollong mills of worth steel in claymont. Rob McKelvey made me think of just growing up in those times. i hate waiting for or on buses, hate it. i used to take the &quot;arden tincan&quot; from 10th&amp;washington to veal&amp;marsh to get home from school. but if i was slow walking, and i often was, i&apos;d miss it and have to wait an hour for the next one. i&apos;d walk (well, hitch hike really). that&apos;s how i got to know &quot;union jack&quot; (today he would be public enemy #1). it wasn&apos;t recomended, it wasn&apos;t legal, but we still did it. you didn&apos;t have to be affraid going out of your house. the people you met were more likely to smile and say hi, than rob you. the streets and roads were reasonably clean and free of litter. we walked, or rode our bikes everywhere. we all had our chores to do, and we did them. i was going to say or else, but there was no &quot;or else&quot;, you just did them. i think, in a way, our chores were a &quot;rite of passage&quot;. we were eager to be big enough, old enough, to do such-and-such. a different world. and only 50 years ago.

took over. After that I never had a steady Barber, I would get it cut in the Shop least crowded. The first time I went by myself to get a haircut it was 35

Cape May, N.J. USA - Friday, March 09, 2007 at 20:22:04 (EST) The city of Wilmington is looking like one big garbage dump with all the large cobalt blue trash containers in front of all the properties. This is probably the only city in this great country that looks like this. A disgrace to the leaders of Wilmington. I go along with recycle but this has gone too far. A better way could have been devised to handle the situation. It has taken away from the looks of the lovely homes in this city that are not in the slum areas and making them look like slum properties. I feel fortunate that I do not live in the city anymore and that saddens me because I was raised in the city and considered moving back but not now. Such a shame to have that happen and I guarantee you that it will deter others from moving into the city. Wilmington A Place to be Somebody. Hah! A place to have blue garbage barrels for free.
When I drive through the city I just close my eyes and remember it how it was years ago. Lovely tree lined streets, kids playing ball and neighbors chatting to one another about their daily chores. That was a great time in our lives.
Get rid of the garbage barrels and the people who make the city look like a slum
Clean streets and homes are what make a city, not blue garbage barrels.

wilmington, de USA - Friday, March 09, 2007 at 19:03:02 (EST) There was a wonderful lady barber in Wilmington named Josephine Leggio. She had a shop on the west side of Market St. between Concord Ave. and 22nd St. Later she moved to east 22nd St. just east of Market. She did men, women and children. She even came to your home if you were house-bound as was my father. She cut his hair for many, many years. A wonderful lady.

Port St. Lucie, FL USA - Thursday, March 08, 2007 at 19:54:59 (EST) Bruce: I, too, used to &quot;hit&quot; Woolworth&apos;s every Saturday afternoon after the TOP 30 ... both Woolworth&apos;s on Market Street. I headed straight for the 39-cent used 45RPM record bin, bought what I wanted, and then headed to the Dry Goods where the record store owner knew me. He used to hold back the latest 45&apos;s so that I could get first pick. I rarely, if ever, bought less than 10 from him each week, and I would also get my &quot;official&quot; copy of the WAMS TOP 30. I can still picture that Dry Goods record store as if I had been there this morning. What fine memories.

Punta Gorda, FL USA - Thursday, March 08, 2007 at 16:57:23 (EST) Roy,
I did the exact same thing on Saturdays listening to WAMS. It would take hours to do the countdown. I probably should have been studying, but I loved the early rock and roll. As a young kid I remember going to Woolworth&apos;s on Market St. and buying my favorite 45&apos;s - the ones I remember were Ready Teddy by Little Richard and I&apos;m all shock up by Elvis. Wish I knew where they went, probably collector items now. You are right about being simpler times.

Wilm, de USA - Thursday, March 08, 2007 at 13:48:24 (EST) Earliest remembered barber shop was Barber Bill Boyle on the west side of Lincoln just north of Delaware Avenue in the early 50&apos;s. Earliest barber shop out of my own earnings was George Martin on the South side of Lancaster Avenue at Atkins Avenue just across from Foster Park Apartments. Cost me $1.25 in hard earned paper route money. Enjoyed reading the latest copy of &quot;The Polce Gazette&quot; every time I went to George Martin for a haircut.

Wilmington, DE USA - Thursday, March 08, 2007 at 12:49:46 (EST) My local barber in the 9th Ward back in the early &apos;50s was &quot;Al&quot;, who had a shop on the west side of Concord between Washington and West next to a beauty parlor where Ola Whitcomb worked. Ola also worked behind the counter at Sam Lisakoff&apos;s cafe at the corner of Concord and Jefferson. Al gave me my first-ever paid work for making a show card sign for his shop while I was enrolled in a correspondence course in Art (remember those &quot;Draw Me&quot; art instruction matchbook cover ads?)...and Ola was the first person in Wilmington who ever called me &quot;Honey&quot; at first sight, but she was certainly not the last. People in shops back in my old home town up in the Hudson Valley of NY State never did that. I thought that was kind of neat!

Wilmington, de USA - Wednesday, March 07, 2007 at 15:26:39 (EST) When I was a child I remember getting my haircut where my Father and Grandfather had patronized. I don&apos;t recall the price but I remember there were three barbers. Back in those days the barber always thinned my hair with special scissors and applied a heavy jell with the hair brushes to keep the hair neat. This was the late 30&apos;s and early 40&apos;s. The jell actually made the hair hard. There was one treatment I saw performed a few times of men getting their hair singed with a small flame. I never knew what that was supposed to do. The smell of burning hair reminded me of when my Grandmother would hold a fresh turkey over the gas stove to burn off the pin feathers. ....Bob

Cape May, N.J. USA - Wednesday, March 07, 2007 at 11:33:49 (EST) I was born on the Easter Shore of Maryland and haircuts there were 25 cents. This was until 1952 when we moved to Wilmington. I love the Easter Shore but growing up in Wilmington couldn&apos;t be beat.

York, PA USA - Wednesday, March 07, 2007 at 10:12:55 (EST) The earliest haircut I can remember in Wilmington cost me 50¢. Anybody remember any that were cheaper? Who remembers &quot;Blackie&quot; the barber? He had a shop on 30th Street between West and Washington, and later moved out to the Edgemoor Theater building, on the south end of the &quot;mini-strip mall&quot;, on the opposite end from the Edgemoor Drug Store (which had great cherry cokes, by the way.)

Wilm, De USA - Tuesday, March 06, 2007 at 08:00:41 (EST) Just musing .... does anyone remember Roger Holmes&apos; Saturday Morning Top 30 Countdown Show on WAMS back in the 1950&apos;s/1960&apos;s? He had a great very distinctive theme ... &quot;Boogie Blues&quot; from, believe it or not, Bobby Vinton&apos;s first album (when he had a big band) called &quot;Dancin&apos; At The Hop&quot;. A couple of years ago I told Bobby that I had bought that LP back in 1963 ... he was thrilled as it sold VERY few copies!

As a little tyke I used to live for Roger&apos;s show as he played the TOP 30 from Number 30 to Number 1 in reverse order. I used to copy them down as he played them, trying to predict what would be Number 1. Those were simpler times, and I miss them.

Punta Gorda, FL USA - Tuesday, March 06, 2007 at 00:02:22 (EST) About Frank Pingatore ... I went to him for haircuts way back then. I have been told that Frank, or his brother, or whatever ... had something to do with &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; by Bill Haley and the Comets. Speaking of BH&amp;The C&apos;s, I believe their great sax player, the late Rudy Pompelli, used to own the &quot;Drum Shop&quot; in Wilmington, where my ex-next-door-neighbor bought a Mosrite electric guitar (put out by the Ventures) back in the 1960&apos;s. IF he still has it it is worth thousands ... what a sweet guitar it was !

Punta Gorda, FL USA - Monday, March 05, 2007 at 23:57:15 (EST) Ray Jubb - Say or not say what you will about Jack McCool, he may have been the youngest Chief of Police ever in Wilmington. When I heard about that, I was kind of proud that I had been a classmate of his at PS duPont, Class of 1952. 
Bob Wilson&lt; wilso127@yahoo.com &gt;
In Transit, SC USA - Monday, March 05, 2007 at 20:11:16 (EST) Butch, My first barber was also Frank Pingatore Sr (my fathers also) if I remember right he had a shop in the Delaware Trust building at 9th&amp;Market St.
I later went to his son, Frank Jr for my haircuts. He had a shop on 202.
Frank Jr played a great trumpet and he and I were in the band at PS as was Bob Palese on drums, Bob Veazey on clarinet, Elmer Potts Jr on tuba and many others. Great times !

WIlm, De USA - Monday, March 05, 2007 at 14:52:29 (EST) Think &quot;Union&apos;s&quot; car was a black 1950 Chevy two door - maybe a fastback and with all the junk in in it. Wonder if he ever had a run-in with the cops? Remember Yahn&amp;McDonnell cigarettes? I haven&apos;t seen them before or since. they may have been the first cigarettes I smoked save for possibly my folks&apos; Herbert Tareyton cork tips. Who was your barber? When I was real little, it was Frank Pingitore, Sr, my dad&apos;s barber - then it was a guy named George something who was on Silverside Road right around the corner from Hearn&apos;s Market on Phila. Pike. I was in a car wreck at that intersection circa 1958; seems the driver (not me) at the last minute decided he needed to turn left onto Philadelphia Pike and the car, a &apos;57 Ford, hit the light post on the opposite corner. Luckily, all escaped &quot;literally&quot; unharmed. If I&apos;m not mistaken, the Holly Oak telephone exchange operators office, or whatever, was across Silverside Road on what would be the southwest corner with the Pike.

Mount Pleasant, SC USA - Monday, March 05, 2007 at 13:59:59 (EST) I seem to remember the first Pushmobile Derby winner being a boy named Tommy Whelan. Does anyone remember that? Wasn&apos;t the first derby back in the late 40&apos;s and held on Lea Blvd.? 
Pat LeVan&lt; levan1706@bellsouth.net &gt;
Port St. Lucie, FL USA - Monday, March 05, 2007 at 11:42:44 (EST) I can remember back in the early 60s, the Fischer brothers, Len, Billy and Bobby, dominating the Pushmobile derby for their respective age groups. Their pop, William Fischer, Sr., was a Wilmington policeman and a very nice guy.

Newark, DE USA - Monday, March 05, 2007 at 06:11:20 (EST) Joe, I recall I had just made the age cut off, 15yrs. old. The building of the racer gave us young teenagers something to do and look forward to, and occupied our spare time. All the racers received a large plaque in the shape of a shield with a photo of their car and driver as a souvenir of the event. ....Bob

HOCKESSIN, DE USA - Saturday, March 03, 2007 at 17:07:57 (EST) Dave your right, Arty Wilson did live there, I know because whoever was available in the mornings had to go pick him up and take him into the Police Station, and sometimes that was me. Mr. King your also right about Inspector Rich however, it wasn&apos;t Wilson that broke his heart, I think it was John Smith. John went from being a Sgt. one week to a Lt. the next week and then I think He might have even by-passed Capt. when he made Chief, I&apos;m not sure. Couldn&apos;t have been Politics or anything like that, or could it have? I don&apos;t think Rich ever
got over the huge SHAFT. Rich was a good man and a good Policeman, much more deserving than Smith, but thats Politics.

Yes, we were more trusting&amp;trusted to be responsible kids{remembering, of course}, all the admonishments from those who loved us.I recall I was forbidden to ride anyone elses bike, but on a sunny Fall afternoon, my girlfriend&amp;I went to Shallpot Park to explore and &quot;spell&quot;each other our Latin verbs.She let me ride down a hill&amp;my foot slipped off the pedal.It didn&apos;t have much of a tread&amp;dug deeply into the back of my leg. Lots of blood, a deep cut&amp;a ride to the old Del. Hosp. ER with my Dad. &quot;You learned a lesson today&quot; &quot;About trust&quot; &quot;I trusted you to trust me&quot; A good and fair Dad, he was. I baby sat 5 times to reimburse him for that cost. Probably the hardest $30.00 I ever earned. You see, My Dad was a Scot&amp;he took it!

 butch-i think you are thinking of the tunnel between harvey and darley rds. that was for the arden creek i believe. that was a beautiful valley to roam with a long island in the creek. we must have roamed over a home range of close to 20sqmi, mostly on foot. my parents would be arrested today for child abuse, the way they let me roam, and campoout. one summer i campedout almost every week for 3 or 4 days. i had a &quot;cabin&quot; between the b&amp;o;and carr rd, up on the top of the valley. i&apos;d go fishing at the suburban water resivour(sp). when i think of the things that you and i used to do -regularly- and i listen to the people trying to &quot;legislate&quot; safty today, i have to laugh. we were very lucky to growup with the places to roam and the freedom to do it. remember &quot;union jack&quot; and his old cheverlet?
