 Lo-Carb Monster–Energy Drink Review 
 
 
 Monster Lo-Carb Energy–Retail Price: $2.29 per can (16 fl. oz.)
Available Sizes: 16 fl. oz., 24 fl. oz.
 Taste: 8/10
 Price: 7/10
 Energy Level: 7.5/10

 Where To Buy –Monster Lo-Carb Energy is available at most convenience stores nationwide (United States) and is available online.

Get energized with a fraction of the carbs and calories is what this energy drink is about. If you like the original Monster Energy but don’t want to drink it because of the high calories and carbs, you are in luck. The low-carb version of Monster Energy taste just like the regular Monster Energy but with only 10 calories and 3 grams of carb per serving. The most noticeable flavor is sweet-citrus and the yellow energy juice is carbonated for more refreshment. I recommend drinking this energy drink cold so the sweet and sour flavor are less noticeable. In spite of its low calories and carbohydrates, this energy drink packs a good amount of energy. The energy rush from Lo-Carb Monster peaks for about an hour and is noticeable up to 2 hours. If you drink this energy supplement drink on a full stomach, the energy effects may not be as intense. I don’t recommend drinking this energy drink on an empty stomach because you may experience stomachaches and energy breakdowns.

Monster did a great job creating the low-carb version of its original Monster Energy because there is no loss in flavor and its energy is one of the best low-carb energy drinks on the market. If you are health conscious, you may want to stay away from this energy drink because it contains synthetic vitamins and artificial sweetener. Artificial sweetener has been known to have negative effects on the body, especially the brain.

I ran across an article about how well coca cola can clean a lot of things including pennies. It made me wonder if Monster Energy Drink could do the same thing. I ran an experiment and soaked a dirty penny in 2oz of coca cola for 1 hour. 8 out of 10 times coca cola cleaned the dirty penny significantly. I ran the same experiment and soaked a dirty penny in 2 oz of monster for 1 hour. 7 out of 10 times the monster cleaned the dirty penny significantly. My conclusion from this is that monster could be used the same way coca cola is used for many other things besides drinking. i.e clean a toilet, clean a burnt saucepan, use to clean jewelery.

Wow! That is surprising and scary! I agree with you that energy drinks are not healthy. I only drink them once in a long time or when reviewing them for some of my readers.

Maybe you could just use carbonated water and clean your pennies.

I had started taking Monster LoCarb as a way to help me use weight 2 weeks ago. With only 20 calories a can, this interested me. I drank one in the morning on my way to work, and one at each break at work. I ate a hearty meal for dinner, along with a couple snacks during the day…
In December of 07 I had a beautiful little girl. Before I was pregnant, I was never more then 120 soaking wet. After I had her, I weighed 180. I had struggled for the last year or so to loose the weight. For the last 2 months I was halted at 147….
The result of my Monster LoCarb diet????
12 lbs in 14 days GONE. I feel great. No insomnia. People notice that I have lost weight. Not in the areas that flatter you, but in the areas that it is not needed…Stomach, thighs, hips, butt, and more importantly, face. I now weigh 135! This is my demonstration on how this energy drink can not only help give you energy, but help you burn calories, and loose weight!
My snacks generally consisted of Jack Links Jerky, or low calorie popcorn. My meals were medium carb/high protein. I drank maybe a can of regular soda a day (and of course lots of water)….
And WOW! After the first 2 days of being on the energy drink, I averaged 1 lb a day!
I had tried Hydroxycut and Leptovox along with running for 30 minutes a day, and being very physical. With Monster, other then rearranging the energy drink with soda, and low calorie foods, I did not have to wear myself out! And the best part…. If I had a monster with a beef stick, I wouldnt suffer from a growling stomach for hours!
A++ To MONSTER! Thankyou for helping me loose this babyweight that no other products were able to help me loose! I feel great, and if I give it another 2-3 weeks, I will be in the same cloths I was in before I got pregnant!

you are an idiot. a beef stick, coke, and monster is the reason you lost weight. When people read this they will do this horrible diet. I hope people do some research before they copy you on this one. Yes, this Monster is much better with lo carb and low sugar, but to add it to a beef stick is not the direction people who want to lose weight need to go…..

Hate to break it to you, but many brands of beef jerky are surprisingly low in calories, fat, and high in protein. For weight loss, it’s A-Ok. They may contain a lot of salt, but that’s an entirely different problem altogether…

Most thermogenic fat burners also contain a lot of the things in monster. Drinking a Lo Carb Monster isnt bad for you, the energy you get makes youre body work slightly more, which in turn burns more calories. Its not a diet in itself drinking just these but i could see it aiding along side a real diet.
 Reply Jordan says: November 23, 2011 at 8:12 pm 
well the word “idiot” is a bit unnecessary but I do agree, to a certain extent anyway, that this diet is simply an unhealthy choice. True, you may have lost a pound a day, but look at what your putting into your body! I highly doubt that you consumed much more than a pound of food per day and from a healthy point of view, that is not healthy at all. This may work for a brief period of time but eventually your body WILL plateau and will actually begin reacting in a COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE fashion. Your body needs food to burn fat, in other words, the more you eat the more your metabolism is hyped up. Just make sure to keep carbs at a minimum to maximize fat-loss and protein at an absolute maximum to ensure lean muscle development.

I’m glad to hear that Monster Lo-Carb helped you lose weight. Although, it may not be the best way to lose weight.

How fast you can lose weight mainly depends on your metabolism, activity level and diet. One of the worst food to eat for weight management is junk food. Junk food usually have a lot of refined sugar (simple carb). Refined sugar causes a quick rise in glucose (blood sugar) levels. This also causes your pancreas to produce more insulin which is basically a storing agent. The more insulin you have in your body, the more glucose gets stored as fat.

This is why it is important to eat more complex carb than simple carb diets when it comes to weight management. One of the main reasons why Monster Lo-Carb is low in sugar and calories is because it uses sucralose (artificial sweetener) instead of sucrose (regular sugar). If you are pregnant, avoid drinking drinks with artificial sweeteners because they are like foreign agents to your body. Many artificial sweeteners are known to have toxic effects on the body.

Fruits and vegetables are one of the best foods for weight loss because they are very low in calories and very high in nutrients. Many of these nutrients are essential for increasing your metabolism and keeping your body healthy so it can use energy more efficiently.

Its 10 calories per serving, 2 servings per 16 oz can. So its 20 caloires for the entire can.
This stuff is delicious, I’m hooked!
 Reply countrygurl says: March 19, 2012 at 1:18 am 
Okay for one you should really look at the can because it does list everything on it and each can contains two servings in it so everything doubles.

I love low carb monster! I saw the post about losing weight and stepped it up a notch!

I drink monsters every morning as soon as I wake up, which has also shortened my commute to work because I drive 130 mph in a spastic frenzy!

At work I get all 8 hours of my work done in about 3 so the boss fired 2 of my co workers and I do what they used to after lunch. My lunch is 3 more 24 oz cans of lo-carb monster.

Sometime between 4 and 6 I black out but always come to at home naked in the front yard. The neighbor doesn’t mind she is an old widow and seeing a naked man is a big treat for her.

I usually don’t eat anything for dinner but I hve now replaced my usual 3 lines of coke with 3 cans of lo-carb monster. I have saved a lot of money because cocaine aint cheap these days!

I go out to the clubs and put the teens on X and diet pills to shame with my taurine and ginseng enhanced dance moves. After hooking up with at least 3 strangers it is time to go back to work and start all over again!

Anyway I have gone from 300 pounds to just over 110! My skin looks like a sharpay dog but the number on the scale makes me happy!

I too am hooked, I love this stuff. I’ve been drinking 2 cans (sometimes 3 cans) a day for YEARS now. Honestly I haven’t noticed any bad side effects. Only one thing is that I still have“Belly Fat”, I run 4 miles a day, I eat right (lots of fruits and veggies, no junk food, fast food, no breads, etc), Im wondering if the GLUCOSE that is in this drink could be the problem with the body storing the fat.
Like I said, Im hooked, but now wondering.

uh yeah…the glucose is definitely a problem but have you taken into consideration the harmful side-affects of consuming that ridiculous amount of caffeine daily? dude…use your head

 Reply Shelby says: November 7, 2011 at 4:16 pm 
I will give you a real review. Ive struggled with weight for the past 2yrs, and being pregnant skyrocketed it. After the baby was here, monsters were my coffee. I needed the energy that coffee just couldn’t give me. My weight has fallen off, all the baby weight was gone in 9wks, and it’s been 6 months total, and I’m now to my previous weight from before 2 years ago.
I didn’t use Monsters as a weight loss product, but whatever my body was lacking, it gave me. Besides loving the energy boost, the guarana in it is what I believe helped my weight loss, as it is an appetite suppressant.
I think I was one of the‘lucky’ones, but I don’t recommend it for weight loss.
