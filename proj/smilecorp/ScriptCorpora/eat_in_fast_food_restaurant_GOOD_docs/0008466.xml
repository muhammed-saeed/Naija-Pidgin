 BL Zoning 


 What is BL Zoning? 
 
 
 Zoning is complicated, but it determines how a piece of land can be used by its owners.  Zoning decisions should be made carefully, since they can result in uses that forever change the look and feel of the land. 

 The following is quoted from &quot;A Citizen&apos;s Guide to Planning in Baltimore County&quot; about Business Local (BL) zoning: 
 
 &quot;Typical Uses Permitted by Right: Retail sales, personal services, restaurant, bank, office, tavern, food store, medical clinic. 

 Typical Uses Permitted by Special Exception: Arcade, car wash, service garage, hotel/motel, funeral establishment, golf course, driving range, animal boarding place Class A, theatre.&quot; 
 
 Perhaps a simpler way to see what BL zoning means is to look at what is already zoned BL.  Much of the Frederick Road business district is zoned BL-CCC as has been requested for Newburg Ave.  This includes almost all the businesses on the South side of Frederick from Holmehurst Ave. to Sanford Ave. and all of the businesses on the North side of Frederick from Melvin Ave. to St. Timothy&apos;s Lane, including the shopping plaza behind Friendly&apos;s. This includes stores, restaurants, banks, bars, convenience stores, offices, and a fast food restaurant with a drive through window.  These are important businesses to have on the main street of Catonsville, but they do not belong on residential side streets.
