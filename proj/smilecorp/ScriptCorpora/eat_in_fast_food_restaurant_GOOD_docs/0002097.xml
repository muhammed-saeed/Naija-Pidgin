As part of the agreement, BKC has licensed the primary paint scheme on the #83 and 93 Toyota Camry Sprint Cup cars, which debuted during Monday&apos;s delayed NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Daytona International Speedway. &quot;I&apos;m extremely happy to welcome Burger King Corp. to the team and really proud to be associated with such a great brand,&quot; said Scott Gunderson, president and co-owner of BK Racing LLC and a Burger King franchisee. &quot;This demonstrates another important step in getting the BK Racing team ready for the season.

 Johnson talks about Daytona 500 wreck: UPDATE: #48-Jimmie Johnson  Sidelined in multi-car crash on lap 2 of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on Monday, February 27, 2012, his comments from a Chevy PR:
 LOOKED LIKE A HARD HIT. FIRST ARE YOU OK? WHAT HAPPENED? 
 Johnson: &quot;Yes, I&apos;m ok. That side hit was hard. We were all just trying to make our lane work. A lot of energy in the lane. I was kind of pushing the No. 78 (Regan Smith) a little bit. I could feel some help from behind. Just turned me around. Sent me down to the inside lane and back up to the outside lane. When I was l sitting in the middle of the race track, I knew at some point someone was going to come along unfortunately. David Ragan had nowhere to go. I unfortunately got drilled by him pretty hard. I&apos;m just really, really bummed to start the season this way. For all the hard work that has gone into getting this Lowe&apos;s Chevrolet ready for tonight; we didn&apos;t get to complete two-and-a-half miles of green flag racing. So, I&apos;m pretty bummed.&quot;
 ARE YOU OK? &quot;I&apos;m ok. I&apos;m just really bummed-out for this whole Lowe&apos;s team. To work as hard as everyone did at Hendrick Motorsports to get this Lowe&apos;s Chevrolet and to have it barely complete two-and-a-half miles of green flag racing is pretty sad. Disappointed, but nothing I can do about it now. We&apos;ll just go on and go to Phoenix and set our marks on winning that race.&quot;
 DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED? &quot;We were all just getting up to speed and I had some help from behind that got me out of control. From there on I was just spinning.&quot;(Chevy PR)(2-28-2012)
 UPDATE: Tuesday (Feb. 28) evening&apos;s edition of the NASCAR Race Hub on SPEED wrapped up a wild Daytona 500 with Elliott Sadler, driver of the #33 Richard Childress Racing Chevy, who re-capped his incident with five-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion, Jimmie Johnson. He spoke with host Danielle Trotta about what happened. &quot;I just kind of got into the back of Jimmie, it was 100-percent my fault,&quot; said Sadler, describing the incident that started as the field had just entered the race&apos;s second lap. &quot;It got other cars involved like you see in a lot of the restrictor plate races. We were coming into the outside lane, through the tri-oval, the #78 (Regan Smith) and the #48 (Jimmie Johnson) kind of get bunched up a little bit. They came down and its 100-percent my fault in getting into the back of Jimmie. We were kind of bogged down, everyone was side-by-side and I didn&apos;t check up in time, and I got into the left-rear quarter (panel) of Jimmie. It was just a little bit, but that is usually all it takes at these types of speeds. It&apos;s a bad way to get started.&quot;(SPEED)(2-29-2012)
 
 CRVA exec to focus on NASCAR Hall: Charlotte&apos;s top tourism official said Monday he is working to fully integrate different parts of the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, and said a top priority is to convince people attending conventions to visit the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Tom Murray, who was hired as CRVA chief executive in December, gave a briefing to the Charlotte City Council about his reorganization of upper management. The biggest change is that former CEO Tim Newman is no longer with the organization. Newman, who was demoted by the board after the council members questioned his management, had stayed with the CRVA as an executive in charge of sales. But he stepped down Friday. The new CRVA will have six people working directly under Murray as part of an executive management team. Murray said he wants to have the different aspects of the CRVA - sales, marketing and management of city-owned venues - working together smoothly. The CRVA was created in 2004 as a merger of Visit Charlotte and the Auditorium-Coliseum-Convention Center Authority. Murray said his next goal is to improve attendance at the NASCAR Hall of Fame, which lost $1.4 million in its first year. His goal is to have the racing museum break even financially or turn a profit, he said. Murray said new lower ticket prices for local people have been successful, and that the hall may try to offer discounted tickets to convention attendees in the future. The CRVA has said it has struggled to convince convention attendees to visit the hall. Murray also said Monday he &quot;never considered&quot; replacing current NASCAR hall Executive Director Winston Kelley. Kelley is now listed as a CRVA vice president in addition to heading the NASCAR hall. The other vice presidents are Ted Lewis (convention center); Bob Buchanan (human resources); Mike Crum (chief financial officer); Mike Butts (Visit Charlotte) and Gina Sheridan (marketing).( Charlotte Observer )(2-29-2012)

 Update on jet dryer driver from Daytona 500 accident: Michigan International Speedway had three jet dryers and two employees at Daytona International Speedway assisting with Monday&apos;s Daytona 500. The jet dryer driven by Duane Barnes, 52, of Addison, Mich., was hit from behind by #42-Juan Pablo Montoya during a caution. Barnes was released from Halifax Medical Center after a precautionary evaluation by doctors late Monday night. He returned to the racetrack to watch the end of the race. Barnes has worked in the Maintenance Department at Michigan International Speedway for 24 years. He has frequently assisted other International Speedway Corporation-owned racetracks, driving jet dryers at those events. MIS supports other racetracks by sending staff and equipment to events. Barnes is surprised at the outpouring of well wishes, and thanks everyone for their concern. &quot;I appreciate everyone for taking the time to write, call and ask how I am. I am OK and I am amazed at how many people have wished me well. I am also glad Juan Pablo Montoya is OK, and thank him for his concern,&quot; Barnes said.(MIS)(2-28-2012)
 
 NASCAR Statement on Brad Keselowski&apos;s Use of Social Media During the Daytona 500: NASCAR will not penalize #2-Brad Keselowski for his use of Twitter during last night&apos;s Daytona 500. Nothing we&apos;ve seen from Keselowski violates any current rules pertaining to the use of social media during races. As such, he won&apos;t be penalized. We encourage our drivers to use social media to express themselves as long as they do so without risking their safety or that of others.(NASCAR)(2-28-2012)
 
 Cena forced to back out: John Cena, the former WWE champion, had originally planned to honor his commitment as the honorary starter for Monday&apos;s Daytona 500 before hoping on a plane to fly to Portland, Oregon for his appearance on Monday Night Raw. However, with the race starting at night, Cena was forced to back out of his commitment but not before stopping by the media center to promise to pay for a charter plane back to Daytona if the race is postponed until Tuesday. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen a more stand-up guy,&quot; said Daytona International Speedway President Joie Chitwood. &quot;He has an open invitation to come back to any of our events, anytime.&quot;( Orlando Sentinel ), Cena was scheduled to wave the green flag on Sunday, then when it was postponed, he was to also give the command to start engines.(2-28-2012)
 
 Daytona 500 TV Ratings (lots of info here): Fox&apos;s impromptu primetime coverage of a rain-delayed Daytona 500 rained on everyone else&apos;s parade, driving almost every rival down in viewership. What&apos;s more, by averaging 14.24 million total viewers and a 4.5 demo rating, Fox&apos;s NASCAR coverage about doubled its typical House/Alcatraz numbers and thus led the network to a rare Monday win on both counts ( tvline.com )
 AND Fox earned a 7.7 overnight Nielsen rating for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Daytona 500&apos;s debut in primetime, which saw Matt Kenseth take the checkered flag. That figure is down 6% from an 8.2 overnight for Trevor Bayne&apos;s win last year, which aired on a Sunday afternoon ( Sports Business Daily ).
 AND II: Fox carried special coverage of the Daytona 500, which was delayed from Sunday by rain, and it averaged a 4.5 adults 18-49 rating and 11 share from 8 to 11 p.m., according to Nielsen overnights, just ahead of NBC&apos;s 4.4/11. But the Daytona 500 was not the night&apos;s top show. That honor once again went to NBC&apos;s &quot;The Voice,&quot; which averaged a 5.4 from 8 to 10 p.m., down 7 percent from the previous week but once again dominating its timeslot. Ratings for Fox&apos;s NASCAR coverage are approximate as fast nationals measure timeslot and not actual program data. Fox also finished first for the night among households with an 8.1 average overnight rating and a 12 share. NBC was second at 7.3/11, CBS third at 6.3/10, ABC fourth at 5.6/9, Univision fifth at 1.8/3, CW sixth at 0.9/1 and Telemundo seventh at 0.7/1.( Media Life Magazine )
 UPDATE The 54th DAYTONA 500, a race with fire, rain, and everything but the brimstone, earned a 7.7/13 in the metered markets last night on FOX. The race was interrupted for roughly two hours by a bizarre incident in which Juan Pablo Montoya crashed into a jet dryer under caution, causing an on-track explosion and fire. In keeping with Nielsen policy FOX is able to exclude most of the delay from the race rating, just as we would for a baseball rain delay. Last night&apos;s 7.7/13 is an average of the 7.8/12 FOX averaged from 7:15-10:30pm and the 7.3/17 that was earned from Midnight to 1am. The excluded portion averaged a 7.3/13 from 10:30pm-Midnight.
- Last night&apos;s 7.7/13 is off -6% compared to last year&apos;s 8.2/18, which ran without interruption on a Sunday afternoon. It&apos;s also +10% better than 2010&apos;s 7.0/14 for the infamous &quot;pothole 500&quot; which was delayed twice for track repair. Prior to last night&apos;s red-flag delay the primetime race was actually pacing very slightly ahead of last year. Last night&apos;s race averaged a 7.8/12 from 7:15-10:30pm compared to a 7.7/17 for the comparable duration last year.
A total audience of over 36.5 million Americans watched last night&apos;s race, according to fast national ratings issued today by Nielsen Media Research, making 2012 Daytona 500 the most-watched in FOX history. The 36.5 million total viewers, a measure of the audience that saw at least a portion of the race, is +22% higher than last year&apos;s total audience of 30 million and +22% better than 2010&apos;s 29.8 million. Yesterday&apos;s total audience is the second best ever for a Daytona 500 on any network behind 37.0 million viewers in 2006 on NBC.(Fox)(2-28-2012)
 
 The Daytona 500 Trophy.....Harley J. Earl trophy, who was Earl? If there&apos;s one trophy a driver dreams of putting his hands on, it&apos;s the Harley J. Earl trophy. Awarded to the winner of the Daytona 500, the Harley J. Earl trophy is one of the most prized possessions in motorsports.
Named after Harley J. Earl, a famous General Motors designer and friend of NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., the Harley J. Earl Perpetual Trophy rests year round inside The Daytona 500 Experience , &quot;The Official Motorsports Attraction of NASCAR,&quot; and bears the name of every Daytona 500 champion.
Each year, the Harley J. Earl Perpetual Trophy makes a trip outside the attraction to the hallowed grounds of Gatorade Victory Lane at the &quot;World Center of Racing&quot; for a meeting with the Daytona 500 champion.
While the Daytona 500 champion doesn&apos;t take home the Harley J. Earl trophy, the winner of the &quot;Great American Race&quot; is awarded a replica Harley J. Earl trophy, which has a black base with a scaled-down replica of the Firebird One that Earl created in 1954 at the peak of his career with General Motors.
For the 50th running of the Daytona 500, the trophy was painted gold. The Harley J. Earl trophy is just one of three trophies awarded on the day of the Daytona 500.
The winning crew chief of the Daytona 500 champion is awarded the Cannonball Baker trophy, which is named after the famous coast-to-coast racer who was elected the first national commissioner of NASCAR in 1948 while the owner of the winning Daytona 500 champion is awarded the Governor&apos;s Cup.(DIS PR)
Richard Earl, a former Wall Street broker, makes his living selling Harley Earl-designed cars. &quot; &apos;Motoramic masterpieces&apos; is how I like to refer to them,&quot; he said. He maintains the official Harley Earl Web site, carofthecentury.com , and is working on a biography of his grandfather.(2-28-2012)

 Roush Fenway Scores Historic 300th Victory with Daytona 500 Win: Roush Fenway Racing officially kicked off it&apos;s 25th Anniversary season in grand fashion on Monday night, with #17-Matt Kenseth holding off teammate #16-Greg Biffle as the organization claimed its historic 300th NASCAR victory with its second Daytona 500 victory in the first ever night-time running of the famed event at Daytona International Speedway.
&quot;It feels great,&quot; said Kenseth. &quot;We even went overtime a little bit since we didn&apos;t quite go the whole distance the first time we won it. We had a really fast car all day and overcame a lot of adversity and problems with the car that we figured out. We had a great pit stop at the end that put us into position. It feels great. I wasn&apos;t expecting to win when I woke up this morning so it feels good to be sitting here.&quot;
Kenseth and Biffle combined to lead 83 of 200 laps in the race, with Kenseth taking the lead for the final time with 37 laps remaining and holding the point until the race&apos;s conclusion with a green-white-checkered finish. With the victory, Roush Fenway becomes the first team in NASCAR history to win 300 races.
&quot;This is a special night,&quot; said team co-owner Jack Roush. &quot;It feels great. It is very fitting that Matt won the 300th victory that we have had since we started in 1988 and (crew chief) Jimmy Fennig has been with us for most of the time and Matt has been here most of the time as well. It is great to celebrate our 300th win here with the 54th Daytona 500. This is Matt&apos;s second 500 win and that makes it special as well.&quot;(Roush Fenway Racing)(2-28-2012)

Rich, a major part of the FOX8 Family for decades, died of a heart attack Monday night, according to his wife, Judy. He was 65 years old.

 Casino in Loudon promoted: The New Hampshire Motor Speedway on Route 106 in Loudon, NH is among the largest sports and entertainment venues in New England, drawing 600,000 patrons a year, hosting the only NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series events held in the region, as well as numerous other events. &quot;This would seem to be the natural place for New Hampshire to put a casino,&quot; said the speedway&apos;s general manager, Jerry Gappens. &quot;We&apos;re already bringing thousands of people in here regularly, and over the years, I think we&apos;ve proven we can handle it.&quot;
State lawmakers, in part responding to the advent of casino gambling in Maine and Massachusetts, held a hearing recently to consider amending the already controversial legislation, House Bill 593, that would allow casino gambling in the state. The amendment could double the originally proposed two casinos to four, allowing for one large casino with up to 150 table games and 5,000 slot machines, while the others could have up to 60 table games and 2,000 slots. The bill goes before a committee next week. It won&apos;t come before the full House for a vote until March, after the Legislature&apos;s winter break. In a letter to lawmakers, Gappens expressed a &quot;strong and sincere interest&quot; in expanding the speedway into a gambling facility on the speedway&apos;s 11,000 acres. Gappens, speaking from his speedway office Thursday, said the positive gains for the town, the region and the state make it the ideal site for a casino. &quot;The opportunities and vision for this are limitless,&quot; he said. There is doubt whether the casino bill will pass, and both gambling supporters and opponents are scrambling to shore up votes. The House has never passed a gambling bill, and it would require a two-thirds majority to override the promised veto by Gov. John Lynch.( New Hampshire Union Leader )(2-28-2012)

 Montoya comments about accident with Safety Truck / Jet Dryer at Daytona: #42-Juan Pablo Montoya  Sidelined in crash with jet dryer truck on lap 160 of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway.
YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A LIMP, ARE YOU OK? 
 Montoya: &quot;I&apos;m ok. My foot hurt, but I&apos;m ok. For as big of a hit that way; I&apos;m pretty good to be honest.&quot;
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?
 Montoya: &quot;Something fell in the rear of the car and the car just spun into the jet dryer. I felt a vibration and came in. They looked at everything and everything was ok and I still told them &apos;I think there is something broke&apos; and I was coming back into the pits and the car just spun by itself.&quot;
DID YOU TALK TO THE DRIVER OF THE JET DRYER TRUCK?
 Montoya: &quot;He came with me (in the ambulance). He was pretty scared, but he looked ok.&quot;
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?
 Montoya: &quot;I told them when I left the pits something wasn&apos;t right and I felt a weird vibration when we were with the pack. Every time I got on the gas, it vibrated. So, I came back in and they checked all the rear-end and they said it was ok. I was going down the back straightaway, and I was going in fourth gear, but, we weren&apos;t even going that fast. Every time I got on the gas I could feel the rear really squeezing. I got on the brakes to travel up and while I was telling the spotter to have a look on how the rear was moving, the car just turned right.&quot;
WE ARE GLAD YOU ARE ALL RIGHT
 Montoya: &quot;To be honest with you, it is tough. We were running a really smart race. Everyone on the Target Chevy really did a good job today. Just move on to Phoenix.&quot;
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?
 Montoya: &quot;I did the pit stop and when I came out of the pits I felt a vibration in second gear. I told them I think either a transmission broke or something. I went to third gear and when I accelerated the vibration came back. I came back into the pits, they looked at everything tight and ok. I went again and I was in fourth gear. I wasn&apos;t even going that fast and it was moving and traveling a lot. It just felt really strange, as I was talking on the radio the car just turned right.&quot;
DID YOU HEAR THE EXPLOSION?
 Montoya: &quot;Oh yeah, it burned the helmet and everything. It&apos;s not where you want to finish the Daytona 500. Everybody on the Target team, with this great Chevy car, did an amazing job today. We didn&apos;t bump anybody, nobody bumped us, and we only had 40 laps to go. I thought we had a great car. I thought we were in the right place. Everything was working well and go through that, it sucks.&quot;
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
 Montoya: &quot;My foot hurts. I was full on the brakes and when I hit, I hit driver&apos;s side and my foot slipped onto the clutch and it scratched the top of my foot.&quot;
THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST BIZARRE INCIDENTS WE HAVE SEEN
 Montoya: &quot;I have hit a lot of things, but a jet dryer? I mean, no.&quot;
WHAT WAS THE TRACK LIKE? DID YOU GET TO SEE THE SURFACE OF THE TRACK?
 Montoya: &quot;No, I was too busy. I really got out of the car fast. I looked up and I saw the guy out of the jet dryer. I saw a little bit of fire, my car was on fire. I saw the ambulance and walked to the ambulance.&quot;
WERE YOU PLEASED AT HOW QUICKLY YOU WERE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE CAR?
 Montoya: &quot;I am always really quick to get out of the car. In open-wheel they always check you at the beginning of the year and you have a certain time you have to get out. You really learn to get out of the car fast.&quot;
THE PERSON IN THE JET DRYER IS OK CORRECT?
 Montoya: &quot;I am sure he is pretty shaken and is going to be sore, but I think he is ok.&quot;
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU REALIZED YOU WERE GOING TO HIT THE TRUCK?
 Montoya: &quot;I didn&apos;t think about the truck, I thought &apos;I&apos;m actually hitting the jet and it&apos;s not going to be fun.&apos; Before I got there I was thinking &apos;this thing is going to be on fire pretty bad&apos; and it was.&quot;(Chevy PR)(2-27-2012)
 
 Some Daytona 500 Nuggets from Frontstretch: 
#99-Carl Edwards (starts 1st): Trying to become the first polesitter to win the Daytona 500 since Dale Jarrett in 2000. None of Edwards&apos; 19 career victories have come on a restrictor plate track.
#16-Greg Biffle (2nd): Seeking to become the first *outside polesitter* to win Daytona since Dale Jarrett (again, not a misprint) in 1993. How bad has it been to be on the outside of the front row? In the last six Daytona 500s, second-place starters have finished inside the top 10 just once.
#14-Tony Stewart (3rd): Looking to end an 0-for-13 streak at the Daytona 500 despite 17 career wins there in various series. He would also be the first reigning champion to win the 500 since Dale Jarrett in 2000.
#88-Dale Earnhardt, Jr. (5th): Seeking to snap his winless streak at a whopping 129 Sprint Cup races. A second Daytona 500 trophy would also give him more than his Hall of Fame father, who won the event just once, in 1998.
#9-Marcos Ambrose (7th): With a win, becomes the first foreign-born winner of the Daytona 500 since Mario Andretti back in _1967.
#24-Jeff Gordon (16th) - Seeking a fourth 500 victory, an accomplishment that would leave him second all-time only to Richard Petty&apos;s seven with Cale Yarborough who has four.
#55-Mark Martin (22nd) - Bidding to become the oldest driver in history to win a Cup race, let alone break an ominous 0-for-27 track record in the 500. Harry Gant currently holds the record: he was 52 years, seven months and six days old when winning Michigan in August of 1992.
#10-Danica Patrick (29th) - Needs a 10th or better to become the highest-finishing woman in the history of the Daytona 500. Janet Guthrie (1980) holds the record with an 11th-place result.
#42-Juan Pablo Montoya (35th) - See Ambrose above re: foreign-born driver. Montoya is also bidding to be the first former Formula One driver to win it since Andretti in &apos;67.
#21-Trevor Bayne (40th) - Everyone remembers the upset of the NASCAR season last February. If the 21-year-old can do it again, he&apos;d be the first back-to-back Daytona 500 winner since Sterling Marlin in 1994-95. Only two other drivers have ever done it, and both are Hall of Famers: Richard Petty (1973-74) and Cale Yarborough (1983-84).
#32-Terry Labonte (43rd) - The two-time Cup Series champion is making his 30th career start at Daytona... but he&apos;s never captured the 500. Only Dave Marcis (0-for-32) has run more Daytona 500s without scoring a victory.(se a few more at frontstretch.com )(2-27-2012)
