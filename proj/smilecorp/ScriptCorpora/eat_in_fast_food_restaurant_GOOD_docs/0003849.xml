 Starbucks, Immovable Giant 
 by Candice Watters on 10/23/2007 at 10:16 AM 
 
I had my first cup of Starbucks 14 years ago in Washington, D.C. It was a skinny iced latte with a pack of Equal stirred in after the fact. (I didn&apos;t learn till a decade later that if you want an iced latte sweet, you have to add the sweetener while the coffee&apos;s still hot or it just sits on the bottom of the cup.) I remember wondering what the hype was all about. But like so many coffee lovers, I got hooked -- and eventually moved on to more interesting drinks.

Lately, though, I&apos;ve been in a bit of a boycott mood. I rarely go to Starbucks anymore and when I do, I get the tall brew of the day, $1.66 at last count. I just can&apos;t bear paying over $3.50 for a single cup of flavored coffee. Apparently me staying away because they&apos;re overpriced is doing little to hurt the behemoth. Did you know Starbucks has had 14 straight years of growth?

According to a new unauthorized biography of the company, reviewed in the November issue of Fast Company magazine:
 
* Starbucks&apos;s closest competitor in the coffeehouse market, Caribou Coffee, is just one-twenty-fifth its size. Every 10 weeks, Starbucks opens as many stores as the total number of Caribou outlets.

* Contrary to popular opinion, Starbucks increases sales at rival nearby coffeehouses.

* The average customer spends $4.05 per visit for coffee; the average fast-food-restaurant visitor spends $4.34 for an entire meal.

* For a cup that costs $3.40, at least 40 cents is profit. When Starbucks bumped the 8-ounce cup off the menu, the 10-ounce&quot;tall&quot;increased profits by 25 cents per cup for only 2 cents of added product.
 
I like Starbucks&apos; coffee and the coffeehouse environment. But their in-store prices leave me with a bitter aftertaste.

I&apos;m with you on this one Candice. I&apos;m a former Starbucks lover who simply won&apos;t pay their prices anymore. I can brew my own cup for $.15 and enjoy it almost as much. Ahh, sweet savings. :) That&apos;s not to say that I stand outside if my friends are going, but as a general rule, they don&apos;t get my money any more.

I think the passionate topics on this blog are 1) the dating/courtship/marriage debates 2) political issues 3) COFFEE! ;)

I go to my local coffee purveyor as frequently as I can. Better coffee, the people recognize me, and I&apos;m supporting a community endeavor.

Sure, it doesn&apos;t really&quot;hurt&quot;Starbucks, but it does *help* the hometown guy.

I&apos;ve slowed down going to Starbucks just recently, partly because of their prices and partly because of some of the places their money goes. I don&apos;t want my money going to those causes, so I stop that by not giving it to them in the first place. Lately I&apos;ve been going to a local place that has a few stores in our metro area (Jackson, MS). The coffee tastes better and is a lot cheaper, and they give parts of their proceeds to local charities and educational endeavors that are a bit more on the up-and-up.

I&apos;ve never really understood the whole Starbucks phenomenon myself. I could see going to it in a small town where it&apos;s the only coffee house around, but most decent sized municipalities have at least one local coffee shop with a cooler atmosphere, better product, and lower prices.

DT, good point, but how far do we go in supporting businesses whose giving or ownership are questionable?

For example, Caribou Coffee is majority-owned by an Islamic bank that has been linked to&quot;charities&quot;that support terrorists.

While Starbucks is certainly not a necessity, can we in reality live out this principle in everyday life?

I like the fact that Starbucks treats it&apos;s employees really well (at least from the people I&apos;ve talked to and stuff)...and who says that starbucks people don&apos;t know your name...the one by my house and I are on a first name basis...mostly cuz I used to get the same thing everymorning...

That being said...most of their specialty drinks along with pricy are also full of empty calories that went right to my hips....so I did away with that (lost 20 lbs) and only either drink my black coffee, or tea....

so I don&apos;t give starbucks all my money anymore.

More and more Starbucks are popping up in those highway-side rest stops/shopping centers. They&apos;re decent&quot;known quantities&quot;when your only other options are McDonald&apos;s and a mysterious dirty-looking roadside stop.

(Now, I recognize many of you may favor the mysterious roadside stops. But they aren&apos;t always good choices for, er, practical reasons, and they can be sketchy.)

Their Pumpkin Spice Latte is a pretty good drink. Almost worth the $4 they charge.

I don&apos;t like the taste of Starbucks&apos;coffee. They roast it in such a way that it has a burnt flavor.

Also, I recently learned that Starbucks owns Seattle&apos;s Best Coffee. We have two Starbucks in our office building, and one S.B.

The point isn&apos;t the COFFEE-- it&apos;s the EXPERIENCE. And yes, hometown coffee shops are different, but Starbucks has proved that it brings a lovable experience that millions are willing to pay for. It is part of my daily routine (I&apos;ve figured out ways to get it for free--credit card points etc...) and I LOVE it. They take care of their employees and they take care of their followers. They randomly send me free cds in the mail along with other gifts, just to thanke me for my faithfulness. It&apos;s quite a concept. Read the book by the Founder-- gives a fascinating and fun concept that shows the business AND the ministry concepts that can be learned from Starbucks... $5 and all!

&gt;&gt;I could see going to it in a small town where it&apos;s the only coffee house around,&lt;&lt;

Interestingly enough, they tend to only locate in areas with favorable demographics. In my home town, for example, they refuse to put one. There&apos;s one inside a grocery store, but that&apos;s it. Meanwhile, there are at least 5-10 locally owned coffee shops in town selling fresh gourmet coffee in all the varieties, including a few drive-throughs.

Meanwhile, the town I live in now has at least 12 starbucks that I can remember off the top of my head.

I just moved to a new town and am currently depressed that my only coffeehouse options are Starbucks and Caribou! None of the locations provide a warm or friendly atmosphere that I&apos;d choose to go to when I want to read or study.

What happened to all the small-town coffee house lovin&apos;?!

As a coffee professional myself it is easy to hate on *$ for their quality mostly...they are the Mc Donalds of coffee.(wait isn&apos;t mcdonalds the Mc Donalds of coffee?) Any way. Readers here may or may not be aware but *$ is a major backer of the Homosexual agenda and routinely sponsors Gay pride events throught the country. I was helping in an outreach to Homsexuals at the last Gay Pride Parade in Philly and even saw a *$ float!
So to me it is more than their poor quality that drives me away but I do not want my money to go to helping the Enemy and his assualt on Gods Kingdom throught the Homosexual Agenda.

I&apos;ve only purchased something from a Starbucks once, and that only because I had a crush on one of the women working there. I just can’t convince myself to pay that much for a drink.

StarBuckeys! Yeah they are way over priced and on top of ripping you off for a nice cup of joe they charge you to get on the internet, there is no free wireless. Starbucks and Apple could merge and form the world super power I think. The sad part about SBux is that because they make so much they are willing to pay more for coffee than anyone else so smaller independant coffee shops are closing because they cannot afford the standard SBux has created in price for coffee. I try to find independant coffee shops around the city with free wireless, plus you get to meet all kind of different people who notice you reading your bible and praying so doors open to tell&apos;em about jesus.

Starbucks has probably done more than any other company or image brand to create and perpetuate coffee culture in the US. I can definitely see them boosting overall coffee sales in an area--including competitors--because

A. Non-coffee drinkers or casual drinkers become more aware/interested

B. Opponents of Starbucks may be more likely to visit the locally competing coffee shops, if only as a statement.

While I generally prefer certain local shops where I&apos;ve lived (superior coffee), I do enjoy the sight of a Starbucks when traveling. I know what I&apos;m going to get there, and when I learn that I&apos;m going to be stuck in the Detroit airport for the night there&apos;s nothing that quite says&apos;comfort&apos;like a raspberry-vanilla latte.

I&apos;m with Anne on this one. I avoid Starbucks when I can, and make most of the hot drinks at home that 2 years ago I would buy. But, if I have a meeting or just am in need of a warm drink, I go for the tea. On a side note, I&apos;ve found that if you carry tea bags with you (I do to make sure I can enjoy if the store doesn&apos;t carry a brand that I like) many times you will only be charged for the hot water / cup(if it&apos;s a throw away)and that&apos;s in the under .50 range. :-) Maybe I&apos;m just too cheap.....

Starbucks sells a good product and employs thousands of people. Why the resentment against a business that has been successful? My recommendation? Starbucks makes a great cup of regular coffee. With skim milk and a tiny bit of sugar, it&apos;s healthy and tasty--coffee has strong antioxidant properties when not flooded with sweetener. And simple coffee is about $1.50 to $2.00.

Adam,
Starbucks does not pay top dollar for the best coffee. They buy average grade to poor quality in bulk. Just like walmart. the high priced coffees and high quality coffees are one spurchased by mid size or small roasting operations like Inelligentsia Coffee in Chicago or Stumptown Coffee in Portland, OR. While bux large scale purchasing of mediocre quality beans means they can price more competively...that fact has no bearing on the quality of the bean they purchase or the brew they serve.
You should check out the&quot;Cup of excellence&quot;auctions...this is where real quailty is found

I&apos;m a roaster and barista in Peoria, IL, who knows and loves coffee, so I thought I&apos;d throw my $.02 into the tip jar.

My company used to be a two-counter store until starbucks moved into our town (5 stores in 2 years). Now we&apos;re a one-counter store. Starbucks grabs the&quot;coffee of opportunity&quot;traffic through sheer name recognition alone, and gets the&quot;want to be seen with the cup&quot;traffic in much the same way. And sadly, there&apos;s weren&apos;t enough people who fit themselves into the&quot;want to drink good coffee&quot;demographic in our area to keep our other store open.

I found this amusing, as many of our regulars were starbucks employees and managers. I have heard good things about how they treat their employees and the quality of their training. Which is interesting, because most starbucks workers can now identify good coffee... and know that they can&apos;t get it at work. How droll.

I really don&apos;t have any intrinsic problems with the mighty&apos;bucks, but let&apos;s just call it what it is: they sell identity, not coffee. They could sell cups of water in those white-and-green cups out of their trendy cafés and people would buy them.

second the CoE recommendation @ adam
our café got some from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. They all rocked my face right off.

I find that Starucks is more about the experience than anything. It&apos;s a favorite hang out for many of my friends. Also, unless I&apos;m in a city where I know a great hole in the wall coffe shop is located...then it&apos;s Starbucks for me.

Starbucks isn&apos;t at all about the coffee; they sell relaxation and taking a moment to pause in one&apos;s day.

LOL...&apos;makes me feel so much better as I, too, can&apos;t stand the over-roasted coffee -- and never understood what the all the coffee commotion was all about.

When speaking with people of an older generation, a person who drank more than 2 cups (12 ounces) of coffee was going to FLOAT away and was considered a bit odd. Why has it become normal to drink 20-30 ounces of coffee?? Its not my body, but its sure a curious thing -- this coffee!

Methinks the very best coffee is brewed from home (made properly) and sipped while relaxing in the comfort of my cozy home!! What a concept, though, eh?

Thanks for sharing...What a fun subject on this site!!
