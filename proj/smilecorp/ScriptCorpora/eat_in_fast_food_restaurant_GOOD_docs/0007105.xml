Greenwich Village McDonald&apos;s Employee Beats Two Unruly Customers With a Metal Rod
 By Robert Sietsema Fri., Oct. 14 2011 at 5:20 PM Categories: Breaking News , Kerfuffles , Sietsema

 Yesterday morning in the early hours a McDonald&apos;s employee assaulted a pair of female customers with a metal rod. One was taken to the hospital with a fractured skull and broken arm, while the other sustained only minor cuts and bruises. Another patron of the world&apos;s largest fast-food chain managed to catch the melee on a cell-phone video posted on YouTube. Warning: This is not for the faint of heart.
 
 


The incident occurred at the 24-hour McDonald&apos;s at the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 3rd Street, and the assailant-employee was identified by the website DNAinfo.com as Rayon McIntosh .

Two women entered the McDonald&apos;s location a little after midnight on Thursday morning and soon got into an argument with McIntosh, one of the cashiers in the crowded store, after he told them he had to check a $50 bill they&apos;d just given him to make sure it wasn&apos;t counterfeit. The video shows the women -- identified as Denise Darbeau and Rachel Edwards -- vaulting over and going around the counter at McIntosh, who flees to the rear of the fast fooder. Then McIntosh re-emerges swinging what appears to be a metal rod or pipe, and chaos ensues.

McIntosh apparently had a criminal record when hired by the chain, having spent a 10-year stretch in prison after shooting to death a classmate at a Bronx high school.

Clearly, McDonald&apos;s doesn&apos;t do much of a background check on its employees.

McIntosh has been charged with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon, and the women with menacing, trespassing, and disorderly conduct.

They were lesbians so whats the difference?
 
I mean no disrespect, but honestly, this is why I&apos;m terrified of the US.
 
The man is a hero. More people should stand up for themselves like he did. Give him a raise and a commendation; and put the two psycho women in jail.
 
UMMMm He was attacked FIRST! Then TWO people coming were coming after him! What is he supposed to do!!! I think its bull you can&apos;t defend yourself! They are painting the wrong picture!
 
Ok, really!&quot;errbody&quot;obviously your ass is ghetto! seriously those women were not right for what they said but in customer service you have to take what customers throw at you! he should have alerted his manager and it would have ended there! He is a monster and had not right to do that! especially to a woman!
 
They got what they deserved!  Jumping behind the counter to attack someone who is trying to do his job?  He has every right to defend himself.
 
What the fuck is wrong with the turd who wrote this article?&quot;the assailant?&quot;. He was defending himself and now he&apos;s an&quot;assailant&quot;? And who the fuck cares if he had a criminal record? Is he supposed to let people jump him, slap him and do whatever the fuck they want to him just because he has a record? He&apos;s still a person and has the right to defend his life. I&apos;m glad he beat those ghetto hoes in court. They got EXACTLY what they deserved. Good for him.
 
If they wen over the counter and stabbed him what would be vour verdict judge?
 
He was doing his job and the attacked him...they got what they wanted..a super-sized beating. He should not go back to prison for that. Hell, he shouldn&apos;t be fired....written up..but not fired.
 
Wow, what&apos;s its like to go through live with such a submissive, slave mentality?

I hope you don&apos;t have kids.
 
This guy did nothing wrong, he is a hero.
 
the grand jury declined to charge the man with anything.  there is some justice in this world.  when will people learn that when you start something you had best plan on finishing it.
 
you are a dumb ass.  it was announced today that the grand jury declined to charge the man on basis of self defense.
 
Such a pity you weren&apos;t one of the attackers......then you would have gotten your ass busted and learn how to behave as a decent human being.Guess what? You probably should have been the guy over the counter...then we&apos;d see if you would have taken a beating or you would have retaliated......you are verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry unjustified.....your time will come
 
You and Assassyn36o need to shut your damn mouth....those hooligans jumped the counter and attacked the worker....he should have beaten them to a pulp.....bet you don&apos;t know  that he won them in court?
 
those 2 won&apos;t vault any more counters. bravo to mcdonalds employee!
 
Do you want to make $75 hourly and $8150 per month like me? just working on laptop for few hours. Would you like to be your own boss?  Opportunities like this don&apos;t come by often, so don&apos;t let this one pass you by! Here is the website...&lt;b&gt;MakeCash13.cøm&lt;/b&gt;
 
Not guilty. And good call....if you think you can attack an employee at their place of work...you deserve to get beat a little bit. (unlike the lefty-pinkos who would have you believe a nice tea and some talking would have sorted that mess out)
 
Point blank:They got their asses whipped... and they deserved it.  Maybe next time they go into a McDonald&apos;s they will think more clearly about creating an altercation.
 
We dont know while they were on the ground if they were reaching for something, a gun, knife... we cant see their actions so its hard to say.
 
those fucking black ghetto retards deserved to get some shit beat outta them
 
I really could not tell to much from the clip. But I think it is funny, a thing like this was caught on someone&apos;s cell phone all by accident. I smell a possible set up, so it could be on film. But if this worker was a felon, doesn&apos;t mean she was in the wrong from what the story pretty much said. If the two woman was jumping the counter, then that could be a&quot;robbery&quot;. So was self defense.
 
There is always something going on IN THAT LOCATION or OUTSIDE of it. It draws drama.
 
hell yea! to me that was the only one who made a scene. Her and those 2 she beast need to get fucked up! and locked away! The white evil bitch for distubing the peace and trying to make the innocent look guilty; and those wanabe med type bitches.
 
what is he supposed to do! he already took a hit shit it was payback time. Dont give or attempt to give a beatdown if you can not take one. And dont do the crime if you cant do the time.
 
Those she men got what they deserved especialy the first one who punched that man in the face. OH! you act like that never happen; its bad enough that the boy gets insulted, in one of the most demeaningful way. But to take a blow in the face followed by a chase and out of all places in a mcdonalds, as if it is&apos;nt embarrasing enough. I would have probably done something differernt some would have suggested,but tell me how many times you see a situation like this occure. Although, it may have looked horribly shocking i think those females really put themselves in harms way fourcefully. What any body would have done,is always easier said than done. But the reality of this is that a troublemaker will eventualy catch the come around. Oh and for what its worth it is written in the bible all dikes and fagots are going to be cut off if they do not get delivered. It is written that GOD thinks it is a abomination; and when GOD is&apos;nt taken seriously you will end up surrounded by nothing but evil. I feel no remorse evil because evil feels no remorse for me,nor will it or i ever for one another. So wake up!!  and as for that lady   screaming in the place, she did not have to raise her voice like that.
 
She was working on the theory that the social contract&quot;dogs don&apos;t bite bitches&quot;was in place no matter what. He just spent 10 in the care of NY DOC for murder 2. She made a mistake.
 
He was yelling stay down at these women. They came at him, tried to follow him to the back and continue their assault. He shouldn&apos;t have hit them once they were down, but they continued to try and get up. You deserve what you get when you pull shit like this.
 
Yet you&apos;re looking at ONE McDonald&apos;s store in the entire country. It could be the place it&apos;s located. It could just be the crew. I wouldn&apos;t want to get in the way of him. I know what that metal bar is, and it is dangerous. I&apos;ve worked as a grunt in one of these &apos;shitty&apos; McDonald&apos;s jobs as so many people put it for three years. NEVER in my store, have I seen a fight between a customer and an employee escalate to this. I&apos;ve seen two customers fight each other, and I have seen Customers Yell and scream at us. But the Crew I work with is able to disconnect with the customer before it escalates into something of this magnitude. And you know what? Of all the Problems McDonalds has, Who really started it?

The Cashier who only told a customer they didn&apos;t have nuggets, and was telling the truth?
Or the Customer who began assaulting the cashier because they didn&apos;t have nuggets. There was nothing the employee could do.

The cashier who said he needed to check a 50 then proceeded to get attacked by the customers... (Which I think he did go a little too far, but humans do go into blind rages...)


And now to get this off my chest:

Some customers treat us like shit, and I&apos;m sick and tired of people saying&quot;Oh, They work at McDonalds&quot;So? We work there to serve food to you.  Without us, You would have no burgers or fries you could get on your break from whatever nice job you have. Be grateful that we can put up with your bullshit about not removing the pickles, Or holding the tomato. We&apos;ll remake it for you. So be grateful it&apos;s not you working there and get on with your lives. And if you want to act up? Just remember it&apos;s you who&apos;s acting like a child. We&apos;ll be happy to remake your burger if you&apos;re nice to us. If you&apos;re rude to us? It makes us less likely to want to help you. Either way you get your food. One way just makes you look like an asshole.
 
Pathetic, these bottom feeders walk into a business and violated everyone’s security! Guaranteed these Walking welfare sperm banks will be walking away from McDonalds with Millions………  Follow that report!!  SICK!  This is our justice system!  They jumped the counter, and then attacked him! One does not assume they were asking for the secrete ingredients of the Big Mac,  No Questions, They jumped over the counter to inflict harm!!!!!! YOUR DEAD! That simple!!!!!!!  That man should have not even been arrested.  What the fuck is wrong with society? Those of you who don’t agree should drive down the north side tonight with your windows down. Park by a stop light, and leave your inside dome lights on and see how you feel about this situation in the morning. Did they deserve it, you bet your ass…. That was not anything compared to what most of us would have done had those trash ladies been attacking our family members!!!! Does society not understand this is not acceptable behavior?  These woman are not victims, they are the Violators!!!!!!WTF   Seriously, how fast would Jessie Jackson have been on the Today show had that man who had been violated been white? Poor little black girls beaten by a white racist… Federal Crime, automatic 10 years in Prison…  This world is fucked up!
 
I guess the village voice doesn&apos;t believe in the right to defend yourself. These two women initiated the violence.
 
This is poor excuse for journalism.  This guy is demonized by the media for defending himself.  The&quot;woman&quot;slapped him in the face then jumped the counter  and slapped him again. The other woman came around and the both had him backed in the corner.  What the hell was this guy supposed to do stand there and let them beat him. He didnt know if they had any weapons.  Should he have stopped when they were down? We dont know if they were really down.  We cant see what&apos;s going on under the counter. 
 His past had nothing to do with what happened in this incident.  Are you trying to tell me that people with a criminal record can&apos;t be victims too? They got every bit of what they deserved.
 
that was beatiful
 
No one knows the conversation that took place between the customer and cashier but whatever was said did not warrent that woman putting her hands on that man.  Nor was it just for the both of them to go behind that counter, one coming from each direction, to attack him.  If that was my children being confronted/attacked that way, I would want them to protect themselves.  I belive the guy felt cornered and simply did an instinctual thing -grab something and break their freaking bones. In lesser words, he was only protecting himself.  I know that anyone who watched that video would say the same unless you&apos;re just seeing color (WRONG) that has nothing to do with the issue. I&apos;m a woman of color and I say he was totally in the right to protect himself.    Brooklyngirl
 
you cant see behind the counter this guy guy did rite
 
If beating someone into unconsciousness saves my life and limbs I&apos;m going to do. If you have no problem with people abusing you that is on you.
 
Has anyone found records on either of these two unruly, disgruntled, disappointing females?  I am shocked to hear that the one named Denise Debrau acutally worked with the mentally disabled are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!  Who gave her that position?  A position she damn sure was not worthy of.  She can&apos;t even treat another human being properly...And her father has the nerve to say he does not want to hear about self defense....ok so you are telling us that she can go around thinking she can be a bully she/man and that&apos;s ok just take it because that is denise debrau my daughter....yeah right!  Well now your daughter is in the system now.  So let&apos;s see what happens with her.  Freeeee R. McIntosh...  And wait the other funny part of this is she yelled out racial insults and that was ok as well and called the man&apos;s mother a bitch but when he said it back he got slapped because her mother was not...........What the hell is the damn problem here do as i say not as i do!!!! Well boo guess this whole situation proved you wrong especially Rachel EDWARDS you go what you deserved you always want to play billy bad ass for everyone and always saying i am not scared of anyone....Guess you finallly met youR match.....Bet you will think from now on Ms. Impulvise and get help so you can move forward with your life.
 
I agree.  How often do you see ill-mannered menacing, rude and obnoxious people while waiting online.  I, have verbally defended the clerk/waiter more than once.  He should be not charged with any crime.  Clearly the man defended himself.
 
And there is the problem...we don&apos;t know what could have triggered him.  I may have been an elderly patron who couldn&apos;t see the menu, or took too long to get his wallet out.  That is the danger.  He snapped and couldn&apos;t stop himself.  I agree that he should have defended himself, because he didn&apos;t know what these two heifers were going to do to him, but he couldn&apos;t stop himself.
 
Them 2 bitches deserved that beatdown.  Even if the cashier was being rude, they have no right to slap at him and then jump the counter.  He was within his right to defend himself.  What bothers me most is how quickly people forget.  About 6-7 years ago a group of thugged out hoodrats - about 4 of them - beat and stabbed a man in the same WV area b/c he hit on one of them.  He said he was laughed at by cops and other guys on the street after the incident, but if he would&apos;ve taken the route Mr. McIntosh did, then he would&apos;ve been vilified for hitting a woman.  The days of&quot;never putting your hands on a woman&quot;are over, these hoodrats go looking for trouble and then expect to be&quot;treated&quot;like women when they cross a line and realize a dude is willing to hit back.  FREE MCINTOSH!!!!!!!!!!!
 
I hope those bitches get raped by gang of filthy monkeys.  They deserve it because they are baboons.
 
can we get a name on that annoying lady too???
 
Everyone in the hood should carry a metal rod. Every civilized member of society should carry a gun. Problem solved. Darwinism with a twist of much needed genocide.
 
And I&apos;m female, by the way. Too many women think they can get away with anything, the adult version of the snotty little girl on the playground who provokes the boys, hits them, kicks them, draws them on and then tattles and smirks while they get in trouble. I think it will be a long time before those two idiots decide to assault a cashier again.
 
Talk about biased reporting. They attacked HIM. For all he knew, they were armed. Most businesses have a weapon like this, for just this reason - a violent customer coming after you. The minute those women breached the front counter, the employees were justified in thinking they were being attacked. Why report this as if this man just cold-bloodedly ran out and attacked customers with a weapon? Just because they&apos;re female doesn&apos;t mean they couldn&apos;t do damage to him, or that they didn&apos;t have a gun, knife or other weapon.
 
The general consensus seems to agree: they got what they deserved
 
Live by the sword, die by the sword. You pull this tough guy/girl shit long enough and someone is going to call you on it. He was trying to do his job, and they got lippy and fucked with the wrong dude. So be it.
 
&lt;i&gt;What if those attackers were males and the defender was a female? Would themedia still publicize this bias against him?&lt;/i&gt;Nope.
 
You&apos;re a fucking idiot. What if they battered you or someone you cared about?&quot;Don&apos;t hit women no matter what&quot;is usually said by spoiled rotten women who think their shit doesn&apos;t stink and that men should love them no matter how bad they act. I have news for you women:the only guys that are going to want you no matter how bad you abuse them only exist in fiction. We won&apos;t take it in real life. Well,real men won,t take your shit.
 
If they are forced to go back to crime we can always give them Tim Bates address and the addresses of everyone who agrees with him.
 
All three of them? Do you miss your brain?
 
&lt;i&gt;real men dont hit women&lt;/i&gt;Okay then real women don&apos;t hit men. It goes for both or neither.
 
America is a pussy whipped country with two types of women in it: those with penises and those without. Real men such as myself are a minority.
 
If you have no problem with them getting up and getting the upper hand on you then you deserve what you get.
 
Let me tell you something,KC. I would rather be judged by twelve than carried by six.
 
&lt;i&gt;Clearly, some people don&apos;t comprehend the definition of&quot;Self Defense.&quot;&quot;Generally a person may use reasonable force when it appears reasonably necessary to prevent an impending injury. A person using force in self-defense should use only so much force as is required to repel the attack.&quot;&quot;A person who is the initial aggressor in a physical encounter may be able to claim self-defense if the tables turn in the course of the fight. Generally a person who was the aggressor may use nondeadly force if the victim resumes fighting after the original fight ended. If the original aggressor attacked with nondeadly force and was met with deadly force in return, the aggressor may respond with deadly force.&quot;-&lt;/i&gt;What law book did you get this out of?
 
They started it. He didn&apos;t do shit except his job.
 
&lt;i&gt;It is sad what happen to the lady&apos;s, but I&apos;m sure they will think twice about there action when and if they step into another fast food restaurant.&lt;/i&gt;They asked for it. 

Don&apos;t be a mangina douche you&apos;ll only end up pissing off the real men such as myself.
 
What would you do,supergay? Allow them to beat you? You probably get off on that. Faggot.
 
This is the same CBS that has the talk on it. On that show they make fun of men  who are sexually mutilated by women. This shows where CBS&apos;s biases are too.
 
You had me on your side until you called the two women&quot;chimpanzees.&quot;Whether you knew it or not; that was a racist comment and unwarranted in this circumstance.

With that being said; the rest of your comment is spot-on.

Carry on, trooper.
 
These two bitches are probably regulars that is why they have the metal rod.
 
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;m thinking , did they get what they ordered ?&lt;/i&gt;If they ordered whupass they did.
 
Excellent point,bigoka.
 
&lt;i&gt;I don&apos;t think his was rite for beating her but she had no right slapping n jumping over the counter to fight.. Who are we to judge how a person protects them selves?&lt;/i&gt;You just did,hyprocrite. But I guess holding women accountable in femerica is verbotten.
 
That&apos;s because they probably have the same fucked up attitude these two bitches have and they&apos;re pissed they are being stood up to.
 
He could have been dead by the time the police showed up if he listened to Tim Bates and the other idiots who agree with him.
 
Only women resort to that tactic but to answer your question you&apos;ll always be the little man of the board.
 
Are you one of the women featured in story or the bigmouth blonde at the end? Don&apos;t start shit and you don&apos;t have to worry about an assbeating. It&apos;s that simple.
 
You&apos;re just some self-righteous prick bigmouth who lives a sheltered life and doesn&apos;t have to worry about anything because mommy supplies everything.
 
She was trying to get up and possibly come after him. If I was him I wouldn&apos;t gamble with my life by letting her back up and possibly kill me. If you are suicidal that is on you.
 
So you have no problem with someone laying their hands on you and then getting up to possibly hurt you some more? As long as they have a vagina,is that right? Yes? Another obit listing. They sure are adding up.
 
Yet there will find excuses for women like Casey Anthony and Lorena Bobbit.
 
So you have no problem with an assailant getting the upper hand on you and injuring you further?
 
When you fuck up Tim let&apos;s all hold it against you forever. Let&apos;s lord it over your head forever. We can do that considering a self-righteous prick like yourself probably walks on water while looking down on everyone else.
 
I think you mean&quot;parent&quot;as in a fatass single mom who watches Oprah all day.
 
Tim Bates,

Why are you using this against him when he did his time yet excuse the women who strarted this?

If you are concerned about children how do feel about Casey Anthony?
 
People are scared to piss off team vagina which makes them bigger pussies,just like Tim Bates.
 
Bravo.
 
No,but women like you are.
 
Seconded.
 
Does your boyfriend agree with you?
 
So you would allow them to get back up and come at you again? Like I told the other idiot see you in the obits.
 
Robert Sietsema and those like him are manginas that will excuse a woman for anything and if they can pin it on the nearest available man they will do so.
 
Robert Sietsema aka Tim Bates.
 
If you saw the version I saw one of the assailants was wearing a baseball cap and it is difficult to tell if it was a woman. If I couldn&apos;t tell and I have the luxury of replaying the clip how is he supposed to know. Even if it is a woman women aren&apos;t harmless. The graveyard is filled with men who didn&apos;t grasp that  concept.
 
Not Tim Bates he would have probably grovelled at their feet. That is what his type usually does.
 
The mainstream media has to blame the man for everything. Even if he&apos;s the victim they will blame him. It&apos;s either that or piss off feminists and they would rather pee in their pants than do the latter.
 
&lt;i&gt;Tim Bates you are a retard. If you would have been working behind the counter, those two women would have beat your ass, and you would have cried like a baby&lt;/i&gt;Sounds like a Tim Bates fantasy.
 
Women get a pussy pass in this country. Everyone is afraid to hold women accountable because they are afraid of the feminists screaching. The people running things are either feminists or manginas/white knights.
 
I&apos;m white and I&apos;m defending him but I&apos;m not some guilty liberal about it.
 
So it&apos;s okay if someone wants to lay their hands on you or someone you care about?
 
Would you allow them to get up? Yes? See you in obits.
 
He was defending himself. If you don&apos;t like that then let people do whatever they want to you. Let them treat you anyway they feel like,even lay hands on you,since you don&apos;t believe in self-defense.
 
If you were in that situation what would you do?  

It&apos;s easy to take a mangina position and assign blame to the man in all situations. In fact it is so easy a coward can do it.
 
If it
was my business, and if I had a gun in my possession, I would have pulled out
my gun and shoot those 2 as you never know what will happen to you. 



This country is the land of free, and he has his
constitutional rights to defend himself when he is attacked and threatened at a
private work SPACE. 



plus the only reason for the continued hitting was
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET BACK UP,
WHILE HE WAS TELLING THEM TO STAY DOWN.



Those 2 women had no right to attacked him, swear
at him and invaded his PRIVATE SPACE. They have threatened him, slapped him,
attacked the man went over the couter in the intention of harming him. When a
man or women is attacked at a private work space, you have every right to defend
yourself and keep the space safe.



This extreme media bias against him is totally out
of controlled just because he was a former criminal. What would happen if those
2 were armed and dangerous? Would you still say he deserved this bad publicity?
What if those attackers were males and the defender was a female? Would the
media still publicize this bias against him? What if he was never charged with
crime? Would he still be the attacker?  



This sorry ass dude is already sorry for what he
did, and doing the right thing working at MCDs. I bet this is the best job he
can ever get with his back ground history. The dude made a big mistake in high
school days like all other teenagers make mistakes. He took it to an extreme
level; nevertheless, I am not defending the heinous crime that he made
previously; however, I bet he had, has and will always regret what he had done
as he had to serve in prison over a decade when his friends went to college and
have family now. 



I bet he knew things that he knows now; he would
have never made the same crime back. Thus, he tried to contribute back to the
community by paying taxes and working hard&amp;put himself together to join
back to the society getting paid minimum wage even though he could have become
a drug dealer or robber to make quick money like most of other criminals do
when they get out of prison. What if these 2 people have attacked you at your
work place and You fortunately was able to nail the 2 suckers but they tried to
get up. Would you still beat them or would you let them get up and potentially
harm you? If he was a bank clerked, those 2 were to be shot at on site.



Now MCD fired him. They have no right to do that
because he was just defending himself. Wouldn’t you be angry if you were fired
and imprisoned even though you were defending yourself? It is MCDs job to
provide secure working environment, and it is their job to protect their
employees. Instead, they had to fire him and criminalized him without questioning
him. MCDs should get totally sued as. 



What if you were slapped. What if you were
threatened? What if someone went over the counter and pose a threat? Wouldn’t
you fight back? 



He is victim here, not a criminal. Set this man
free and MCDs should totally pay him for firing him. He deserves better
than this and he deserves 2nd chance.
 
They slapped him in the face and put the other employees at risk when they broke the boundary line and entered the kitchen/cashier area, that warrants beating the hell out of those idiots. What if they had a knife? They were in the wrong. He defended himself.
 
That isn&apos;t assault that&apos;s self defense. I hope he sues McDonalds, and those sick fat disgusting low life&apos;s.
 
&quot;Clearly, McDonald&apos;s doesn&apos;t do much of a background check on its employees.&quot;Apparently, dimwit reporter Robert Sietsema believes ex-criminals should not hold jobs.  Maybe we can send them to his place for a handout.
