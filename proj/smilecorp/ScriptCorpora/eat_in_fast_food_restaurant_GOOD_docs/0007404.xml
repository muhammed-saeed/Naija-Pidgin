 Former Franchise Owner 

Hi, my name is John Salvo. I have worked since I was 16 and got my driver’s license. My first job was at a fast food restaurant, making $3 or $4 an hour—whatever minimum wage was at the time. It was hard work, but I had fun because my friends worked there. It seemed like a good business to be in. The customers just walked in the door or drove up to the drive-thru window. The restaurant was near a beach so it did especially well in the summertime. Sometimes we had lines out the door!

I graduated from high school and went two hours north to a state university. I decided to major in business because that would prepare me for anything. I worked at various places throughout college, including the university bookstore. I got my Bachelors, then my Masters. Earning an MBA had always been a goal of mine.

It was the early 90s when I finally started looking for my first full-time job. And I had no problem finding a job with a local bank. The pay was OK—$40K to start—but I moved up quickly into a Junior Loan Officer position for $50K. One year later, I was offered a position at a bigger bank as Loan Officer and was making $65K. Two years after that, I was promoted to Senior Corporate Loan Officer and received a salary increase to $75K.

I always worked hard at my job, and had really good hours (no weekends, no holidays). I took advantage of the 401K by maxing out at 15% of my income, which grew quickly because of the generous company match. My Dad insisted that renting was a waste of money and that I buy a house—so I did that, too. I bought a 3-bedroom, 2-bath home—it even had a swimming pool and a small, fenced-in yard. I rented out the other two rooms to help make the house payment.

Career Alternative?

In 1993, I decided I could make even more money by buying homes, fixing them up, and flipping them, so I did that also. Some I kept and rented out. Others, I made anywhere from $10K to $40K on when I sold them! I invested the money so it would make a good return.

That same year I was at a Super Bowl party at one of my co-worker’s houses. There was a very attractive and friendly woman I couldn’t help but notice. So I struck up a conversation with her. It turned out that she was waitressing part-time while getting her degree in education. She graduated in 1997 and got a job teaching kindergarten for the local school district. Her pay was low—$30K a year—but the benefits were good.

In 1998, we married and I kicked my roommates out. By that time, I had moved to another bank—a big international bank (if I said the name everyone would recognize it immediately—it’s still going strong today). I had also received a big raise, too, so I was up to $85K a year. With my wife’s income, we were bringing home $115K. In the late 90s, that seemed pretty good. We didn’t have a lot of expenses, just the house payment, and she was socking away 15% of her income, too, with a really good match from the school district.

Within five years, we had savings (including our retirement accounts) of $300K. We also had a significant amount of equity in our house, and with our real estate holdings we were worth $1.5 million altogether. We had no credit card debt and were driving old beater cars. By this time, my son and daughter had been born—Connor was three and Stella was five months old.

New Career–Franchise

I started thinking about the future. I noticed the bank was outsourcing a lot of positions to either foreigners on work visas or overseas. I felt relatively safe as a loan officer. I was producing revenue, but it had started to worry me. If I didn’t have my income from the bank, we’d be sunk. What could I do to make sure my family was provided for? Something I could start that could run itself and provide an income for life? I was tired of the corporate rat race, too. I wanted to own my own business—it was something I’d always wanted to do. But what kind of business?

I thought back to when I was a teenager and I worked at a fast food restaurant. It seemed like the perfect solution! Owning a fast food franchise was the answer. As I said before, I had a net worth of $1.5 million, between the equity in my house, my retirement savings, etc. But I thought of how I wanted my wife to be home with the kids and to assure their financial futures as well.

So I researched it. McDonald’s franchises were already locked up. I focused on other fast food franchises and finally settled on one that would give me a local territory. I quit my job so I could pour all of my energies into getting the business up and running.

 How could you fail at a fast food franchise? At least that’s what I told my wife and friends! So even though it took a lot of my capital—and the bank’s—to get started, I went ahead and signed a 20-year agreement and paid the franchise fee. Don’t worry, it’ll pay off in the end , I said.

Because I didn’t want to tap my real estate investments, I kept using my liquid capital, and I borrowed a large sum of money to get started—a conventional bank loan and a home equity loan. At the time, my home value had appreciated to the point where I had plenty of that.

I then put start-up money into building a restaurant on an outparcel of a shopping center. I had to pay for the land and the construction. With it all came a flood of paperwork. Permits, insurance, licenses . . . and more fees.  It was more expensive than building a house! Then, of course, I had to lay out more cash for equipment and inventory.

As the completion date got nearer, I had to think about hiring employees. I put an ad in the local newspaper and started conducting interviews in a nearby coffee house. The staffing needs were overwhelming—I needed at least three people in the store at all times, and many times more than that between the cooking staff and the counter and drive-through staff.

And then there was purchasing the inventory—and the utilities to make sure that inventory stayed fresh until it was time to open the business. I had also paid my own traveling expenses for the franchise training. So many expenses . . . and all of them necessary to get the doors open.

It got so I didn’t want to look at the numbers. I had my wife keep track of everything on a spreadsheet. She was still working her teaching job and helping me on the weekends when she could. She also had to look after Connor and Stella because I wasn’t there to do it. I was always either gone or preoccupied with getting something done for the business.

Opening Day!

As the big day approached, I had to start advertising the opening. I had signs made up and I ran ads in the local newspaper and coupon guides . . . All of which cost more money.

By the time I finally opened the doors, I had blown through $2.8 million. My home equity was completely tapped, and my savings accounts were depleted. We had only our retirement accounts left untouched.

Well, I thought, now that the doors are open, the money will start coming in.

And it did. But not nearly as quickly as I needed it to! I had invested so much in getting the restaurant open, plus paying my family’s living expenses while I was working on it, and now I had to take the revenue we were finally getting and start trying to recoup the cost. It wasn’t going to be easy. The vast majority of every dollar that came in was eaten up utilities, inventory, staff (the minimum wage was significantly more than I remembered), taxes, etc.

What I discovered, too, was that it doesn’t matter if you are eking out a profit or swimming in red ink. Franchisees are required to pay royalties on gross sales, no matter what.

And it wasn’t just that. The recession hit us early. In our area, we started seeing things slow down in May 2005. You would think fast food would still have been going strong, but for us sales dropped a lot, and they dropped suddenly—19%, in fact, in the first 30 days. Now, I still had all the same expenses. The same employees, the same inventory, the same utilities, and the same royalties to pay. I thought about cutting back, but then again I had to be ready if and when the customers got there.

Then another fast food chain restaurant opened up a block away, on the opposite side of the road. I had seen the building going up, but I was hoping it was a bank. It wasn’t until they got closer to opening that I knew it would be a direct competitor. That was something I hadn’t anticipated. My franchisor limited the number of stores in a particular territory, but other chains? They were under no such requirement. And I saw an immediate and noticeable decrease in my sales the day they opened their doors.

All the while, I kept calling corporate for guidance and direction. Instead, I was put on hold for 30 minutes at a time, or I got someone who didn’t have a clue as to how to help me. I finally realized all the company cared about was making more franchise sales and royalties, regardless of the cost to existing franchisees. Oh, and of course, making Wall Street happy.

Every month that went by, I was paying exorbitant advertising fees and, of course, royalties. And corporate would come up with strategies that we would have to implement that made things even worse for us.  For example, they would lower costs on key items as a “loss leader” to bring more customers in through the doors. I was selling some things at below cost! But corporate didn’t care, because they made a profit twice. First, for the gross sales of their franchisees, and second, off the stock price for what looks like increased sales. Problem is, the franchisor doesn’t pay the expenses on those increased sales—franchisees do!

I guess I had forgotten, too, how hard restaurant work is. That was one thing, though, I had been somewhat prepared for from my previous experience working in a fast food restaurant. But what I discovered was that owning the restaurant was entirely different!

Trading Time for Money

I was working very long hours—80 to 90 a week. I would be on my feet sometimes for 16 hours a day! While I really needed to focus on the profitability aspect of running the business, I was instead kept busy with personnel issues. We had either high school kids (not too many) or people who just could not cut it in the corporate world for one reason or another. And that was precisely why I had trouble all the time. Many times they just would not show up for work, were late, or had problems with other staff members. I had no choice—I had to fill in myself if help was needed.

It was about this time I realized through sales projections that the first few years—even up to five years or more—would not be very profitable. That’s because we were busy trying to recoup the initial investment. And with profit margins being cut by management mandates on pricing, this was a very hard feat to pull off. I figured I was losing money on 25% of my orders—meaning it took another good percentage of orders just to make up that loss.

And as the recession wore on, it got even harder. You see, I had a great location—at least in 2004 and 2005. Since that time, the area has been hit hard. We had a lot of construction and manufacturing guys in the area. Many of them were laid off. They spent months and months unemployed—and then finally packed up their families and left the area for greener pastures. Soon, every fifth house looked abandoned: lawns overgrown with weeds, pools turned green with neglect. Fewer families meant less business for my restaurant. I thought that surely this would last only a year.

A year passed—it did not get any better. In fact, it grew worse. More families left; more people were unemployed. People were looking to save a buck anywhere they could. It just kept going on and on—and getting worse and worse—and I grew more and more desperate.

This was not what I had planned on. Truly, I had thought I could hire a manager and just breeze in every now and then to make sure the fries were hot. But I didn’t want to pay yet another salary for yet another employee who might or might not work out. I wanted to see firsthand how things were going.

All the while, I still had to pay the franchisor their fees. Whether I made money or not, those fees came due. So did the utility bills, the inventory bills, the payroll, the supply expenses—it went on and on. I was drowning in costs! I cashed in our 401Ks (the money I had promised myself I would not touch) just to keep it going. I sold off my real estate—at lower than market rate—because I needed the money. I had put so much into trying to make this restaurant work that I thought I had to give it everything I had, every chance to make it.

One day I suddenly realized that I was on a sinking ship. I had to get out. It didn’t matter that I had sunk my life savings into this restaurant. I had to get out for my sanity—and for any shred of a financial future I might have left. Every day I spent trying to work at it was a day wasted.

I contacted the franchisor and I let them know I wanted out. I remember the manager I talked to—someone I had met years before. We’d had a good relationship then, but now I could sense his irritation with me. He must be receiving a lot of these phone calls, I thought.

“Well, John,” he said, “I’m sorry to hear that. You know here at corporate we are doing everything we can to help the franchisees. We revamped our advertising. We changed up the menu. We’re doing all we can for you.” I seethed inside. How about lowering your fees, I thought. Or waving them for a while? Or providing a lower cost inventory? I said as much to him. He paused, as if considering what to say. “Well, John,” he started again, “I’m not in a position to change company policy.”

That was basically it. Every time I called—which got to be on a weekly basis—it was “We’re doing everything we can, John. Just hang in there.” And “We can’t go changing company policy now, can we?” Basically, it confirmed my feeling that if corporate was making money and the stockholders were happy—they really didn’t care what the franchisees thought. I was getting so angry and frustrated that I was turning into a person I didn’t recognize. My temper was short with my wife, I was snapping at the kids all the time.

A few months later, I was at the end of my rope. I threatened to walk away from the business, declare bankruptcy . . . that was it. Management was very quick to point out to me that I still owed them fees; we had a contract. “Screw the contract.” I said. “I just want out. You can sue me if you want to, but if I’m declaring bankruptcy, there’s nothing left for you to come after!” I promptly hung up on them. Later I marveled at my behavior on the phone call. What had I become?

Well, at least it got someone’s attention. I had a call back from a VP! At last. He admitted to me that franchisees were up in arms all over the company. He said that they really didn’t want controversy—after all, there were the stock holders to think about (Screw the stockholders! I was thinking). But there was going to be an initiative to buy some franchisees back, he told me. They wanted to revamp the restaurants and turn them around. Did I want to be put on the list as a possible buy back? Heck, yes, I said, in a nanosecond.

For some reason that allowed me to start thinking about the future. I was still getting up early, going into work every day, and running the restaurant, but it was as if a burden had been lifted. The blinders were off. It was time to decide what to do next.

I didn’t want to run another franchise—or any brick-and-mortar business for that matter. Maybe I should go back to a corporate job, I thought. But I didn’t want to do that either. The more I thought about it, the more I knew I was done taking orders as an employee—or a franchisee, for that matter!

Enter…Experience Mapping

At a fourth of July backyard barbeque a few months later, one of my wife’s friend’s husbands I knew from past social occasions struck up a conversation with me. We got onto the subject of owning your own business, and I relayed my franchise nightmare stories and how I was ready for a change, but I just wasn’t sure what that change should be. He recommended a book. It was Experience Mapping . I went on Amazon.com and ordered it that very night. And when it arrived, I sat down and read it from cover to cover in one sitting.

This was it! I thought. This was the answer!

I had never even thought of running an Internet business. For some reason, I always thought I’d need to study computer programming or something to be able to work through the Internet. But that was not the case. I realized I had all the skills I needed to do it—and do it well. I remembered how I felt when I was in training for the franchise. It seemed like I would never learn or remember everything I needed to know—but I did. The book Experience Mapping showed me that if I had done that , I could do Internet marketing. It turned out that Internet marketing was MUCH simpler to learn. It’s amazing, but I would have never even known about it or pursued it if it weren’t for Experience Mapping !

And all of those endless employee issues I had experienced. I learned negotiation, people skills, motivation—everything I needed to know about leadership and building a successful team. It was no problem for me! Years of overcoming continual personal problems meant people skills were a breeze.

The Experience Mapping™ process also showed me that my sales and marketing skills were top notch. I knew how to bring customers in the door—only this time, I could control my costs. I had an instant profit margin! There was no matrix of costs to figure out—I found it to be pretty simple. And after dealing with customers face to face during my time manning the register when we were short handed, talking to them on the phone or through Skype was no big deal.

So I started my Internet marketing business part time while I still owned the franchise. Do you know that it took me only one month to re-coup my start-up costs? Amazing!

Finally, corporate bought out my franchise about a year ago. My wife ran the numbers—we came just short of breaking even on it. Fine with me, I thought, I just want to be done with it.

And today I am happier than ever. My income is better than it was before—and I get to keep all the profits! No corporate office is telling me what to do. If I need to lower—or raise—prices, I am free to do so. I am in control!

Best of all, I am home.  I get to spend quality time with my kids and my wife. When she goes off to school in the morning, I watch the kids. I work my schedule around the soccer games and the dance recitals.

My life is finally my own, and I have Experience Mapping to thank for it! Thanks Karen, you’ll never know how much I appreciate it. As far as I am concerned, everyone who is unsatisfied with his or her career—or even his or her life—needs to read this book.
