 How Mystery Shopping Works: 
 
 A business hires a mystery shopping company to evaluate their services; and the mystery shopping company, in turn, hires shoppers to perform those evaluations. Shoppers are given a list of things to evaluate/note during the shop. This may include: 

 how long it takes to be greeted speed of service cleanliness of the location compliance with company standards – dress code, signage, greetings, etc. listening for specific services to be offered names/descriptions of employees 

 After completing a shop, the shopper submits her evaluation and receipts. Payment is made one to eight weeks after submission of a successful shop. 

 What Types of Businesses Use Mystery Shoppers: 

 restaurants hotels and resorts retail stores hypermarkets stores movie theatres car showrooms amusement parks petrol stations call centres telco outlets/branches .....and many others 

 How to Avoid Scams: 

 Unfortunately, not all mystery shopping companies are reputable. To avoid falling for a scam, you should avoid any company that: 

 requires you to pay a fee – you shouldn&apos;t have to pay anything to get assignments advertises for shoppers in newspaper help-wanted sections or through unsolicited e-mails requires you to pay for and earn a shopper certification guarantees you shops or a set income 

 For even more protection against scams, look for companies that belong to the Mystery Shopper Providers Association (mysteryshop.org) of which Customereyes International is a Member for MSPA Asia-Pacific. 

 What the Typical Mystery Shop Entails: 

 Every mystery shop assignment is a bit different, but most assignments will require you to complete your shop on a specific day and time. It will also require you to listen for certain services to be offered; to ask specific questions and remember the answers you receive to those questions; and to note the details of your surroundings – everything from the cleanliness of the bathrooms to whether signage is placed appropriately. It may even require you to try out specific services (say a new burger at a fast food restaurant); to take photos of the location; or to record conversations that you have with employees. 

 How Much Mystery Shopping Pays: 

 Mystery shopping is not a way to get rich, nor is it a full-time job. Expect to make RM20-50 per shop in addition to any merchandise or services that you receive during the course of the shop. A typical restaurant shop, for example, might result in a free meal plus a small shop fee for your time. 

 What It Takes to Be a Good Mystery Shopper: 

 attention to detail and always check and recheck before you submit your shop report a good memory objective evaluation skills (meaning…focus on the areas to check and not get distracted by anything) the ability to perform and submit shops promptly, and have the common courtesy to inform the company 

 if you face any difficulties. 

 Tips for Success: 

 Don&apos;t accept a shop unless you are sure that you can complete it. Many companies will remove you from 

 their list of shoppers after just one failed shop or inaccurate/doubtful information. 

 Be willing to accept last-minute and less-than-glamourous shops when starting out – this will improve 

 your standing with the company 

 Read over the requirements of a mystery shop several times before attempting the shop. If you miss 

 some of the details, you won&apos;t be paid. 

 If you are not and have some questions about conducting a particular shop visit, call the company and 

 ASK! 

 Starting Out with a Mystery Shopping Company:

 When starting out with a new mystery shopping company, there are several things that you can do to ensure that the relationship is a good one. This includes: 

 Starting with a shop with no or low out-of-pocket expenses Waiting to receive payment from your first shop, before taking on additional shops Evaluating whether you are being fairly compensated for your time. RM30 may sound like a fair payment 

 until you discover you&apos;re spending five hours on each shop 

 Evaluating how easy to use and reliable the site is. If the tools are difficult to use, you may find your 

 earnings doesn&apos;t justify the hassle
