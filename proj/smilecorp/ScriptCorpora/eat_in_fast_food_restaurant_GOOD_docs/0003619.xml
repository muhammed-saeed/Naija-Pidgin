 Grabbing a seat at the diners of yesteryear 

 By John Lagoulis The Daily News of Newburyport Wed Oct 05, 2011, 03:48 AM EDT 
 

In the early 1900s, specifically the 1920s and even the 1930s, eating out in a diner was a way of life for many people. Many working people did not eat at home for various reasons. Let me tell you, dear readers, why it was so.

The population in the country was building up very fast during the early 1900s. Kitchens in homes did not have any of the conveniences and appliances we know today; kitchen appliances came along much later. So the answer to that was easy; go out to a diner.

Newburyport and its surrounding areas were famous for their diners. They were convenient and sort of like the fast-food restaurant of today. They could serve a customer fast and handle the necessary demand. Time allotted for lunch for the working class was the acceptable half hour in those days. Therefore, a quick lunch at a diner was the answer.

Diners were here, there and everywhere. The food was always good and the prices were reasonable.

There was always a diner at a trolley car stop. People would eat there while waiting for the trolley car. When getting off the trolleys, people would also frequent the nearest diner. The diners and the public trolley cars seemed to work in synchronization.

Some of the diners were drawn by one or two horses. These mobile diners could follow the people from corner to corner and street to street throughout cities and towns. They opened from the sides, which lifted up and out, and the people could walk in with one step and be sitting on a stool and eating their lunch in a flash and be back to their workplace in less than a half hour. (There was no such thing as overtime in those days, by the way.) These mobile diners served the population well and kept them very busy.

Mrs. Hicks&apos; two diners were stationed in Market Square. One, a portable diner more like a pie wagon, was on Water Street at Market Square; the other on Liberty Street at Market Square. They specialized in wonderful, tasty pastries, pies and hot-cross buns in addition to good food.

All the diners would attract you with their unique construction and attractive colors, lights and names. For example, Mr. Welch&apos;s stationary diner in Market Square at the corner of Liberty and State streets, where Starbucks is today, was painted bright green. Mr. Welch had several diners. He had a horse-drawn diner that he took from place to place in the early 1920s. He had another stationary diner in Market Square next to where the Salvation Army played its beautiful music.

Mr. Hermie Rich had a couple of diners. One was at the Route 1 traffic circle approximately where the Newburyport District Court is today. His diners were very elegant and colorful, just as he was. He would welcome all his customers, engaging in a conversation with anyone willing to talk. He had a good personality, was always so polite and always had a smile.

He invented the idea of putting two diners together. He ordered the construction of two diners and requested they be put together and delivered to the traffic circle as one. The diner was painted bright red with big, gold letters that said Rich&apos;s. Whenever I had reason to go there, I really enjoyed having the custard pie and ice cream. It was very delicious ... my favorite.

Mr. Rich&apos;s diner was very appealing; however, he was facing the unknown. His diner eventually was a victim of the Depression and had to close down. The people missed his smiles and pleasantness, while I missed the custard pie and ice cream.

The diners also had very likable names. For instance, The Flying Yankee Diner was next to the train depot on Winter Street. Its construction had the likeness of a train&apos;s car. It was open 24 hours a day, because trains were coming and going all day and night bringing people to the city.

John Donahue&apos;s Diner was on the corner of Green and Pleasant streets where the post office is today. In the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered all new post offices be built across the nation, Donahue&apos;s Diner was removed and replaced with a new post office.

John Donahue, with his son, John Jr., moved his diner one door down from the corner of Inn and Pleasant streets, very close to where The Daily News was then produced. His diner was open until late in the evenings. I visited this diner approximately two or three times. I would order a Moxie tonic for 5 cents. One early Saturday night, I went in and didn&apos;t know what to order. The son, who was a friend of mine, suggested he give me a large hamburger, which normally cost 10 cents, for only 5 cents as a friendly gesture. I accepted. He mentioned something about the refrigeration had no ice that night and they would not have ice until Monday, so he was selling the food cheaper. But he neglected to tell me the meat was already spoiled. Well, I&apos;ll tell you, I was one very sick little boy for at least two days or more due to stomach poisoning. I stayed away from Donahue&apos;s Diner and never went back after that. Coincidentally, he went out of business shortly after that.

In Market Square, we had Lyon&apos;s Lunch Diner. It was a busy little place. It had only stools to sit on. Their specialty, a favorite of all, was baked beans and a hot dog for 20 cents. If you wanted coffee, it was an additional 5 cents. It was a good meal.

There were also diners on the highways leading into and out of the Port area. For instance, there was The Agawam Diner. The name came from the Agawam Indians who lived in the area. In 1924, my father took me to visit the Agawam Diner because he was friendly with the owners. I enjoyed the huge lemon meringue pie with ice cream, of course. It was so huge I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes and it cost only 10 cents for the pie and a nickel for a large scoop of ice cream. (That was the price everywhere.) They had a reputation for baking their own mountain-high pies. The Agawam has survived and is still in business today.

There&apos;s also a diner today on Ring&apos;s Island in Salisbury next to Ring&apos;s Island Marina along the waterfront. It&apos;s called the Fish Tale Diner and offers indoor seating as well as outdoor seating on a patio with a lovely view of Newburyport.

Did you know Bossy Gillis also built and owned a diner on Route 1 in Salisbury? It was located on Bridge Road in the marsh on the right-hand side before you reach Salisbury Square. It was red, white and blue. Bossy was a popular mayor of Newburyport and a popular man with a popular diner, which was busy all night long.

Another popular diner was Jack Kelleher&apos;s Diner in Market Square on the north side, next to the fire station. Kelleher ran it all by himself. He later became mayor of Newburyport. Much later, he opened an ice cream stand at the three roads intersection at Storey Avenue. It is still there today, but it appears they sell more spaghetti and pizza and less ice cream.

Ruth&apos;s Diner was directly across from Ruth Shoe Company on Merrimac Street. The workers from the shoe factory would often get their lunch there. It was more or less a day diner. It was demolished by the federal bulldozers when they came to town.

The Central Lunch Diner was at Salisbury Beach on Broadway next to Willey&apos;s Candies right in the center. It was a very busy place and very successful. I should know. I worked there for eight years, while attending Newburyport High School and during the Depression. I was the assistant cook and chief bottle washer.

Salisbury Diner was also located in the beach center on the corner of Route 1A, heading north toward Hampton, N.H. Later, they put a roller skating rink there; after that, a restaurant.

One of the beginnings of the downfall of diners was the opening of luncheonettes. A diner is separate and functions by itself and can be moved, whereas a luncheonette is part of a building and cannot be moved.

Luncheonettes appeared in the 1930s. For example, we had department stores such as Woolworth Co., S.S. Kresge Co. and J.J. Newbury&apos;s, all located on Pleasant Street. Each offered a luncheonette. People liked the luncheonette because it was a combination of a department store and diner and because they sat on stools at a counter. The ladies enjoyed a morning coffee or a sandwich and such while shopping and meeting their friends there. My mother would go to J.J. Newbury&apos;s every morning.

In addition to operating in large department stores, luncheonettes later opened up independently on various side streets throughout the city. I recall a popular luncheonette on Middle Street next to the Salvation Army, where The Grog restaurant is today. It was known as Spud Leary&apos;s Lunch. There, one could always get a cup of coffee, a plate of fried potatoes with a slice of bread and butter and a glass of beer combined with a great conversation (he was always ready with a great conversation), all for less than 25 cents!

However, many of the original diners of the 1920s and &apos;30s continued to operate along with the luncheonettes. However, a change was coming. The years during World War II damaged the business of diners everywhere, and changed the face of dining.

Dear readers, let me tell you about my favorite diner of all. A relative of mine had purchased a diner in Haverhill. I remember visiting it with my parents on two occasions. It was the first time I could see a diner when approaching from a distance due to its bright lights. That diner was later purchased and brought over to Salisbury and placed in Salisbury Square where it still is today.

It is known today as Pat&apos;s Diner. In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful diners of its time. It is now operated by Pat (Poulakos) Archambault, a friend of mine. That&apos;s where I enjoy my breakfast and lunch often. I think I&apos;m addicted to the eggs, sausages, home fries, toast and coffee. It&apos;s enjoyable dining there. Let me tell you why.

The diner was popular with the servicemen in World War II. When World War II broke out, the government brought the U.S. 1st Army Division with a big, red, number 1 on their shoulder patch to Fort Devens. Fort Devens was breaking at the seams with soldiers, especially with the famous Indian Division waiting to go to Europe. While waiting, they would go to the Laconia Lunch. That&apos;s where Pat became a restaurant owner before opening Pat&apos;s Diner in Salisbury Square. Pat will proudly tell you the story about the soldiers in Europe who had a saying in their foxhole: &quot;Every man in a foxhole in Europe has first passed through the Laconia Lunch.&quot;

I also enjoy Pat&apos;s Diner very much because it brings back wonderful memories. In one part of her diner, she still has a room that features memorabilia from the 1930s. She even has an original jukebox machine where one can drop in coins and play music of the 1930s and even some from the 1920s. She has nostalgic photos displayed from that period, images of Frank Sinatra and his entire group, known as the Rat Pack; Elvis Presley, Patti Page, Helen O&apos;Connell and The Andrews Sisters.

Yes, Pat&apos;s Diner shows some wear and tear on the outside from the past years; however, it&apos;s still my favorite and brings back my almost 100 years of diner memories. It&apos;s as though you&apos;ve stepped back in time. It&apos;s one of our few diners that still exist and you get to see a bit of old Americana and experience sweet nostalgia.

Have you eaten in a local diner lately? Give it a try. You&apos;ll enjoy it. There&apos;s nothing finer than a diner!
