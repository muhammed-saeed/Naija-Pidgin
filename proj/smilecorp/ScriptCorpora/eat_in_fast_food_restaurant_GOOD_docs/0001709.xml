Listen -- this looks like the type of place you would go to buy some sort of contraband.

Alas, it&apos;s quite the opposite. Don&apos;t let the flimsy sketchy outside scare you away. Just kind of embrace it, or ignore it. Either way works, as long as you get inside and give it a shot.

The first thing I noticed was how insanely cheap the food was. The most expensive item on the menu is $5.50, which is three entrees (two solids and some rice). A total steal in a place like Waikiki.

Then I delved into my meal and was greeted by a surprising wave of flavor. The whole shabang (lo-mein, sweet and sour chicken and rice) was delicious. Very impressive, again, given the location and appeal of the location.

I wouldn&apos;t consider this a first-date type of place, but in a pinch as a college student, this place is the tops.

Foreword: It&apos;s a BYOB deal. Grab a six-pack and dish it up with some buddies.

Fatty&apos;s Chinese Fast Food is a small, hole-in-the-wall Cantonese place in the back of the International Marketplace off of Kuhio Avenue.  Despite having heard of this place numerous times and passing by it a bunch of times, the fiancee and I had never tried it.  Every time we stayed in Waikiki, we always opted to stick with just Marukame Udon, Il Lupino, Sansei, Arancino Di Mare, and Kimo Bean Coffee.  This time, however, we were determined to give Fatty&apos;s a try.

The fiancee were staying at the Courtyard by Marriott Waikiki Beach just a few blocks down, so we decided to walk over to Fatty&apos;s and do takeout.  Fatty&apos;s itself is literally a hole in the wall.  There&apos;s a takeout counter and a few bar style seats, that&apos;s it.  The employees also don&apos;t really know how to speak english, which isn&apos;t really an issue for me and can even be seen as a sign of good things to come!

Anyhow, the fiancee and I decided to order off the chef&apos;s recommended specials menu and ended up ordering too much food!  On recommendation from a friend, we ordered the spicy pork&amp;shrimp soup noodle (for the fiancee), a runny egg beef (for me), and a shrimp&amp;choy sum cake noodle (off the menu item to share).  So how was it?  Well, I don&apos;t care for spicy food, so the soup noodle was too spicy for me to really try.  However, the runny egg beef was good, though a little bland.  I was expecting much stronger flavors, so I was actually a little disappointed with this one.  The cake noodle, on the other hand, had lots of flavor, good texture, and the shrimp were perfectly cooked!  In fact, the noodles in the cake noodles were thin and chewy/crispy, different from most others in a good way, as was its flavor.

So is this someplace I&apos;d go back to?  Of course!  Is it something I&apos;d have a strong craving for?  Probably not, but it was still good!  Good, old fashion Cantonese can be difficult to find, and this hit the mark!  And it gets even better when you consider the price (especially for Waikiki).

Nestled in the heart of Waikiki, Fatty&apos;s Chinese Kitchen is located in the ground floor of the Miramar at Waikiki Hotel on Kuhio Avenue. This place offers value priced Cantonese style cuisine serving up noodles and even local favorites such as cold ginger chicken, sweet and sour pork, beef with broccoli and shoyu chicken.

This small yet simple little shop is set up with a single counter bordering the kitchen where you can sit down and dine or watch the busy cooks frying up the dishes in the hot sizzling wok.

With so many menu items to choose from I ended up ordering the sweet and sour pork with steamed hot rice for $4.50. Although the dish looked pleasing to the eye, don&apos;t be fooled because the sweet and sour pork lacked flavor both in the sauce and the pork.

Overall even though I was disappointed in this dish, I would go back and order what I should have ordered in the first place, one of their noodle dishes.

Ahhh yess..its Fatty&apos;s

Basically a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant on Kuhio Blvd. The food is cheap, but good.

Hardly any seats, but if you are by yourself or just want some cheap-O Chinese food, nice quaint spot to go..

Be sure to go early though as they do run out of certain noodles, ( they ran out of Beef chow fun!!!!)..anyways the menu is totally customizable, so you have plenty of choices to choose from

What a hidden gem. This place will definitely be in our regular restaurant rotation when we are hungry in Waikiki. It&apos;s a no frills Chinese restaurant with limited counter space but the service is friendly and if you order from the menu the food is cooked to order right in front of you.

I got the chow fun which were cooked in a super hot wok so that there were a lot of crispy yummy bits  and the husband got Sichuan shrimp on rice.  The shrimp were head on shell on shrimp that we&apos;re fried with garlic and chili peppers and were so freaking good!  It rivals that of the best Chinese restaurants here but for less than $10. Seriously, one of the best deals and fast food in Waikiki.

Cool little walk up and order kinda place that was close to our hotel, the food was good.  The sweet and sour that was pre made was actually the best one, it was good. The beef chow fun was ok, but couldn&apos;t even begin to measure up to ACE here in AZ.

Once again Honolulu&apos;s local cuisine did not disappoint.  The food is wonderful, very authentic Chinese food.  I was lucky enough to spend 17 days in Taiwan and i can tell you that Fatty&apos;s reminded me of the ambiance, smell, taste of Taiwan.  Don&apos;t miss this.  It is located in the back of the International Market.

Make sure you make a trip.  A few seats, hole in the wall place but WORTH it.

I was staying at the Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel for a week and decided to try this place. I&apos;m a sucker for duck. Anyways, I came here to get my fix. I ordered the roasted duck with fried rice. And must have returned every day to order the same thing . It was good! One of the times I decided to have the duck and chicken combo but opted to have the duck alone with fried rice again. Food was reasonably priced and I had no complaints.

This is about as good as it gets for Cantonese food. I was really surprised to find this little gem in Waikiki amongst all the large western restaurants (ie. Cheesecake Factory, which I still don&apos;t understand why people line up for...). Anyways, from my knowledge, this little joint has been around for over 30years and nothing has changed. The food is fantastic, and super authentic w/that wok-flavour you always look for in stir-fried noodles and fried rice (I grew up eating Chinese food, I should know). My favourite dishes have to be the beef brisket noodle soup, beef and choi-sum rice noodle, and salty fish fried rice. They are absolutely delicious. You can watch the family cook in the ten seater bar around the open kitchen. (You can always get take-out if the bar is full.) It&apos;s a great experience, and solid food for an incredibly cheap price. A definite must visit if coming to Waikiki!!

Hawaii is your typical touristy vacation spot where beach front restaurants are typical, but good food is hard to come by. Fatty&apos;s is neither of these things, it is a hole in the wall, non-beach front restaurant with pretty decent food. After many days of disappointing hawaiian island cuisine I was happily surpised by the quality (flavor, portions and value) offered at Fatty&apos;s.

The place is literally no bigger than 3-3 1/2 office cubes. The layout is bar style seating with the food perpared and and served right in front of you. The cooking style is Cantonese (As found in Canton, Hong Kong, and most Chinatown&apos;s across America) performed in a traditional wok over a fire.

I RECOMMEND: Beef chow fun and their fried rice.

Both dishes require actual flame contact with the food to create the correct grilled/burnt flavor. This is accomplished by usage of generous amounts of oil and expertly throwing the noodles or rice with the wok to catch the flame then briefly cooking the noodles or rice that are literally on fire; serves as an impromptu show with your meal.

Last star withheld due to small cramped space and at times the dishes can be a bit oily.

The only problem I have with this place is the dishes are very greasy, but that can be said with the Thai restaurant I went to on Waikiki beach as well. I would say this is a solid Cantonese cafe style restaurant. It&apos;s got everything you&apos;d expect from one of those places in San Francisco Chinatown. We came in to get some stir fried vegetable; my husband said it reminds him of the street food from Thailand. All kinds of people eat here and the kitchen serves up the dish pretty quickly. They&apos;ve got both Americanized Chinese food, Cantonese food and some south east Asian flavor as well. The chef looked Mexican to me, so go figure.

I just came back from Hawaii. Comparing the food to Vancouver, BC, it&apos;s just OK.

I ordered from take-out menu:
Shanghai Noodles - they were OK tasting, but the noodles are not the authentic Shanghai noodles (which are fat wheat noodles).

Chow fun with Beef and Choy Sum - the taste was good but a bit saucier than what I&apos;m used to.

Singapore fried vermicelli - this was good.

Ong Choy and beef on rice - the taste was good but again too saucier than what I&apos;m used to.

I am glad that I read the reviews before going there. There is no place to sit and very hot. Take out is best. I saw some patrons eating there and ordering deep fried prawns. They looked really good. I was in a hurry so didn&apos;t ask if they had a more extensive menu for eat-in.

Overall, the meal was very affordable for Waikiki. I would only go again if I was close by. I wouldn&apos;t make a special trip to this place.

bomb canto food that beats some of the places in California! the shanghai noodles.. beef fried rice.. beef noodles with choy sum and gravy.. omg all soo good. fav woudl have to be the beef noodles with gravy as who can resist fresh noodles. i wish they had some boba milk tea because that wouldve gone quite well with the food. otherwise, just go down a few doors to this snow ice place and have some refreshing dessert :)

the place is small so i would recommend picking it up to go.

Watch them cook um and then you nom nom away. As everyone says: don&apos;t order the premade stuff. Order noodle dishes! Cake noodle! Mmm....crispy goodness. Ok it&apos;s way too early in the morning for me to be writing reviews on yelp*

Anyhow, place is cool because of the size and seating style with the open kitchen. I would come back just to watch the flames.

This place should be the pic&amp;definition of Hole in the Wall&amp;reasonable Chinese for Urban Dictionary&apos;s website.  Nestled in a side alley of Waikiki, mere yards from Kuhio, Fatty&apos;s is where it&apos;s at!

They have bomb arse chow mein.  The sweet sour pork is epic&amp;my fave won ton mein is off the chain.  It&apos;s quick, it&apos;s painless,&amp;cheap.

Great taste + Big portions + Cheap price = Need I say more?

Way overrated. A hole in the wall with 10 seats on a good day and a kitchen that is larger than the customer area. After struggling to make the cashier understand a simple order of &apos;Shrimp Fried Rice&apos; and watching none of the seating customers seem very eager to give up their seats, preferring to sit and chat way after their food is finished, I decided to take my rice back to the hotel and enjoy it in a quieter space.

That&apos;s where the &quot;overrated&quot; terminology came to play, with a dry, uninteresting combination of bland food, void of any flavoring, not even salt. I can see why the locals may like this place as good Chinese food is rather scarce in Honolulu, but this is Waikiki and home to a large tourist client base that has surely had better than average take-out food wherever they call home. My recommendation? Skip this one, unless you absolutely must.

I was shocked to see that I haven&apos;t written a review of Fattys yet.  Maybe I was hoping to keep this place on the down low since it can be hard to find a seat at peak hours.  It&apos;s a small, narrow counter-style restaurant with the kitchen adjacent to the seating.  Yes, it&apos;s small and hot (no a/c) but it&apos;s fun to watch the cooks make your dish right in front of your eyes.

I&apos;ve been going to Fatty&apos;s since I was a little girl vacationing in Waikiki in the 70s.  This place is a true institution.  They serve mostly Cantonese food and it&apos;s all authentic Hong Kong style simple food.

Some words of advice:

1) do not order from the pre-made items behind the glass
2) order noodles or a rice dish from the menu.  my faves: dry fried beef flat noodles (gon chow gnow haw) and roast duck soup noodles (siu gnop tong fun).  Oh, their chicken and salted fish fried rice is also excellent.
3) I&apos;ve also found that the are accommodating enough to let me special order a dish I grew up with in HK-fried rice vermicelli with shredded duck (gon chow gnop see mai fun).  make sure you get it dry (no gravy).

As long as you don&apos;t order the Americanized Chinese food (I can&apos;t vouch for that having never ordered it), you will love it.  Trust me.

I don&apos;t care what anyone says. This place is BOMB-DIGGITY.
Having family from Hong Kong that loves to cook and critique tons of Chinese food, I can say this is pretty damn authentic and I&apos;m really picky about my Chinese food.
Complain about greasy? Well that&apos;s how most Chinese foods are usually cooked! Even the sunny side up eggs my family makes are crispy on the edges. Why? &apos;cause we dump oil all over! And that&apos;s why we have TEA.
My friend took me here on my birthday after I came to Hawaii, and damn, I fell in love! The staff there are nice, and of course, if you speak Cantonese, they&apos;ll love you forever and remember you, and then tell your friend to marry you because you can speak Cantonese well. -- my suggestion is to bring someone who speaks Cantonese, and I promise your service will be much better.
First off, this is a hole-in-a-wall in Waikiki and it&apos;s right near the International Marketplace (so don&apos;t bring a car, just bus, unless you want to pay for parking around the area). Second, there is only 10 seats inside. Third, go for what they have in the Chef&apos;s Choice Special. And last but not least, CASH ONLY!

When you go to the place, it look like a dump, but really, it&apos;s not. It&apos;s wonderful. I met a lady from San Francisco who comes to Hawaii every year (almost 6 years) and eats at Fatty&apos;s. That&apos;s how good it is.
Walk in, and you&apos;ll see the papers on the windows of doors and you&apos;ll see the cashier right there with roasted duck hanging. Pretty small, but just a heads up, if you don&apos;t like being in warm places along with sitting next to someone random, or you&apos;re not good in cramped spaces, just get your food to go and eat outside. Upsetting part though, you&apos;ll miss out on them cooking the food in front of you. That&apos;s how you know it&apos;s fresh!
I ordered Beef Chow Fun, and I was super excited. My friend ordered Garlic Shrimp (because he LOVES it so much). When they cooked in front of me, I was REALLY excited and amused at how they cooked it in the huge wok. And for the price you&apos;d be paying which is about 8 dollars? You&apos;ll get the most of it! Best Chinese food I&apos;ve had since I&apos;ve been here. Happy birthday to me.

In summary: If you bring a car, good luck finding parking in Waikiki, &apos;cause you&apos;ll just be paying in the end, or walking a ton. Bring a person who speaks Cantonese. Bring Cash. Order from their Chef&apos;s Special. And, be happy!

It&apos;s really fast food, everything from curry chicken to udon. They are a tiny shop with maybe a dozen counter stools and a few chairs outside. Flavor was very good. Variety was very good, too. Prices for Waikiki were excellent; go for lunch if you can when prices are really low. Not too salty; they respect custom orders (for allergy sake). The locals, meaning people that work in the area, love the place and for good reason. Why no more stars? Simple: no seating and not deluxe. But for a fast food place, I would give it five stars.

Easy directions: find the Dennys on Kuhio. Go around the corner, N of Denny&apos;s. It&apos;s in the walkway between the hotel that Denny&apos;s is attached to, and the market building just N of it. Tough to miss, but it&apos;s a TINY place.

Whenever visiting the islands I have to stop by for some great Chinese food. Took my friend there once we arrived and boy, we had lunch there and ended up swinging by again for dinner snack. We sat and watch them cook fresh food in front of us, that made us salivate. Order chow fun, great flavor.

Place is very small, grab a seat and enjoy the cooking show. Anything with noodles is fun to watch the chef make his magic.

I always walk by this place when I&apos;m in Waikiki but never have thought to go until I read all the rave reviews on Yelp...Plus, their chow fun (which is my fave) seemed to be their speciality, so I had to check it out.. I went around 8:45 and there were a few people sitting around the counter (set up similar to a small ramen restaurant) and some people waiting to order...Always a good thing late at night.

You can either order entrees or do a plate lunch 1 or 2 or 3 items...I think the prices ranged from around $4.50-6.75 which is great deal, especially for Waikiki. I wanted the  chow fun so I ordered the beef chow fun dry (8.50) while my bf got a plate lunch with shrimp fingers, rice, and beef/broccoli. Total was $14.50 We decided to sit at the counter since we were too hungry to wait to bring it home. As soon as we sat down, they served us water and some chopsticks we we started digging away.

The chow fun was delicious and just how I like it EXCEPT that it was a little too oily. The noodles and veggies were fresh, and the beef was cut thin and was very tender. My bf&apos;s shrimp fingers had  a little too much dough on them but he seemed to like the beef/broccoli (I was too busy eating my chow fun to try his)

All in all, I would definitely check it out again. The service was good, they were attentive with making sure our water&apos;s were refilled and the food was good. Maybe I can give them one more star if they cool it with the oil next time.

CASH ONLY!!

Small hole in the wall place with seats only lining the counter where the chef cooks infront of you, well actually his back towards you, and food made to order and it&apos;s GOOD chinese food, im sold!

My mom brought me here down an alley way lining the international market place, i thought at first she was selling me, or my organs, but really she sold me on this place! it&apos;s located on the side of the miramar hotel before dennys. since i love spicy food, i highly recommend the pork chops or shrimp. taste in every bite! or maybe you&apos;re feelin gravy ishh, then try the beef and black bean sauce.  i&apos;ve tried the noodles too, and it&apos;s the hong kong style so if you&apos;re looking for skinny authentic noodles and don&apos;t want to travel to china town, and still want cheap, this this is the place to eat!

they do have food out to make a combo plate for you locals that like the chinese local food, you know shoyu chicken, chow mein, fried rice, they have a mix plate deal for under 5.00 dollars! that&apos;s right, under, below 5 dollars! im chinese, and i love cheap, but to find good quality chinese food at a CHEAP price, you can&apos;t go wrong here!

Well!  a local secret for &quot;cheap eats&quot; for Waikiki!  Well it&apos;s a hole in the wall Chinese mostly Take-out. Just off of Kuhio between the Denny&apos;s and the Miramar Hotel  But if you like old diner counter cuisine, then belly up to the bar baby, and get a fairly decent Cantonese Rice plate.  This is truly an institution in waiks!

Let&apos;s be serious, if you don&apos;t want to pay an arm and a leg for you Chinese food fix on vacation, then slide up to the counter and be brave they will fix off menu items too.  I go and they make me a rice plate with choy sum and Lop Cheung or Char siu. over steamed rice. and oh so reasonable.  Beats going Hotel fancy kine when your trying to watch your budget.

I tell all my friends if they want grindz and want to save a buck order takeout and go back to room and Grind.  Fo sure da best deal and better than Panda Xpress or buffet junks like that and better than the food in the International Market.  Made to order so you can see the cooks banging the woks!

Heck Chow Na!  braddah, simple and filling.  Remember this is no banquet fare, Oh no my Yelpy friends, this is a quick slam, damn I&apos;m short on Kala affair.  Get a plate and park it somewhere and enjoy.  The chow fun is good but ask them to go light on the Oil. Can!  Eh, not always the most friendly but if they see you their often they will warm up and recognize you.  Their Chow mein etc.  will work.  And for those Haole&apos;s that like the Column A or Column B plate combo&apos;s get em brah!

So the Food is probably only a 3.5 stars, but I give em a 4 for cooking on the fly kind of a free show, at least you know it hasn&apos;t been sitting in a warming tray for hours.  Get creative ask them to make you something off the menu I am sure they can make em. if you don&apos;t see em!

I ordered the combo that was sitting out in the trays and I guess I should have checked a few more of the reviews that may have warned against that. I was confused how this place received so many high ratings.

The food I had was uber greasy. In fact I think that&apos;s pretty much all that I tasted. Service was non-existent. Overall, just a very bad experience. At least it was cheap(?)

If you do decide to try this place, at least I can speak from experience and recommend AGAINST the combo plate.

Mmmm Fatty&apos;s.. doesn&apos;t the name make you wanna eat there even more?! Cash only, beware.

Working in Waikiki, I always try to find the best restaurants for my lunch/dinner breaks.  This place has been here for years - walking on Kuhio its in the back corner of the International Marketplace.  Very small sit-in restaurant, about 10 seats at a counter wrapped around the cooks.

My favorite is the chicken or beef chow fun with choy sum.  I&apos;ve had it tons of times from them, huge size for only $9!  My coworkers like to get the same thing but with fish balls.. there&apos;s cilantro inside the fish balls (I hate cilantro) so I always get chicken or beef. Since the counter is small, its easy to see other people&apos;s food being served - the cold chicken and char siu rice plate looks like the bomb!  Whenever I go, I always see someone order that (seriously, EVERY TIME). I always mean to try it but end up going for the chow fun lol.

The main drawback here is the heat.  Sitting so close to them cooking it right in front of you, theres not much ventilation up in that place.  I also question cleanliness... I know the waitresses help prepare some of the dishes and handle some of the food, while at the same time taking cash and giving out change...

This place is one if those &apos;must visit&apos; things to do on my checklist everytime I visit Oahu. Beef chow fun with Choy Sum and beef fried rice is the best. Coming from Vancouver with such a wide array of authentic Chinese restaurants, Fatty&apos;s chefs are ranked up there as having one of the best &apos;wok hai&apos; style and tastes in Chinese cuisine.

**CASH ONLY**

Fatty&apos;s to me was one of those places I get really excited about when reading the reviews only to be let down with the first bite.  I even stepped outside my boring normal order and tried the beef chow fun because of all the amazing reviews.  The noodles were fatter and mushier than I&apos;m used to and the only flavor it had was that of grease.  I basically picked out all the beef and bokchoy.  I got spring rolls too, worst I&apos;ve ever had.

It&apos;s pretty close to my place so I&apos;m willing to come back to give the fried rice a try.  I was salivating watching them prepare it while I was waiting for my to go order.

Roast duck hanging...check.
Kind of dirty looking hole in the wall...check.
Prompt service without a smile...check.

The smell of whatever the chef was stir frying was intoxicating.  I asked &quot;So what&apos;s good tonight?&quot;  Lady answers &quot;Everything good!  You order!&quot;  So I ordered the roast duck and pork on rice.  It was tasty but wasn&apos;t the best.  The lady never told me what the chef was cooking.

I went to this place a couple of times last week and was surprised to stumble across it. It&apos;s listed as being on Kuhio Avenue but in fact it&apos;s in a walking-only mall at the base of the Miramar Hotel. The rest of the mall is the usual tourist crap with 100% polyester Aloha shirts (lol) but Fatty&apos;s is fantastic. There is always a line but the food is worth it. We loved everything but the shoyu chicken and pineapple fried are sublime. If you are at the International Marketplace, walk from Kalakaua through to Kuhio, make a left and another left into this mall and you&apos;ll find Fatty&apos;s!
There a handful of stools around the kitchen inside but it&apos;s crowded. We tried twice to get a stool at the counter. There is a bench out front and one table with a couple of chairs out front. We took our food to go.

(What up, yelpers? It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve moved to Japan, but I&apos;m currently on vacation to Hawaii. It&apos;s a nice feeling to be able to yelp again...)

This is a dive in the truest sense of the word. It&apos;s small, crowded with only a counter to eat at. It&apos;s smelly (as in no circulation). It feels dirty or at least greasy as the smell of Chinese food seems to seep into your clothes.

It was amazing.

I was jet-lagged from my flight from Japan. I had no sleep on that red-eye and then spent all day walking to get my bearings in Waikiki. Then, I remembered that I can use yelp again. It&apos;s been almost a year since I&apos;ve last made a review. (Japan has not yet been added, though if Paris has one... Tokyo ought to as well...)

I yelped the closest Chinese place to my hostel and up popped this. The first review mentionned that this place makes Beef Chow Fun just the way they like it. Being that it&apos;s my favorite food (and the standard dish I use to compare Chinese restaurants), I had to go.

I was not disappointed. It was everything I&apos;ve missed while living in Japan. (Despite Japan&apos;s proximity to China, Chinese food is terrible, overpriced, and extremely hard to find.) It was greasy, but not too shiny. It had cabbage, which was a bit weird for me, but I could easily overlook it.

My tip: don&apos;t get anything that&apos;s premade in the display--order something fresh and made to order.

Visited Fatty&apos;s at least 4 times while in Waikiki. I love authentic Chinese food. Shit is hard to find in Cali. Everything has been commercialized and tastes like crap.

but not Fatty&apos;s! I love the old Chinese ladies that take my order, I can barely understand them but then I realize that the food will taste that much better! The cook is an older guy with tons of experience, you can tell.

Ordered the Chinese Sausage fried rice, deep fried pork chops and crispy pan fried noodles. Shit was awesome! Eating late night with friends and watching them cook your food in front of you is so badass... nom bitches!

Very Small place just behind the Waikiki International Market.

Wait for a bar stool to open up and sit and watch your meal cooked freshly in front of your eyes.

Very Good Chinese Food !

Around $5.00 per plate

Cash only!! Bewareeee. Don&apos;t be like me and have to do a double take to grab cash. Haha. The place is cheap and derrrricious.

Fatty&apos;s is called Fatty&apos;s for a real. The food will make you feel like a fatty cause it&apos;s soooo nomz. One of my favorite casual Chinese places to go to. Tucked away in an alley right next to the Miramar Hotel and International Market Place, Fatty&apos;s has both an ala carte and take out menu. I prefer the take out menu.

The beef chow fun is my favorite! I&apos;ve also had the Singapore fried noodles and crispy pan fried noodles. Both are also really good choices.

The only thing I would have to complain about is the parking. I can hold this argument for anywhere in Waikiki. Waikiki in general just isn&apos;t very kamaaina friendly. Sucks, right? Parking generally sucks anywhere and everywhere you go in Waikiki. Keep searching on Ala Wai Blvd or down one of the side streets. I&apos;ve also seen a pay-for-park lot down the street where the Coffee Bean is.

Also, I would recommend calling in your order if you know what you want and don&apos;t want to wait.

Ended up here because I think I confused it with some other place I was looking for on yelp. oops. There was a lot of people eating in there and that usually signals good food. Don&apos;t expect to be seated if you&apos;re a group. There&apos;s room for about 12 heads max, at a counter. They have lined up chairs outside, but no tables. They should though. Prime outdoor seating space, and you wouldn&apos;t smell like the kitchen, since they cook right in front of you.  Definitely a hole in the wall.

Quick, cheap, greasy spoon, OK chinese food. Not wow, just meh.
