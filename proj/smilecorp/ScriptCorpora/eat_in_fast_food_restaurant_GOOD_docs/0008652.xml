Thomas Sowell: Income inequality is numbers game

 Posted November 9, 2011 at midnight 

 Discuss Print A A A 
 

 
One of the things that has struck me, when I have gone on luxury cruise ships, is that most of the passengers look like they are older than the captain — and luxury cruise ships don&apos;t have juveniles as captains.

The reason for the elderly clientele is fairly simple: Most people don&apos;t reach the point when they can afford to travel on luxury cruise ships until they have worked their way up the income ladder over a long period of years.

The relationship between age and income is not hard to understand. It usually takes years to acquire the skills and experience that high-paying jobs require, or to build up a clientele for those in business or the professions.

But those in the media and in politics who are currently up in arms, denouncing income inequalities, seldom mention age as a factor in those inequalities.

The shrill rhetoric about differences in income proceeds as if they are talking about income inequalities between different classes of people. It would be hard to get the public all worked up over the fact that young people just starting out in their careers are not making nearly as much money as their parents or grandparents make.

Differences in wealth between the young and the old are even greater than differences in income. Households headed by someone 65 years old and older have more than 15 times as much wealth as households headed by someone under 35 years of age.

But these are not different classes of people, as so often insinuated in runaway political rhetoric. Everybody who is 65 years old was once under 35 years of age. And most people under 35 years of age will someday be 65 years old.

Differences in age are just one of the reasons why the insinuations about income and wealth that are thrown around in the media and in politics are often remote from reality.

While the rhetoric is about people, the statistics are almost invariably about abstract income brackets.

It is easier and cheaper to collect statistics about income brackets than it is to follow actual flesh and blood people as they move massively from one income bracket to another over the years.

More important, statistical studies that follow particular individuals over the years often reach diametrically opposite conclusions from the conclusions reached by statistical studies that follow income brackets over the years.

Currently we are hearing a lot in the media and in politics about the &quot;top 1 percent&quot; of income earners who are supposedly getting an ever-increasing share of the nation&apos;s income.

That is absolutely true if you are talking about income brackets. It is totally untrue if you are talking about actual flesh and blood people.

The Internal Revenue Service can follow individual people over the years because they can identify individuals from their Social Security numbers. During recent years, when &quot;the top 1 percent&quot; as an income category has been getting a growing share of the nation&apos;s income, IRS data show that actual flesh and blood people who were in the top 1 percent in 1996 had their incomes go down — repeat, DOWN — by a whopping 26 percent by 2005.

How can both sets of statistics be true at the same time? Because most people who are in the top 1 percent in a given year do not stay in that bracket over the years.

If we are being serious — as distinguished from being political — then our concern should be with what is happening to actual flesh and blood human beings, not what is happening to abstract income brackets.

There is the same statistical problem when talking about &quot;the poor&quot; as there is when talking about &quot;the rich.&quot;

A University of Michigan study showed that most of the working people who were in the bottom 20 percent of income earners in 1975 were also in the top 40 percent at some point by 1991. Only 5 percent of those in the bottom quintile in 1975 were still there in 1991, while 29 percent of them were now in the top quintile.

People in the media and in politics choose statistics that seem to prove what they want to prove. But the rest of us should become aware of what games are being played with numbers.

Inequality is a numbers game? How about the opinion of the American people that the middle class are getting screwed, and the wealthy need to pay their fair share of taxes? According to polls, the Washington Post reports that the responsible sectors of the American electorate know the truth about the ‘numbers game’:

“More than six in 10 Americans see a widening gap between the wealthy and the less well-off in this country, and about as many want the federal government to try to shrink the divide, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.

Democrats and independents largely support government policies to reduce the wealth gap, while most Republicans oppose such action. The issue cuts even more sharply along a new political fault line, with tea party supporters and those backing the fledgling Occupy Wall Street movement on opposite sides of the question.”

Forget about &apos;opinions&apos; for a minute...forget for a minute whether you like Sowell or not...can you prove that Sowell is wrong in this instance by using facts?

Sowell says: “During recent years, when&quot;the top 1 percent&quot;as an income category has been getting a growing share of the nation&apos;s income, IRS data show that actual flesh and blood people who were in the top 1 percent in 1996 had their incomes go down — repeat, DOWN — by a whopping 26 percent by 2005.”

Leave it to Sowell to come up with his own statistics that show the wealthy top 1% to be getting poorer, while all other statistics posted by other researchers shows just the opposite. But Sowell, like a lot of conservatives, lives in a bizarro alternate universe.

Many researchers, such as UC Santa Cruz professor G. William Domhoff, come to different conclusions about the increasing wealth of the top 1%, as well as the top 10%. For facts, see link and excerpts below:

 http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesame... 

In the United States, wealth is highly concentrated in a relatively few hands. As of 2007, the top 1% of households (the upper class) owned 34.6% of all privately held wealth, and the next 19% (the managerial, professional, and small business stratum) had 50.5%, which means that just 20% of the people owned a remarkable 85%, leaving only 15% of the wealth for the bottom 80% (wage and salary workers). In terms of financial wealth (total net worth minus the value of one&apos;s home), the top 1% of households had an even greater share: 42.7%. Table 1 and Figure 1 present further details drawn from the careful work of economist Edward N. Wolff at New York University (2010).

In terms of types of financial wealth, the top one percent of households have 38.3% of all privately held stock, 60.6% of financial securities, and 62.4% of business equity. The top 10% have 80% to 90% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and over 75% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-producing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America.

See my 6:14 AM post, and read the entire research piece by Professor Dumhoff. Then get back to me if you see any glaring discrepancies in his research that show that the wealthy are getting wealthier.

Mr. Sowell makes this statement at the end of HIS number manipulations on his syndicated column in the media.

The top 1% in wealth is the issue, not income. Sowell has changed the subject to fit his style of commenting on behalf of right wing orthodoxy.

Notice he used the term&quot;ever-increasing&quot;, which means that there is a&quot;trend&quot;towards greater income disparity which is what people are protesting about.

So maybe someone can explain why he tries to downplay this fact with various other numbers and statistics, just like he accuses the elite intelligentsia in the media of doing?

A rhetorical question, of course.

Good Editorial Tom,

People are not numbers or statistics, they are human beings who have&quot;free will&quot;to choose the course they want to take through life!

Fewer are choosing the harder road to success, partly because the government has provided another alternative for them, that is, dependence on the government.

Nevertheless, those who choose to live off the government are the ones who still made the choice, for many of them it is all they and their families know!

The idea that people should be Responsible and Accountable for their own decisions and actions is exactly what the OWS movement is protesting against, they don&apos;t want to be held accountable for the choices they made, and they direct their anger at the very group of people who had absolutely nothing to do with their plight!

Bottom line, the government has been methodically imposing itself into each and every cavity of our lives, our schools, our businesses, in our personal lives, what we eat, what we drink, what we drive, and they want to control how we think!

Whatever the cost, freedom and liberty are worth a hundred fold more, and we the people should never allow the government to strip them away from us for any reason, we must reunite as Americans who are proud of their country, not ashamed as the left would want us to be, we should be grateful to our Creator, for God Blessed this nation for hundreds of years, standing together in unity, and we the people can and must reclaim the government.

No more class warfare rhetoric, it is all poppycock, we know whose agenda benefits by dividing the people of this nation, by inciting hatred in one group towards another, and would like nothing less than the total meltdown and destruction of the United States of America, the Marxists and Socialists in our government.

&quot;A nation of well informed men who have been taught to know and prize the rights which God has given them cannot be enslaved. It is in the religion of ignorance that tyranny begins.&quot;
- Benjamin Franklin

Based on my other agreement with Mr. Sowell that age is a factor in wealth, my guess is that these&quot;flesh and blood&quot;people RETIRED during that time period.

The liberals can&apos;t dispute his facts so they just go with the abstract numbers rather than tracking REAL people. When I was young and went to college after getting out of the military, I was&quot;poor&quot;too. I made waaaay below the&quot;poverty&quot;line but I put myself through school with the GI bill and working 20-30 hours per week as a bartender/bouncer. It wasn&apos;t until I was in my late thirties, years after graduating college, could I ever even think about luxuries like long vacations, etc. I still am frugal as I keep the temp down to around 60, live in a 1000 sq. foot house, etc. Kids nowadays just expect a good paying $50k/yr job waiting for them when they graduate with a history degree. It doesn&apos;t work like that, and if you want to talk tough times, talk to your great grandparents about the Great Depression. These are good times compared to then. But, nope, they want to rail against the&quot;unfairness&quot;and&quot;inequality&quot;....

See what happens when you coddle kids and give &apos;em ALL trophies just for showing up? You get friggin&apos; spoiled brats who don&apos;t know that sports translate to real life: there are winners and losers, so get over it. Some people are just born smarter, stronger, more talented, etc. and no laws/rules will change that, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t succeed if you work harder and prepare smarter... But, to hell with that, just gimme my trophy! Waaaah!

So, the real complaint according to you and Mr. Sowell is that there aren&apos;t enough YOUNG people in the top 1%?

Now we finally know what the OWS movement is all about. It&apos;s not class warfare, but a matter of age discrimination.

Thank you.

I am in the middle class, and the last few years have been tough on me and my family, just like it has with a lot of people.

But I do not feel that I have been&quot;screwed&quot;?

What is the difference between my story and yours?

He is not coming up with his own statistics. He is saying if you track the actual people (as opposed to a statistical group), the numbers tell a different story. The top 1% is getting wealthier apparently as a statistical group, but the group is ever changing. He is saying if you look at the top 1% from 1996, that same group of individuals has seen their income drop by 26% by 2005.

In other words, they are not the top 1% any more.

The way the statistics are presented, you would think that the top 1% from 1996 would be really wealthy by now, but apparently that is not the case.

You can make the argument that this does not matter. But Sowell is not coming up with his own statistics. He is honestly looking at it in a different way. And you incorrectly feel he is making something up or trying to trick us.

Even if you disagree with his conclusions, it is interesting information that gives you another way to look at the issue.

I believe Skeptic is using the term&quot;screwed&quot;figuratively.

You sound as if you are using it literally.

Chris, you missed the part in which he expands on his use of the word&quot;supposedly...

&quot;That is absolutely true if you are talking about income brackets&quot;

The top 1% is by definition an income bracket.

I agree that a percentage is not a static group of individuals, but that does not address the fact that the trend in income disparity is growing.

That, in my view, is the crux of the issue and Mr. Sowell is just trying to take our eyes off of this troubling trend.

Would it be equally logical if I use his argument the next time someone states that the lower 49% don&apos;t pay federal income taxes?

But, to hell with that, just gimme my trophy! Waaaah!
 
“The liberals can&apos;t dispute his facts so they just go with the abstract numbers rather than tracking REAL people.”

I did dispute Sowell’s facts. And I provided a link to UC Santa Cruz professor Dumhoff’s research that includes those facts in an earlier post today. Read Dumhoff’s long research piece, and if you can find any glaring discrepancies, I’d like to know. In fact, I have in the past posted links to other sources, some conservative like the Heritage Foundation, that also show the unmistakable trend that the wealthy continue to get much wealthier, while the middle class effectively stagnates.

You stated: ‘When I was young and went to college after getting out of the military, I was&quot;poor&quot;too. I made waaaay below the&quot;poverty&quot;line but I put myself through school with the GI bill and working 20-30 hours per week as a bartender/bouncer. It wasn&apos;t until I was in my late thirties, years after graduating college, could I ever even think about luxuries like long vacations’.

Coincidentally, my personal history is very similar to yours, completing college at UC Berkeley with a graduate degree while being supported by the GI Bill, and not having enough income until my late 30’s to kick back a bit and enjoy some long vacations. But I have a more positive outlook regarding young people today than you do. As in our generation, most will be successful and will adapt to today’s tough jobs environment. I know this after seeing thousands of youngsters at school functions over the last 8 years.

&quot;People in the media and in politics choose statistics that seem to prove what they want to prove. But the rest of us should become aware of what games are being played with numbers.&quot;

Mr. Sowell makes this statement at the end of HIS number manipulations on his syndicated column in the media.

LOL!
 
He is using accurate statistics to prove his point&quot;People in the media and in politics choose statistics that seem to prove what they want to prove&quot;.

What is so funny about that? What better way to show this than to use actual statistics that paint a different picture.

Did you realize that there was so much change in the make up of the statistical categories? If not, it is an interesting fact to consider when weighing out the&quot;fairness&quot;of the&quot;tax the rich&quot;mantra.

Might not matter one way or another. But don&apos;t see why folks are so indignant. One guy says he is&quot;making&quot;stuff up. And you mock him because he proves his point in a way you don&apos;t seem to approve of.

Now we finally know what the OWS movement is all about. It&apos;s not class warfare, but a matter of age discrimination.

Thank you.
 
Who knows what the&quot;real&quot;complaint is because it all depends on what group of anarchists/Marxists/hippies/stoners/brats get interviewed.

I too get upset when you read about billion dollar corporations in effect paying a NEGATIVE tax rate (basically collecting money from the taxpayer) or oligarchs passing laws like the&quot;Facebook rule&quot;so that the rest of us riffraff can&apos;t get in on the ground floor IPOs as they trade in secret. The&quot;inequality&quot;doesn&apos;t bother me because in many ways life is like sports and you can&apos;t pass a law turning everyone into Micheal Jordan as not everyone is born with the same level of talent, smarts or even drive/ambition. Life ain&apos;t fair, and there are winners and losers, even on a&quot;level playing field&quot;... Now, when the system is rigged with special laws for Micheal Jordan, I got a problem with that. Narrow the focus on closing tax loopholes and simplifying the tax code so the average person doesn&apos;t have to get a CPA would be a nice start, but that&apos;s too simple for the Owies, I guess.

Where I see&quot;us&quot;getting screwed by our corporate owned government is at ground level.

I just scanned the article you linked to and I failed to see the part that disputes Dr. Sowell&apos;s research. In fact, I didn&apos;t see any figures relating to real people and how they track in income and wealth accumulation in life... Yes, the elderly today have a greater percentage of wealth than ever before, but what do you want to do about it? Confiscate it? Institute a&quot;wealth tax&quot;? Or maybe something more modest: means testing for Social Security so Bill Gates and Warren Buffet aren&apos;t collecting an SS check they don&apos;t need? Good luck with that one though because seniors have been told over the years that SS is a&quot;right&quot;and that it&apos;s payment for their&quot;investment&quot;over the years.

There are no facts to argue,as the&quot;facts&quot;Sowell presents are MEANT to hide. to deceive and to confuse. They are cherry-picked to HIDE reality, not expose it.They are no more reality based than most of Sowell&apos;s elitist bleatings.

But there is no mistaking Sowell&apos;s goal, to carry water for the wealthy, just like last week and the week before.

I can see why some seem to feel so miserable and mad when they don&apos;t even think they have the power or ability to be anything except for someone else&apos;s slave.

Jack_Bauer, and all who have endured the race to retirement and beyond, are to be commended. Job well done! But Jack, the America you and I grew up in no longer functions the same. We no longer dominate the manufacturing market - many many jobs have been outsourced to be done by slave labor abroad. We no longer encourage higher education - institutions of higher learning are now functioning as corporate entities for the most part. And try starting life out
with a five or six figure debt to pay off. Business climate has changed - remember when a
person&apos;s word was their bond?? I do. Not so
anymore, it seems. In fact, the laws have been
completely rewritten to favor ponzi like business
instruments that ultimately hurt the middle class
who hold the tax burden, as in bailing out the
banksters of our last housing debacle for
instance. Corporations have become &apos;persons&apos;,
immune to redress of grievances by employees
and/ or customers. The very wealthy used to
know that philanthrophy was a civic responsibility
- that helping the needy kept society safer and
besides, it felt good to help. perhaps they understood that all great wealth ultimately came from the use of our once abundant natural resources, and that these resources were the gifts of the Earth, belonging to all humans and that human labor allowed these gifts to create a better standard of life for all. Now they don&apos;t want to part with any of their wealth for the common good. So what can we expect? Young people have much less opportunity than we did, for various reasons, and they are far more knowledgeable about the world and the state of our nation. No wonder they are protesting inequities!
The current system is rigged toward more profit - damn the poor! They aren&apos;t smart or fast enough...let them suffer in the poverty they have chosen. It&apos;s the natural order of things afterall. Nevermind that humans aren&apos;t beasts, even if the ones controlling things are acting like predators.

You may feel that you are not getting screwed, and asking individuals about their own situation is fine, but as I stated, it is the opinion of most of the American people that the middle class are in fact getting screwed. Do you doubt that national polls are reflecting this opinion?

Of course, if you were unaware that:
15-25 million Americans are unemployed or under employed as a direct result of the 2008 Great Recession.
$trillions of dollars in investments and retirement funds were lost as a result of the Great Recession, many belonging to middle class households, and
Tens of millions of Americans, mostly those in the middle class, have underwater mortgages, or have lost their homes to foreclosure, or are in the process of losing their homes.

...then you could be blase about the situation many middle class folks find themselves in.

With these facts at hand, any reasonable person would conclude that the middle class are in fact feeling that they have been screwed, screwed by the system, screwed by the government, screwed by an economic system that favors the wealthy, that they are being screwed by a system that is beyond their control.

The middle class is being&quot;screwed&quot;as everyone is putting it because when we fail we have to take responsibility for those decisions and then have to do the hard work to get everything back on track. When these CEO&apos;s of big corporations make bad decisions, the government steps in and saves them with our tax money. Even in the worst corporation scandals, the CEO gets let go with a care package that would support many families for their entire lives.

It&apos;s not income disparity per se that people oppose, Sowell, you wizened old professional liar.

It&apos;s the growing disparity between the rich and the middle class that has people up in arms. It&apos;s the fact that the rich have grown far richer over the past 30 years of the&quot;Reagan Revolution,&quot;while the middle class and poor have both lost percentage shares of the wealth that this nation generates. The middle class has decreased in size -- it&apos;s getting smaller. The size of the poor class is growing larger.

People are up in arms about the Big Conservative Lie: It&apos;s the rich that provide jobs. It&apos;s a monstrous lie, because the rich are sitting on their money and not creating jobs -- they&apos;re hoarding their cash. Meanwhile, the disposable income of the middle class -- money that actually DOES produce jobs by creating demand -- is continuing to shrink.

America&apos;s Legions of Fools are led to believe that all we need to do is create conditions that would allow the rich to prosper even more, and all will be well. So, how are the Bush tax cuts for the rich treating y&apos;all? We&apos;re more than 10 years in, and the economy cratered about 8 years in. Is everyone feeling like the promise of prosperity that supposedly follows making the rich even richer is working out well?

I mean, we all know it&apos;s working out well for the rich. How &apos;bout the rest of us chumps?

The top 1% in wealth is the issue, not income. Sowell has changed the subject to fit his style of commenting on behalf of right wing orthodoxy.
 
Exactly. And that&apos;s why this entire article is a worthless piece of crap.

This is what he is basing his argument on:
 http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financ.. .

Nowhere does it talk about income, which is not the same as wealth.

============================

Older Americans today started off at the beginning of our Golden Era and had many advantages not afforded the youth of today.

1) a living wage
2) affordable health care
2) affordable housing
3) affordable education

California had a 100-year history of free higher education until Reagan became governor. The UC system was tuition-free until the late &apos;60s.

As for housing, let&apos;s take a 70-year-old person today and say he bought a home in San Francisco at age 30 in 1971.

It would have cost him $16,200. Today, adjusted for inflation, that house would cost him $90,918.79. Instead it costs $632,485. Granted, this is SF, but housing takes a much larger percentage of people&apos;s income everywhere.

Not only can today&apos;s youth not afford homes, but tuition has skyrocketed, grants and loans are harder to get, minimum wage barely puts a roof over one&apos;s head and then when they graduate with all their debts, a low-wage job with no benefits -- or no job at all - is waiting for them. Why go to college in the first place?

============================

This is not the American dream. These people are not lazy. They are just not fortunate to have been born during their grandparents time, and a major reason why they are not fortunate is a 30-40 year plan by the economic elite to starve the beast of government (we the people) so they are free to pillage. And that&apos;s exactly what they have done.

This isn&apos;t about working your way up and scrimping and saving, it&apos;s about luck. They feel these goals are now out of reach for them - and it is because of deliberate government policy that favors the already wealthy, cutting their taxes and shifting the burden onto the middle class - and that is why they are taking to the streets because it is the only way to have their voices heard.

===========================

&quot;A CBO study in 2011 found that the top 1% gained the most (about 275%) in the period between 1979 and 2007, and all lower quintiles lost their share of national INCOME.&quot;

This is the issue: lost opportunities to live a decent middle class life through hard work because the rich have bought off the politicians.

Inequality is a numbers game? How about the opinion of the American people that the middle class are getting screwed, and the wealthy need to pay their fair share of taxes? According to polls, the Washington Post reports that the responsible sectors of the American electorate know the truth about the ‘numbers game’:

“More than six in 10 Americans see a widening gap between the wealthy and the less well-off in this country, and about as many want the federal government to try to shrink the divide, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.

Democrats and independents largely support government policies to reduce the wealth gap, while most Republicans oppose such action. The issue cuts even more sharply along a new political fault line, with tea party supporters and those backing the fledgling Occupy Wall Street movement on opposite sides of the question.”
 
I&apos;m really growing weary of all this noise about Republicans protecting the rich and the Democrats want to help the poor and middle class. Look at your own community organizer in chief, QE1, QE2, QE? who did he give money to?
THE RICH, he didn&apos;t give ANY money to the poor and middle class, what hypocrits you are.
And what did the&quot;rich&quot;do with the money, they stuck it in their pockets and foreclosed our homes anyway, moved their business off shore and screwed the poor and middle class anyway. Yeah, Democrats have a great plan to SAVE AMERICA..

So to start off Mr Sowell&apos;s article, his example of the older you are, the more money you have is cruise ships, because when he is on them he witnesses more elderly people on them than younger. Okay, well instead of income, lets look at the physical aspects. It has always been stereotypical that elderly people like cruse ships more because it isn&apos;t as taxing physically as other vacations. You don&apos;t have to drive long distances and there are a multitude of activities to last the entire trip right on the ship itself. A lot of younger people prefer to travel and do more active things. If you price out vacations, cruising is actually cheaper than many other vacation plans.

If you want statistics, a Bloomberg Buisnessweek article using figures from the census bureau states that 15.9% of Americans 65 and older are living in poverty, which is slightly higher than the stated 15.2% overall poverty rate.

Young people are up in arms because they see what people like Sowell are accepting as just the way it is. They see the higher costs of getting an education, skyrocketing health care, and the disparity between rising living costs and stagnant wages, while the corporations are being bailed out by our tax money and the CEO&apos;s of those and other corporations are piling on raises and bonuses themselves.

You cannot use age as a end all factor in the disparity between wealth. Yes, it is a factor, but costs and times have changed so much, you cannot take it as the only or even most major reason. With cost of living rising every year and the dollar losing value, it is more difficult now to make a living than ever before. There was manufacturing back when the now elderly were young. There was more opportunity. Now people are scrambling over minimum wage job openings while the corporations pull in massive profits from low cost, overseas labor.

Sowell mentions playing on statistics which he does quite well. He states that the top 1% saw an income decrease of 26% from 1996 to 2005 but offers nothing of the other side. This is typical one sided propaganda, the exact thing he is accusing everyone else of doing. Why doesn&apos;t Mr. Sowell offer up information of the bottom 99% and how their incomes changed in the same time period? Perhaps they went down as well? Again, he quotes a Michigan study where&quot;most&quot;(what is most by the way? Are we talking 50.1%, 75%, 90%?) of the people in the bottom 20% of income earners were in the top 40% within 16 years. Well of course, that gives the high school or college person plenty of time to get out of the fast food restaurant wage into something else. Again a very vague statement with little information. What is the average wage difference that is needed to reach that 40th percentile? An extra dollar above minimum wage?

Mr Sowell accuses the skewing of statistics to support an argument, but does the same thing by only providing the facts to support his. Why RS keeps giving this person a platform is beyond me.

&quot;The 1% are the very best destroyers of wealth the world has ever seen
Our common treasury in the last 30 years has been captured by industrial psychopaths. That&apos;s why we&apos;re nearly bankrupt&quot;

&quot;If wealth was the inevitable result of hard work and enterprise, every woman in Africa would be a millionaire.&quot;

And that&apos;s absolute truth.

It isn&apos;t&quot;hard work&quot;that produces huge incomes or great wealth.
This is a straightforward lie.

&quot;What has happened over the past 30 years is the capture of the world&apos;s common treasury by a handful of people, assisted by neoliberal policies which were first imposed on rich nations by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.&quot;

And Sowell is one of the foremost salesmen of that neoliberal economic thinking. Here he is today, hawking the same old failed thinking.

And it isn&apos;t lack of productivity but who benefits from that which is the real issue.
If productivity were the measure, American labor would be getting paid FAR more.

&quot;Between 1947 and 1979, productivity in the US rose by 119%, while the income of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 122%. But from 1979 to 2009, productivity rose by 80%, while the income of the bottom fifth fell by 4%. In roughly the same period, the income of the top 1% rose by 270%.&quot;

Sowell can spin the figures all he cares to as he isn&apos;t trying to disprove anything, he knows he can&apos;t really do that, but to mislead the easily fooled that this is all good for you.

in response to Jack_Bauer :

I just scanned the article you linked to and I failed to see the part that disputes Dr. Sowell&apos;s research. In fact, I didn&apos;t see any figures relating to real people and how they track in income and wealth accumulation in life... Yes, the elderly today have a greater percentage of wealth than ever before, but what do you want to do about it? Confiscate it? Institute a&quot;wealth tax&quot;? Or maybe something more modest: means testing for Social Security so Bill Gates and Warren Buffet aren&apos;t collecting an SS check they don&apos;t need? Good luck with that one though because seniors have been told over the years that SS is a&quot;right&quot;and that it&apos;s payment for their&quot;investment&quot;over the years.
 
Jack, if you looked at the Table 1 chart, and had read the first few pages of text in the Domhoff research, you would have come to the same conclusion I did. Sowell talks about “income” only. Domhoff states that for most of the wealthy, their annual incomes don’t reflect their financial wealth, as most of their wealth comes from “marketable assets, such as real estate, stocks, and bonds”. Domhoff provides data from the years 1995 to 2004 for Net Worth and Financial Wealth, showing that Net Worth decreased about 11% during those years (compared to Sowell’s assertion of a drop of 25%), which Domhoff attributes primarily to the crash in the stock market in 2000 due to the dot.com bubble bursting. But the overall trend from 1976 to 2010 is unmistakable, with the wealthy getting wealthier, and the middle class stagnating. Sowell is just cherry picking some information, there is no supporting documentation for his assertions (no links), and he is missing the big picture, as outlined below.

Putting things into perspective in comparing the wealth accumulation of the 1% and the bottom 80% (the middle class got screwed):

“Here are some dramatic facts that sum up how the wealth distribution became even more concentrated between 1983 and 2004, in good part due to the tax cuts for the wealthy and the defeat of labor unions: Of all the new financial wealth created by the American economy in that 21-year-period, fully 42% of it went to the top 1%. A whopping 94% went to the top 20%, which of course means that the bottom 80% received only 6% of all the new financial wealth generated in the United States during the &apos;80s, &apos;90s, and early 2000s (Wolff, 2007).

Again, putting things into perspective in comparing the drop in wealth for the top 1% compared to average Americans as a result of the 2008 recession:

So far there are only tentative projections -- based on the price of housing and stock in July 2009 -- on the effects of the Great Recession on the wealth distribution. They suggest that average Americans have been hit much harder than wealthy Americans. Edward Wolff, the economist we draw upon the most in this document, concludes that there has been an&quot;astounding&quot;36.1% drop in the wealth (marketable assets) of the median household since the peak of the housing bubble in 2007. By contrast, the wealth of the top 1% of households dropped by far less: just 11.1%. So as of April 2010, it looks like the wealth distribution is even more unequal than it was in 2007. (See Wolff, 2010 for more details.)

The middle class is being&quot;screwed&quot;as everyone is putting it because when we fail we have to take responsibility for those decisions and then have to do the hard work to get everything back on track. When these CEO&apos;s of big corporations make bad decisions, the government steps in and saves them with our tax money. Even in the worst corporation scandals, the CEO gets let go with a care package that would support many families for their entire lives.
 
We did get screwed as tax payers in that situation. But the people who feel they got screwed do not pay much (if anything) in the way of fed income taxes. So it did not hurt them personally, although it has contributed to our mammoth national debt.

Seems like the ire should be at the government though. It was this President (and Bush too) along with our elected leaders that gave the money away. When the government is giving money away, most people or corporations will take it. But it is the governments fault to give it away in the first place.

What is odd about this&quot;we are getting screwed&quot;type of message is that many folks that have this message want the government bigger and more intrusive. Yet that is precisely who&quot;screwed&quot;them.

Weird.

Exactly. And that&apos;s why this entire article is a worthless piece of crap.

This is what he is basing his argument on:
 http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financ.. .

Nowhere does it talk about income, which is not the same as wealth.

============================

Older Americans today started off at the beginning of our Golden Era and had many advantages not afforded the youth of today.

1) a living wage
2) affordable health care
2) affordable housing
3) affordable education

California had a 100-year history of free higher education until Reagan became governor. The UC system was tuition-free until the late &apos;60s.

As for housing, let&apos;s take a 70-year-old person today and say he bought a home in San Francisco at age 30 in 1971.

It would have cost him $16,200. Today, adjusted for inflation, that house would cost him $90,918.79. Instead it costs $632,485. Granted, this is SF, but housing takes a much larger percentage of people&apos;s income everywhere.

Not only can today&apos;s youth not afford homes, but tuition has skyrocketed, grants and loans are harder to get, minimum wage barely puts a roof over one&apos;s head and then when they graduate with all their debts, a low-wage job with no benefits -- or no job at all - is waiting for them. Why go to college in the first place?

============================

This is not the American dream. These people are not lazy. They are just not fortunate to have been born during their grandparents time, and a major reason why they are not fortunate is a 30-40 year plan by the economic elite to starve the beast of government (we the people) so they are free to pillage. And that&apos;s exactly what they have done.

This isn&apos;t about working your way up and scrimping and saving, it&apos;s about luck. They feel these goals are now out of reach for them - and it is because of deliberate government policy that favors the already wealthy, cutting their taxes and shifting the burden onto the middle class - and that is why they are taking to the streets because it is the only way to have their voices heard.

===========================

&quot;A CBO study in 2011 found that the top 1% gained the most (about 275%) in the period between 1979 and 2007, and all lower quintiles lost their share of national INCOME.&quot;

This is the issue: lost opportunities to live a decent middle class life through hard work because the rich have bought off the politicians.
 
&quot;This is not the American dream. These people are not lazy. They are just not fortunate to have been born during their grandparents time, and a major reason why they are not fortunate is a 30-40 year plan by the economic elite to starve the beast of government (we the people) so they are free to pillage. And that&apos;s exactly what they have done.&quot;

WELL SAID!

Sowell is doing damage control for the wealthy, being their Ivory Tower spokesperson, as the public becomes increasingly aware of and concerned with the real problem.

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/busines... 

More than six in 10 Americans see a widening gap between the wealthy and the less well-off in this country, and about as many want the federal government to try to shrink the divide, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.&quot;

Regardless of Sowell&apos;s pile of fertilizer.

&quot;In official statistics, income disparities between the highest earners and other Americans have reached levels not seen since the Great Depression&quot;

Sowell did everything he could to take the reader&apos;s attention from this fact. He attempted to disguise it by pointing over there as if over there really mattered. Typical of Sowell.

&quot;Where you and I differ is, this seems to be fine with you and I feel it must be stopped.&quot;

The difference between you and me is not that I think it is ok to rape and pillage and you do not. It is that you have a doomsday view of our situation and I do not. I don&apos;t think we are heading for catstrophe with the climate, and I do not believe we have used 90% of the earths resources in the last 50 years. And you do.

I think the biggest difference is that you are generally pessimistic, and I am generally optimistic.

Note that I do not think this is why the skeptic feels he is being screwed. But I could be wrong.
 
The one fact that you evade and refuse to acknowledge is the fact that it is the world of science that is revealing the catastrophic events I post. NONE of it that belongs to me but I do accept it after in depth research into the evidence the scientists offer.

Your&quot;optimism&quot;resides in the denial of scientific reality and the proof of that is revealed by the fact that you have never revealed your sources of climate change information.

I believe you avoid the scientific evidence so you can remain in denial.

Regardless, the question remains: What do you do about this&quot;wealth disparity&quot;? The liberal solutions I&apos;ve seen are: raise the income tax. Well, that does NOTHING to the Kennedys, Bushes, etc. who have already accumulated the wealth or to guys like Buffet who work the system so that they take a minimal salary (under $100k) while taking the majority of their compensation in the form of stock options and dividends which are taxed at a lower rate of capital gains... It all comes down to: SO WHAT?!?!? What do you propose we do about it and how will that&quot;fix things&quot;? Or, even worse, what about the costs and the unintended consequences with the&quot;fixes&quot;?

Where the Owies can get some traction is putting out some less radical, common sense reforms that should have widespread support from both sides of the aisle. One is tax reform wherein tax loopholes are closed such that billion dollar corporations aren&apos;t actually getting kickbacks in the form of&quot;tax refunds&quot;. Another would be means testing Social Security so Warren Buffet ain&apos;t getting a check from the taxpayer that amounts to pocket change for him...

I love it when the black economist in the ivory tower dismisses growing wealth disparity from the deck of a luxury cruise ship.
 
I&apos;m not sure what his being black has to do with anything. Also, you don&apos;t have to be wealthy to travel on a luxury cruise ship. I&apos;m not, and I have been a few times. I typically have to save for a few years to afford it.

China Threatens Massive Venting of Super Greenhouse Gases in Attempt to Extort Billions as UNFCCC Meeting Approaches

WASHINGTON, Nov. 8, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- In the run-up to the international climate negotiations in Durban later this month, China has responded to efforts to ban the trading of widely discredited HFC-23 offsets by threatening to release huge amounts of the potent industrial chemical into the atmosphere unless other nations pay what amounts to a climate ransom.

China&apos;s threat comes after the European Union and other nations moved to ban HFC-23 credits from internal carbon markets in recognition of the perverse incentives created by these credits under the UN Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The vast amounts paid for HFC-23 offsets have led factories in China and elsewhere to manufacture far more HCFC-22 and its HFC-23 by-product than necessary, just to maximize the amounts paid to destroy HFC-23 through the UN-backed carbon trading scheme.

In a shocking attempt to blackmail the international community, Xie Fei, revenue management director at the China Clean Development Mechanism Fund, threatened:&quot;If there&apos;s no trading of [HFC-23] credits, they&apos;ll stop incinerating the gases&quot;and vent them directly into the atmosphere. Speaking at the Carbon Forum Asia in Singapore last week, Xie Fei claimed he spoke for&quot;almost all the big Chinese producers of HFCs who&quot;can&apos;t bear the cost&quot;and maintain that&quot;they&apos;ll lose competitiveness&quot;.

China&apos;s claim belies the fact that HFC-23 can be destroyed for just 0.20 cents per CO2e tonne. The destruction of one CO2e tonne generates one Certified Emission Reduction (CER) under the CDM, which historically has been sold on carbon markets at an average price of $18 -- 70 times the actual cost of destroying HFC-23.

Because of these vast profits, China has repeatedly rejected attempts to destroy HFC-23 emissions through the Montreal Protocol. At the 2009 and 2010 Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, China blocked progress of a North American proposal to pay the actual costs of destroying HFC-23 emissions at plants not currently covered by the CDM, which account for over half of developing country HFC-23 production.

HFC-23 is produced as an unintentional by-product of the refrigerant HCFC-22, itself a powerful greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance. This means that the quantity of HFC-23 produced is directly related to the production of HCFC-22. HFC-23 is an important contributor to climate change because of its incredibly high 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 14,800.
