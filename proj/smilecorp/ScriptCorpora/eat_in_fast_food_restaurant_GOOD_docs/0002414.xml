Two men are accused of agreeing to buy expensive items from people advertising on Craigslist, grabbing the items from the victims once they meet up, and then going back onto Craigslist to try to resell the items — including an $8,000 watch, authorities said.

Jonathan D. Miller, 18, of Carpentersville was charged with theft after stealing the $8,000 watch then attempting to sell it back to its original owner, prosecutors said.

Myshawn L. Bonds, 19, of Carpentersville, was charged theft after robbing a man of his MacBook Pro laptop computer after that victim agreed to sell it on Craigslist, prosecutors said.

Carpentersville police Cmdr. Tim Bosshart said a Skokie man told police he met with two men at 2 p.m. Sunday in the parking lot of Dundee-Crown High School to sell the men an $8,000 Roger Dubuis watch he had posted on Craigslist.

When the victim showed up, the men grabbed the watch and fled toward some nearby apartments, Bosshart said.

Later that afternoon, the victim searched on Craigslist to see if he could find his watch — and did. Bosshart said the photos in the new ad were the same images the victim had used in his original ad — including a photo of the watch’s individually numbered back plate.

The victim contacted the new seller — who was advertising a new selling price of $7,000 — and arranged to buy the watch, then contacted Carpentersville police.

The victim and the seller then arranged to meet at a local fast-food restaurant, and when Bonds and Miller showed up they were arrested, police said. Bonds had the watch on him when he was arrested, police said.

Bonds was later charged with theft of the laptop on Dec. 10. According to Bosshart, a Hoffman Estates man told police he had listed the computer on Craigslist and agreed to meet the buyer at Dundee-Crown High School. When he arrived, a man later identified as Bonds grabbed the computer and ran, police said.

The victim used software loaded onto the computer to find its location and take pictures of where it was, Bosshart said. The information led police to a computer repair shop near Spring Hill Mall, police said.

An employee there told police he bought the computer from Miller for $405. It had listed on Craigslist for $1,650.

Miller’s bail was set at $30,000, and Bonds’ bail was set at $15,000. Both were given Jan. 9 court dates.
