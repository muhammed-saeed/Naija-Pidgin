Dissertation Conclusion - Logistics

 
 Conclusion 

             

 With the continuously tighter global market competition , companies are increasingly focusing on their 
operations to gain market leadership and thus increase profitability. In many organizations—and 
at many business schools—the boundaries between operations and other functional 
areas is rigid and nearly impenetrable. Yet as competition heats up and cost-cutting pressures mount, corporations are demanding that all functional 
areas in the organization work together to bring products and services to market 
quickly and cost-effectively. As business sharpens its focus on productivity and 
cost control, the future belongs to those companies that can integrate 3PL practices , operations management theory and practice throughout their 
enterprise. Recent experience shows that even huge companies are feeling the 
need to be able to move quickly in the competitive arena. Decentralized organization structures can enhance the quality of such decisions, while 
also providing higher managers a greater opportunity to pursue strategic 
planning. Technological improvements in product design, resource planning 
software, and manufacturing itself also reduce the time it takes to institute 
strategic changes. 

 The field of operations management is multifaceted, both in an organizational and in a 
technical sense. It is especially complex if one intends to exploit the full 
potential of integral optimization along the entire value chain from procurement to the final customer. Such a complex field 
requires sophisticated analysis with sound theoretical foundations. In practice, 
however, clever strategic analyses will only be successfully realized if they 
are embedded in a sound approach to the process of strategy formulation and implementation. In view of the many process-related 
shortcomings in logistic practice , it is essential that effective techniques are used to 
overcome these shortcomings. This, however, is not sufficient. In the long run 
the major challenge in developing a successful operations strategy may well lie 
in achieving a synergetic combination of both rigorous technical analysis and 
effective process facilitation. The high degree of internationalization in 
logistic management (increasingly, even for smaller firms) has certain 
implications for managers. A logistic practitioner can become more valuable by 
developing the skills necessary for conducting business in a variety of 
settings. These would contain language skills and a certain amount of flexibility, understanding, and 
resourcefulness in dealing with different cultures, as well as more developed 
decision-making skills needed in handling difficult circumstances with limited, 
imperfect information. 

 From the results of the investigations in this project, there 
are different reasons revealed why there are changes happening in the business 
industry. Actually, a number of strategies have been applied and implemented in 
order to improve organizations’ logistics. Specifically, the increasing 
globalization trend as well as the relevant increase of business competition 
encouraged a number of firms to integrate logistics into their corporate 
strategies so as to obtain both service and cost benefits.    

 Basically, the results of the research reveal the importance 
of supply chain management aspects in the businesses in Shanghai, China. To be 
particular, the surveyed subjects were asked about their company’s standards in 
adapting effective logistic practices. According to the results, SCM in 
accordance to logistic practices is very important management tool and business 
strategy for the businesses. Actually, the surveyed respondents believe that 
businesses in Shanghai, China is moving very fast, product life cycle is getting 
short and competition is very keen. 

 Essentially, selection of supply is the most vital function 
of the management since the process crucially influences the supplier’s 
organization. It wields direct bearing in terms of the resources’ price, 
quality, reliability, and availability. These elements determine the level of 
contentment of the customers with regards to the products. Thus, selection and 
evaluation of supply are of significant importance in the operations of small 
and large organizations. 

 In connection to these, most of the surveyed subjects also 
believed that their respective companies are initiating outsourcing strategies. 
Actually, some of them said that they are using outsourcing strategy for both 
logistics (use 3PL) and manufacturing (use EMS) functions since outsourcing can 
support their business growth by using less investment as they can shared the 
risk with their suppliers (i.e. EMS). In addition, companies of OEM can focus on 
R&amp;D, design and brand management rather than the details operations since it is 
good for their companies to have better ROI and they can easily manage the 
inertial resources as well. Actually, the other reasons regarding the practice 
of outsourcing operation strategy is its significant savings. It is not only 
talking about the dollar saving but also the overall resources as well as 
time-to market performances. 

 The shifting business world let customers to transform as 
well. Business management had shifted their focus on their clients or customers 
so as to stay productively in business with the need to entirely reformulate 
their usual business aims and purposes from being process-focused to 
customer-cantered. With the introduction of technological development, 
logistical practices concerning delivery processes, stockholding, warehousing 
and economies of scale get more multifaceted solutions in current’s dealing 
environment. Certainly, making a business successful in a picky setting demands 
vital and detailed studies and assessment of the factors that will create the 
best results that will serve the aims and objectives of the business. Taking 
benefit of the opportunities and escalating the strengths while minimizing the 
risks and weaknesses of a business firm greatly helps in predicting the success 
in business enterprise. 

   

 The finest product and service providers incessantly update 
and improve their service deliveries in order to respond the demands of their 
clients. Clients have the ever-increasing demand on getting their hands into the 
products which can lead to modify in business organization if expectations are 
not met. As industry leaders, owners of a chain of small retail outlet stores 
trend toward more reliable delivery services across their customers for 
efficient product and service distribution. However, problems of delivery and 
distribution are usually attended by most companies with either quick fixes that 
do not work or complete and comprehensive delivery and distribution designs that 
take too long and are expensive. Examination on the business strategies and 
plans in order to answer to the demands of clients and customers through 
efficient delivery of such needs will not only increase the profit of an 
organization but will likewise gain the trust and competence of the clients and 
customers. Efficient management of delivery options in a certain business and 
looking into the problems encountered in working the business may enhance the 
likelihood of a business corporation to attain its goals as enterprising 
organization. 

 As stated 3PL is also demand-driven wherein daily requirements trigger immediate receipts. It 
is a logistic program according to the daily demands of raw materials and 
finished goods and a buffer to demand variability through faster data exchange 
and consignment stock. The company, in utilizing the 3PL , 
should have high purchasing volume coverage to avail significant inventory 
savings, has relatively stable demand from customers to make use the forecast 
data, has a single supplier for a specific material to avoid inefficient 
transactions and currently has high day of supply level. 3PL simplifies the supply chain of an enterprise between domestic or overseas 
manufacturers and suppliers to rethink; re-engineer and redefine their supply 
chain relationship in today’s competitive and fast-paced economic business 
world.
