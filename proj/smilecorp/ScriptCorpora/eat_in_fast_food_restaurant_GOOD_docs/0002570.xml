Description

In the mid-90s, while studying at Harvard Business School, Pasha&apos;s CEO Antonio Ellek came up with the concept of a healthful Mediterranean fast-food restaurant. And in 2003, with the help of classmate Nicolas Cortes, the first location for this homegrown chain sprouted on Lincoln Road. Since then, seven other Pash&apos;s have blossomed and flourished throughout South Florida. Each offers customers inexpensive, fresh, daily-prepared meals free of preservatives, additives, trans fats, and MSG. The menu offers a wide array of street foods from the Levant, or the eastern Mediterranean countries of Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Israel, and Egypt. Try the gyros, both chicken and the more traditional beef ($6.95), or the vegetarian favorite, falafel ($3.95). The best items here are the pides ($6.95 to $9.95): soft, thin-crusted, individual-size pizzas baked to order and topped with ingredients varying from grilled mushrooms to chicken. It&apos;s difficult to find a cheaper, more healthful meal option anywhere else in town.

2005 | BEST HEALTHY FAST FOOD 

BEST HEALTHY FAST FOOD Pasha&apos;s Various locations in Miami-Dade County www.pashas.com Fast food has always been about unhealthy choices. Still is for the most part, but nowadays McSalad chains such as Fresh Salads and Baja Fresh Mexican are yielding fresh profits from gullible dieters. Please pardon our skepticism over the notion of iceberg lettuce, white rice, and Snapple being salubrious. We don&apos;t kid ourselves into thinking Pasha&apos;s Mediterranean menu of fried falafels, meaty kebabs, or... More» 
 
2004 | BEST FALAFEL 

The chickpea is to Middle Eastern cuisine what plantains are to Caribbean food. Dietary staple and base ingredient for foundation foods such as hummus and falafel, this lowly, bland legume soaks up flavor like a sponge, and finds exquisite expression when mashed, spiced, fried, and mixed with vegetables and tahini in Pasha&apos;s falafel wrap. It&apos;s healthy and cheap ($3.50 for a substantial portion) and Pasha&apos;s will bring it to you, provided you live within range of its Miami Beach, Brickell... More»
