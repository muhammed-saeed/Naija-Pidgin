 Tips If you&apos;re watching your weight, you&apos;ll have to be careful with the takeout food. Limit your consumption of burgers and French fries, for example, and steer yourself toward low-fat meats like chicken. If that chicken is deep-fried, though, your best move is to peel the skin off before you eat. 
 Want a quick picnic? You don&apos;t have to slave over the stove for hours to fill that picnic basket. Instead, drop by a fast-food restaurant for takeout food. Some restaurants, especially chicken places, will gladly provide you with extras like mashed potatoes and gravy and cole slaw for a little more money. 
 When ordering takeout food for delivery, write down your entire order before you call. That way, you won’t forget anything, and you won&apos;t tie up the restaurant&apos;s phone for too long. This is especially important when you&apos;re ordering for a group.
