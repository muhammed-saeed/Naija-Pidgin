Online Travelers

The internet is the world&apos;s greatest travel 
portal. Customers now surf the globe from home in search of the perfect 
holiday and hospitality providers have to work hard to match their 
expectations online.

The proliferation of web based travel 
portals, combined with easy access to online photos and video clips 
means travelers can now pay a virtual visit to their planned holiday 
destination before they ever leave the house. Beach view wallpapers 
decorate computer screens in offices and homes around the world and 
destination websites receive millions of hits every day. The internet 
has become an essential tool when comes to planning holidays or business
 trips with most people now booking flights, hotels, hire cars, even 
restaurants online. This has had a profound effect on the marketing 
strategies and even the service concepts offered by many hospitality 
based businesses.

Trip Advisor® is perhaps one of the most 
significant additions to the international travel landscape in the last 
10 years and for selected groups of connected friends, Twitter® is also 
becoming a personalised guide to the globe. A few years ago, very few 
hotels or holiday homes would have considered starting their own 
Facebook® page or You Tube® channel, but today&apos;s traveller relies 
increasingly rely on video and social media when making accommodation 
choices, so marketing departments have no choice but to keep pace.

So
 how do people actually use these travel sites and online media portals?
 Do they believe every recommendation they read? Will they book for two 
weeks based on a nice photo? Research suggests the process is generally 
much more involved with people using a combination of online resources 
to make their choices, collecting valuable snippets along the way and 
balancing opinion with facts. Marc Ribail is Chief Operating Officer at 
Samui Villas and Homes, a highly successful private villa management and
 rental firm based in Koh Samui,Thailand. He believes that today&apos;s 
travellers research their destination and accommodation choices 
thoroughly, especially at the high end of the market.&quot;Details are 
important with so much information available online,&quot;he said.&quot;The web 
gives people the freedom to tick all the boxes. By looking online at our
 photos and video clips, potential guests can check whether the villa is
 child friendly, they can see the ocean views from every room and even 
confirm the length of the swimming pool. This not only helps them choose
 the right property, it also helps us because most guests know what to 
expect in advance of their arrival.&quot;

Of course, visuals are 
not always the acid test when it comes to travel. As anyone who&apos;s 
ordered from a fast food restaurant will tell you, the photos on the 
menu rarely match the food on the plate. With web designers now skilled 
in image manipulation, a picture can hide a thousand unwritten words. 
But then there&apos;s always text and word of mouth. The internet is awash 
with comprehensive descriptions, personal recommendations, holiday snaps
 and video records, the only problem being that on balance they tend to 
cancel each other out. A cursory glance through the average Trip 
Advisor® list often leaves you torn between booking immediately and 
writing a letter of complaint in advance, and with a world of eclectic 
tastes to consider, one man&apos;s palace may be another man&apos;s dungeon.

Just
 like the search engines, clever web marketing professionals now monitor
 user activity in order to match visitors&apos; expectations. Armed with the 
knowledge that travellers want valuable information, honesty, and images
 that actually tell them something, they increasingly focus on detail, 
using the web to offer an informative overview of their products and 
services.&quot;If you offer quality, there&apos;s nothing to hide,&quot;continued 
Ribail.&quot;The web lays your cards on the table and if you try to deceive 
people, you&apos;ll be found out for sure.&quot;
