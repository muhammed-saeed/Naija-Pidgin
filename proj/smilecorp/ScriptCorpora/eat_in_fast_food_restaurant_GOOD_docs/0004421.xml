 October 11, 2010 Likes it Very tasty by Armywife ( 223 reviews ) Surprisingly I really like this place. The hubs is the biggest fan of Qdoba, and we walked in here I wanted to leave. I thought it was going to be another Qdoba, which I hate. But we were there, he was excited to try it, so I went ahead and picked something off the menu. Chicken quesadilla with chips and queso. Their chips are awesome, and their queso tastes homemade. It&apos;s very different, and we both loved it. The quesadilla was awesome and what made it better was that I was able to add in some grilled onions with extra cheese and as many side veggies as I wanted!! Lots of lettuce and pico! Hubs loved what he got and we&apos;ve been back a couple of times, and will continue to return. July 26, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it High prices and bad morale by Kristin ( 50 reviews ) I went in with a coupon for a buy one entree get one free only to find a big sign saying the coupon was printed wrong and that to honor the coupon you also had to purchase 2 drinks. I LOVED the fish tacos but what aggravated me the most was that the menus did not include PRICES! I&apos;m on a budget and ordering blindly with a mystery bill is not up my alley. It was quite expensive for what we got even with a coupon. You could eat for the same price at a much better Mexican sit down restaurant. December 6, 2011 Didn&apos;t like it.... by Corey Mullins ( 1 review ) Tried today for the first time. Thinking it was similar to Qudoba, not at all. I ordered a chicken burrito with sweet rice, black beans, pico,&quot;hot sauce&quot;, maybe a few others. Hot sauce was no where near hot, chips tasted as if served by a bar, had a bad cooking grease taste. Did have a hint of lime which the employee, after my asking about lime salt or similar, said they did not use. Shredded chicken tasted like it had been there a while. Very watery, no flavor. The choice of toppings did not create any sort of culinary experience in my mouth, they all ran together and wasn&apos;t able to individually taste each item. The pineapple salsa had a burnt flavor to it. Thought it would be a unique item never tried, better off going down to Kroger and purchasing their brand. Overall, I was unable to taste that authentic fresh taste. I&apos;ll stick with Qudoba, thanks for a 10 meal that tasted like a 4. Or better yet just head over to Roscoe&apos;s.

To add I kind of felt uncomfortable when it came to purchasing my meal. There was a tip portion on the receipt and a basket of money. I do not see it necessary to tip the person preparing my food. There wasn&apos;t a service provided that required a tip. They are there to make a product that they profit from, without them no sell. I appreciate this, just not a need to tip. Do you tip at Subway, McDonalds, or any other&quot;fast food&quot;restaurant? Felt a bit uncomfortable....... July 24, 2011 Likes it All I can say is Yummmm by Matt ( 2 reviews ) If you want real flavor and several choices, this is where you need to go...NOT the other places that seem to use less quality products from a can. August 18, 2010 Likes it Tasty Goodness by CSY ( 5 reviews ) This follows the Subway model where you order food and walk down an array of choices to customize your meal. It&apos;s high-end fast food, I suppose. The best and most original entrée is the Chicken Green Chile Quesadilla. The sauté chicken&amp;onions in a sweet green chile sauce when you order. It&apos;s very tasty. I get mine with black beans and sweet rice for a great meal. I get the quesadilla with salsa verde, which they call mild sauce. Chips and queso are great. The chips are very light and delicate. The queso is white cheese based and smooth. March 4, 2010 Likes it Happy to return. by Sondra A. ( 1 review ) As a new restaurant, the Bajio Mexican Grill had its faults. But WOW it&apos;s my new favorite place. The menu is simple to read. The food is obviously fresh, as I watched them cook it and then put it directly on the line for service. There is a lot of options for you to choose how you want your meal to be, but don&apos;t let that scare you. They will let you sample nearly everything to see if you like it. So if you haven&apos;t been you need to go, if you have gone, you need to go back. July 12, 2009 Mobile review by Nick Farr ( 1 review ) Great food, nice people! Awesome nachos!!
