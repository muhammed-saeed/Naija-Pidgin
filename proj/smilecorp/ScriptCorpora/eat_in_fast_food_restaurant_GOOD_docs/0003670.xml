flame: GET THIS GARBAGE OFF THE NET!!!, one to flame the flamer,
one to ask to be removed from the news group, one to ask for a
copy of the last message :-) , and one to ask how to unROT the
joke.
2. Fifty - One to do it and 49 to talk about it on net.bulbs.d.
Note: a nice try, but there&apos;s no such group. [1]alt.fan.lightbulbs
is quite active, though - BRIAN.

How many rec.humor.funny readers does it take to screw in a light
bulb?
50. They all stand out in the hall while Maddi comes out every once in
a while and looks at all the light bulbs people have brought. Finally
she selects a few. They&apos;re all quite feeble and burn out after a few
minutes, so she comes out for more. But she selects more dim bulbs,
which causes great discontent among the people who have brought really
bright, long-lasting bulbs.

How many rec.humour posters does it take to change a light bulb ?
31. One to change the light bulb and thirty to flame them for picking
the wrong wattage. No, better make that 32 ... Captain Nitpick will
want to point out that the newsgroup is rec.humor (US spelling) not
rec.humour.

How many rec.humor readers does it take to change a light bulb?
1. 100-one to announce that it burned out, 10 to agree, 20 to come
running in with new light bulbs and screw them in, 9 to screw them
in and leave the old bulb in, 10 to ask for a videotape of the
screwing, another one to come in a few minutes later and notice
the bulb went out again and start the whole process all over
again. And one (me!) to notice that this doesn&apos;t actually add up
to 100.
2. 1000. And they change the same bulb over and over and over again
and still no one notices it&apos;s been changed so they change it again
and again and then they even discuss it and then someone flames
them for not doing it in rec.humor.d.
3. 565. 1 to put in a trick bulb (say, a flash bulb), 6 to flame the
first, pointing out that this bulb is different from the old one,
29 to counter-flame, pointing out that the new bulb is
deliberately different, and is parodying the old one, 7 to leave
the room, citing the extreme density of the 6, 12 to demand that
this commentary be redirected to the other room, 14 to ask that
the bulb be changed again, since they missed seeing it the first
time, and 496 (a bit excessive, but it&apos;s not my joke) to climb all
over each other, trying to put the old bulb back in.
4. An infinitely growing number : - One to announce that the bulb
burned out. Ten to agree. One to change it, one to post in saying
&quot;I got it&quot;, one to post in saying &quot;Yes, but they have shots for it
nowadays&quot;, one to post in saying &quot;Our news software hasn&apos;t been
working and I missed the original light bulb joke. Would someone
please post it again or email it to me?&quot;, one to post in quoting
everything so far and the words &quot;Me too&quot;, two to turn it into a
cascade, another ten to build the cascade into a disk-wasting
monster, one to post in with &quot;I don&apos;t get it. Isn&apos;t this the place
for FUNNY jokes?&quot;, one to post in after two months &quot;What&apos;s this
light bulb joke you&apos;re all talking about?&quot;, one to repost it a
month later thinking it&apos;s a new joke, one to post &quot;I didn&apos;t get
it. What&apos;s the punchline?&quot;, one to post &quot;Has anyone got a list of
these? I&apos;m starting a list, so please send me all your light bulb
jokes&quot;, and one to cross-post the joke to alt.fan.lightbulbs 6
months later prefixed by &quot;Are we allowed to tell jokes in here?&quot;
and accompanied by all of our old favourites like &quot;How many
programmers...? None that&apos;s a hardware problem.&quot;, three to ask, a
month later, &quot;What FTP sites are the old light bulbs archived
at?&quot;, and any number to revive the entire exchange at stochastic
intervals of two to six months.

How many alt.fan.pratchett readers does it take to change a light
bulb?
Four. One to actually change the bulb, one to write amusing footnotes
about it, one to propose to Laura, and a newbie to ask if that&apos;s
really THE Terry Or colette or both, and then to realise that the
speed of light can&apos;t be measured, except in badgers, or possibly
multiple of pi, then to say sod it and ask if anyone knows where to
find the lyrics for the hedgehog song...

(Note : The last 3 all refer to personalities in the rec.humor group.)

a software bug.
4. Eleven. One to ask to be on the light bulb gif mailing list, nine
to say &quot;ME TOO!&quot;, and another to post a message asking for the
intructions on how to view a light bulb.
Note: If you don&apos;t beleive me, see the
alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels,
alt.binaries.pictures.celebreties, and alt.sex newsgroups and you
will see threads up to 10 &quot;ME TOO!&quot;s long consisting of all
AOL&apos;ers requesting to be put on non exisitent .gif/ftp mailing
lists. Internet folklore tells us that all the gits are on AOL.
The software they&apos;re using is only partly to blame.

How many VEGAN-L subscribers does it take to change a light bulb?

about then?&quot;, one to post &quot;I dunno, it sounds like some kind of food&quot;,
one to post &quot;In that case, has anyone got a recipe for one then?&quot;, one
to post in requesting Michael Traub look up and tell us all its B12
content, one to post &quot;Will it help cure my auntie&apos;s arthritis?&quot;, one
to assert that it probably won&apos;t, but its effectiveness at this might
well be increased by accompanying it with some shiatsu and meditation,
two to condemn that as too unscientific, one to ask whether light
bulbs are totally vegan, one to post &quot;Read the FAQ&quot;, one assert that
they are and add &quot;I like light bulbs. They&apos;re low in fat, and stay
crunchy in soya milk too !&quot;, one to announce that she&apos;s leaving the
list unless the discussion gets a bit more meaningful, three to post
in reassuring her that eventually it will, Lissa Mosley to post that
the list moderators feel they must respectfully request that the
discussion be moved to private email as it has been going on far too
long, one to agree with this and add &quot;So what has all this got to do
with ethical veg*nism anyway?&quot; and suggest the discussion be moved to
alt.fan.lightbulbs , and one to post in quoting this suggestion and
add &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;. So the discussion moves to usenet, as our intrepid
vegan-l subscribers venture beyond the boundaries of email, and
alt.fan.lightbulbs finds itself taking a few days off from the &quot;My
incredible light&quot; and &quot;Light Bulb death&quot; discussions and come up with
some new jokes...

started unzipping his pants...

something about how light bulbs are so masculine to the group, two to
post in disagreeing with this, Susan Macran to post &quot;Bog off stumpy!&quot;,
a whole terminal room in Keele to sit there discussing it only among
themselves, one to post a coherent critique of Susan Macran&apos;s last
post, Kate Smith to complain that the women always get flamed more
than the men, Menya to say that light bulbs are sexy as long as
they&apos;re orange and could someone bring her a nice hot one, and two

How many light bulb jokes does it take to change a light bulb joke?
Hmmmm - the probability that a given light bulb joke will be submitted
to the net in any given week is .4, and the probability that it will
have changed detectably since the last transmission is .2 . Hence
(assuming independence, which is reasonable since no submitter of a
light bulb joke ever seems to know it has been submitted before,
within the last 2 or 3 weeks), the probability that it will change in
a given week is .08. So it takes about 12.5 light bulb jokes to change

exactly twice as many as are currently available. If they are host
programmers, it takes one for each variant of Unix and/or
MicroSoft Windows. If they are core programmers, it only takes
one. He just holds the bulb to the socket and waits for the world
to revolve around him.
3. One to analyze the historical failure rates of light bulbs using
PROC LIFEREG, so as to anticipate the failure of the light bulb
before the user actually has to report it, one to explain why SAS
is better for changing light bulbs than S-Plus, SPSS/X, BMDP,

in AF/SCL allowing the user to manually request the changing of
the light bulb after its failure (prematurely) occurs, one to

try to get them to explain when a new version of the light bulb
will ship, how much we&apos;ll pay to keep using light bulbs for
another year, and what we&apos;ll do if our site sends all its light
bulbs to Europe where 120V/60Hz light bulbs tend to explode upon
insertion in 220V/50Hz circuits, one to write an incomprehensible
ten line SAS macro program which will perpetually insert new
filaments into all mission critical light bulbs until its author
is fired, at which point the SAS macro will automatically encode
itself into a copy of the latest SAS/ETS usage notes, one to write
a graphical front end to the light bulb changing process using
SAS/EIS, with little speedometers showing the number of light
bulbs changed per hour, so that management can understand why we
need to buy bigger light bulbs, one to prepare a SUGI paper
summarizing the entire light bulb project, taking credit for the
design and execution of the light bulb project itself as well as
the invention of the light bulb itself, another one to prepare a
second SUGI paper benchmarking light bulb replacement on twelve
different types of light sockets, with separate graphs for

the titling, axes, color, polylines, and background, which were
all added manually with Cricket Graph on a Mac), ten to push the
dollie loaded with SAS/Light Bulb manuals, and, One more to ask
SAS-L for help when you really need to change that bulb, now.
4. Zero. We have the housekeeping staff do it for us.
5. Please let us know!
6. That depends; what color is the bulb?
7. It all depends on whether they can read the manuals or not. That
needs to be in there somewhere as a qualifier!
8. They can&apos;t change light bulbs... Without light, they can&apos;t read
the manual, and without the manual, they can&apos;t figure out how to
change the light bulb.
9. This can not be computed. Changing light bulbs is a hardware
problem...
10. Two. One to change the light bulb and one to make sure the stack
of manuals doesn&apos;t tip over.
11. One, once the documentation for the procedure is found in one of
the 15 manuals on the shelf.
12. Well, it depends upon the platform on which one stands!
13. Actually none, if you are willing to close your eyes to the
(validity of the) output.
14. It can&apos;t be done yet. &quot;Light bulb&quot; is more than 8 characters long.

Twelve. Crusty #1 yanks the old bulb out and crusty #2 is just about
to put the new one in when crusties #3 and #4 stagger in and start
arguing that it&apos;s their turn. In the ensuing squabble the bulb gets
dropped on the floor and smashes. Then crusty #5 points out what a
good laugh this is and so chief crusty (#6) dispatches crusties #7 and
#8 to go down the shops to buy a new one. After having visited at
least 2 off licences on the way, they find their way into the hardware
shop. While crusty #7 is busily trying to buy 6 new bulbs for the
princely sum of 10p each and a can of special brew, crusty #8 is busy
liberating as many as will fit into his long grey shapeless overcoat&apos;s
pockets. They are joined on the way back by crusties #9 and #10 whose
names they&apos;ve forgotten but they do at least sound familiar, and much
frivolous hugging ensues until someone remembers what the trip down
the shops was all about. On their way back into the squat they pass
crusty #11, who has only just joined the group, and who is just on his
way out to go and get his hair crimped. Anyway once inside, the light
bulbs are all smashed on the floor and the stereo is cranked up so the
dancing can begin. At this point crusty #12 comes back in from a
Levellers gig and collapses in a corner, only to find he is lying on
something that makes a noise, which turns out to be the dog, holding
the last unsmashed light bulb in its mouth.

as I&apos;ve ever seen, just barks and barks and barks ... :-/

Two, of course. One stands at one end of the room and argues that it
isn&apos;t dark; the other stands across from him and says that true light
is impossible. This dialectic creates a synthesis when the bulb gets
screwed in.

answers to seemingly mutual exclusive positions. Shortened it is

arrive at a middle ground through logical examination &apos;it&apos;s dark but
it can be made light&apos;.

possible.

light bulb?
Many hands make light work.

one, so it makes a nice play on words.

Sorry, light bulbs are an evolutionary dead end.
Note: It might be something to do with the film - 2001 Space Odyssey.
It&apos;s more the book, actually. That and &quot;The Lost Worlds of 2001&quot;

the books, are meant to help man evolve, something sort of hinted at
in the film but more explicitly stated in the books.

impossible to prove things.)

above joke is based.

punchline to another joke entirely.

(I guess the point is that spies like to do everything in the dark
anyway?)

sessions were as described in the punchline.

None. The darkness will cause the light bulb to change by itself.

Thatcherites were more extreme). They believed that if they shifted
the focus of government economic policy to stimulating supply rather
than demand, the business cycle would be stopped at an agreeable point
and inflation would be permanently whipped. Obviously, it didn&apos;t quite
work out that way.

theorist who is very influential with literary critics at the moment.
This relates to his theories.

None, but you lose a lot of light bulbs.
Note: None because gypsies don&apos;t have mains electricity, and the

Gypsy a light bulb and ask him to change the hallway lamp, pretty soon
you have one less light bulb and the hallway lamp is still out.

provocation.

Two: One to screw it in real good, and one to call the proctologist.

reference to a supposed homosexual practice of putting foreign objects
in each others&apos; rectums. Perhaps &quot;marginal&quot; is some regional insulting
term for some kind of male homosexual?

things falling out of trees...)

first place, ten to decide to remodel the house as long as they&apos;re
changing the bulb...

1. Er, two. Or maybe one. No - on second thoughts, make that two. Is
that okay with you?
2. Why change the bulb? Isn&apos;t it more romantic in the dark?
3. Well gee, I don&apos;t know really. I guess it depends on the bulb and
where it burned out. It might perhaps take just one if it&apos;s just
an ordinary bulb, but maybe two if the person doesn&apos;t know where
to find a new light bulb, or...

How many [8]Scorpios does it take to change a light bulb?

Note as submitted: The francophones in Quebec are hell-bent on

need is &quot;50% plus one&quot; meaning anything greater than 50% of the
vote. So the anglophones in Quebec, and the people in the rest of
Canada think it&apos;s funny. There is some resentment between the two
groups.
