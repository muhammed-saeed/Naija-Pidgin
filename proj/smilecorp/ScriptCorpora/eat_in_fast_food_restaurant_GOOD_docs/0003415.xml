This place is a great Silver Spring hang-out. Wine is a little over-priced, but they have a monopoly on the cool wine bar market. Food is good. Burgers are the best on the menu.

Don&apos;t miss the eggplant fries. seriously.

Location
The restaurant is in the heart of Downtown Silver Spring, easily accessible by Metro and car.  The Fenton Street parking garage is right across the street.  It&apos;s a little hidden if you aren&apos;t looking closely.  It sits next to Whole Foods and Baja Fresh (which are more noticeable due to their signage) and behind the large pavilion (summer)/ice skating rink (winter) area.

Atmosphere
Part wine store, part café, with light wood furnishings, it reminds me of some of the wine stores at vineyards I have visited in Napa Valley.  Very clean inside.  Casual atmosphere.

Service
The cashier and cooks all seemed very polite and courteous.  They were also very knowledgeable in wine.  I am the self-proclaimed &quot;wino&quot; in my group of friends.  I had some friends with me who did not know what kind of wine to try and the staff gave great recommendations; all but one had a wine that they enjoyed.

Food
The food was very delicious and budget-friendly!  We ordered the cheese sampler block (came with three different cheeses, bread, and a delicious jelly preserve) and the calamari.  I didn&apos;t expect such good calamari from a small place like this.

Now, this isn&apos;t Napa Valley or Italy, but for the wine enthusiast, you will be pleased with the concept.  (And there are soft drinks for the non-wine drinkers).  This is a great place OUTSIDE of the city (with free, easy to find parking) that&apos;s casual, budget-friendly, and overall a cute place to go.  It is highly recommended and would definitely return!

A fab local business option in downtown Silver Spring.

I&apos;m a big fan of the Jerk Chicken Salad, Lobster Bisque, and Half &apos;n Half fries.

YUMMY 8)

Adega&apos;s staff is very friendly and the dining area is always clean. Nice place for a date or out-of-town visitors.

The sweet potato fries are DELICIOUS!!! I had their Jerk wrap and was pleased. I was a bit disappointed the wrap had all of the lettuce and the chicken on one side. Then again I am a bit picky, hey I don&apos;t like turning my wrap around and around to get the equal amount of fixings. My husband has had their Jalisco and Bison Burger and has loved them.

This place def needs more seating. Staff was friendly.

This is a go-to for casual gatherings. The food is fresh and tasty, and the atmosphere is relaxed. It&apos;s an added bonus that you can choose your wine from the shelf and have it with dinner instead of staring at a nondescript wine menu and wondering what you&apos;re ordering. Now, if oly you could have your wine outside here...

Came here with my boyfriend on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon. We wanted a place to hang out before grabbing dinner. So we grabbed some reading material, said yes to the wine tasting, and bought a bottle of red to share. We sat down, enjoyed a glass of wine, and read.

Great set up -- love the concept. Wish there were more places like this in other cities. Makes drinking wine and hanging out very affordable. Please note that we didn&apos;t eat anything here... but for the concept, the space to enjoy wine, hang out, and talk, read, etc, I would definitely recommend.

Adega is a solid 3.  The food here is reliably pretty good.  I have been there enough to sample burgers, several kinds of sandwiches and a few salads.  Some are great--the burgers are all tasty, for instance.  The sandwiches are a bit more hit and miss.  Some are awesome, others bland or poorly made.  The sweet potato fries are always tasty--definitely upgrade from the chips.

The store is occasionally quite crowded, and the seating situation is first come, first serve.  The tables are frequently a bit dirty too--they need more regular bussing.

In all, Adega is a solid choice in a convenient location.  Definitely not the best grub in downtown Silver Spring, but you won&apos;t regret it if you find yourself there.

Despite the three stars, I really like something about this spot.  The menu descriptions read much better than the food actually tastes, that I will say.

I&apos;ve had a few of the sandwiches, the hummus, and the sweet potato fries.  Quite frankly, everything is just ok, but something about the ambience and the nice casual feel of the spot just works well with a relaxed meetup with a friend.  It&apos;s also nice to be able to enjoy a bottle of wine at retail cost with no corking fee.

I had eaten here several years ago and never returned.  I&apos;m pretty sure that was due to not being impressed with the food.  I would recommend the owners check out the menu of Cafe Tu O Tu in Georgetown and try and emulate fare along the lines of that.  Still relatively inexpensive, but tasty.

With some improvement on the food, I have no doubt this would be a minimum of four stars here on Yelp, but yet currently a three star which is not so hot.  I tend to not be inclined to try any business below a 3.5.

The eggplant fries are amazing.  So delicious.  They come with marinara sauce, and the small order was plenty.  They have a great wine selection (and you can buy bottles of wine while you&apos;re waiting for your food!) and a decent beer selection too.

They don&apos;t have servers, you order at the register, they give you your beverage of choice and then you wait for your food.  It was a little slow when I was there, so minus one star.

I was not a fan of this place. We went in for lunch the other day and both of our sandwiches were pretty crappy. I&apos;m wondering if we just didn&apos;t order the right thing because folks on here seem to really be into this place.

The sandwich I had was just not good, really dry and I feel like the bbq sauce and rosemary foccacia shouldn&apos;t ever be served together.  I would go back to try the pizza or these french fries that yelpers are over the moon for, but I&apos;m not really in a rush. Also, 2 draught beers and 2 sandwiches put us well over $30. The food was way too mediocre for those prices.

The BF and I are big fans of casual wine shops that serve up food.  We&apos;d much rather go to a laid-back wine shop for an enjoyable happy hour than go to some random bar that&apos;s overflowing with people and serving up crappy drinks.

While Adega had a great atmosphere and good wine, the food left much to be desired.  We both ordered burgers, which while perfectly acceptable, were not anything special.  &quot;A-Ok&quot; is actually the perfect word to describe them.

If I happen to find myself up in Silver Spring during happy hour again, I might pay Adega another visit, but it&apos;s definitely not a place I&apos;d go out of my way to visit.

A little less than 3.5 stars - Good fried fast food with easy access to wine and booze.  Not a restaurant though.  You order at the counter and pick up your food.  I expected a sit down restaurant.  It looks much nicer outside then it is inside.  We went for happy hour and got 20% off the delicious fattyness of eggplant fries, bbq sliders, and fried calamari.  I would shy away from the lackluster mini burger. The wines by the bottle are inexpensive, but the ambiance is part wine store, part above average fast food restaurant. Not the best ambiance for the product but the food makes up for it.

Food is hit or miss here, but the eggplant fries are to die for.  The Jerk Chicken Wrap is also delightful.

Good selection of wine and beer, but I&apos;ve found better value elsewhere.

Great atmosphere and I love that it&apos;s an independent business in the chain-infested world that is Downtown Silver Spring.

They also have a frequent diner card, though I&apos;m not sure of the details... I always forget mine, unfortunately!

For drivers - there are two garages that are quite close to Adega/DTSS area.

In a few months I&apos;ll be moving across the line into DC after nine years in Silver Spring.  As the date for my departure looms closer, I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about the places in Silver Spring that I will rarely, or perhaps never, visit again.  Adega is not worth traveling any great distance to eat at.  Furthermore, there are a few duds on the menu - the BBQ pork sandwich is mediocre at best, the smoked salmon wrap just doesn&apos;t come together very well, and the Jerk chicken sandwich always seems to be dry, overcooked, and lacking much in the way of jerk flavor.

However, Adega also has many excellent stand outs.  Honestly, if they served nothing besides their amazing (and quite filling) fish tacos, I&apos;d give the place three stars.  The things end up being a mess if you let them sit too long, but all in all, they may be the best fish tacos I&apos;ve ever had.  The large pieces of cod are grilled (not fried) and the citrus slaw and papaya salsa are both unique and delicious.  Their take on a turkey reuben is also unique, featuring havarti cheese, wine reduced sauerkraut and asian pear cranberry chutney.  It&apos;s not &quot;light&quot; in any sense but it is delicious.  Sadly, they seem to have dropped their French Dip, which was one of the best versions I&apos;ve ever had of that old (and usually tired) standby.  Their bistro steak sandwich is okay when they overcook the steak and excellent when they nail it - I tend to ask for rare which usually ensures slices of steak closer to my liking, but YMMV.  I also recommend the blackened ahi tuna wrap and the field green salad.  And yes...they do indeed make THE BEST sweet potato fries I&apos;ve ever had.

Wine selection is quite good, if not over whelming, and on mondays and wednesdays they have some good &quot;wine+meal&quot; deals that can make for a tasty and relatively inexpensive date night.  Like I said earlier, this is not a destination location, but it&apos;s the kind of local place that any neighborhood should be thrilled to have as part of the community.  Now that I think about it, there&apos;s a very good chance that those fish tacos will lure me back here occasionally even after moving to the District.

I like this place.  It&apos;s that simple!  Its like when Panera meets Wine menu.

It&apos;s casual, inexpensive, the food is tasty (holler at the eggplant fries), and there is a mini wine store inside (that&apos;s also inexpensive)!  If you catch it on a good night (generally Friday) they&apos;ll have wine tastings.  The menu never changes. LOL.  Great spot for a vegetarian.  I like their salads and soups... and of course their wine.

I don&apos;t like that you have to bus your own tables, because not everyone cleans up after themselves so well.  The restrooms are LIMITED and every time I go, it&apos;s like mad packed... and it never seems freshly cleaned.

There&apos;s outdoor seating but guess what?  Drinking the good stuff is only allowed indoors!  Makes sense but it kind of blows.

Cute date spot, or after the movie spot, or grab something not so fancy spot, or ust because spot.... hope you like it.

I still love this place for delicious, fresh fast food.  The salads are always made with mixed greens and their homemade dressing is the best.

I came on Monday during happy hour and reading a recent topic on the talk threads had me craving calamari.  They have it here and it is pretty good.  It&apos;s not as good as 8407 Kitchen Bar&apos;s, but it is two bucks cheaper ($7).  It was happy hour as I mentioned, so select appetizers and glasses of wine (large selection) are 25% off.  That means my calamari was only $5.25 and my Shiraz was $4.89.  For just ten bucks, it was very satisfying!

At these prices, I&apos;ll be back for happy hour again.

When we went they offered a Monday special of 40% off wine which was AWESOME! (They may still have this but I&apos;m not sure). Obviously (hint the name) they&apos;ve got a nice wine collection, and it&apos;s always fun to try new wines when it&apos;s discounted. We really enjoyed the casual relaxing environment and would recommend it as a pleasant place to eat if you happen to be in the downtown Silver Spring area.

This restaurant makes me glad I live so close to downtown Silver Spring! Excellent food (definitely try their eggplant fries!), a really nice selection of wine and friendly staff has made me a regular. As the other Yelpers mentioned, they have specials daily (even on weekends).

We came in Saturday evening and they were offering a special of 2 entrees (some seafood dishes excluded), an app and a select bottle of vino for $40. Definitely a sweet deal if you order a higher priced entree (mine was $15 and my wife&apos;s entree was $13). The bottle we chose, a Temparillo - wasn&apos;t great though. We should&apos;ve inquired for their suggestion instead of just picking one out.

Great seating area made us feel right at home, away from home. Recommended!

This could very well be the greatest place on earth (or at least in Silver Spring) for wine and a sandwich. I will admit they are semi-expensive during the week, however if you go for 40% off wine night on Monday nights you can get an entree and a bottle of wine for under 20 dollars!! You really can&apos;t beat that.

The staff is extremely nice and helpful- I came here for my birthday last year and they reserved tables for me even though that isn&apos;t a policy of theirs. They are also extremely knowledgeable with the wine so don&apos;t hesitate to ask them for suggestions!!

This place is definitely a hidden treasure, I&apos;m there every couple weeks or so and hope to see you as well!

Food is awesome! I used to work there so i know whats good. Every now and again I&apos;ll catch myself daydreaming of some of their tasty eats. =)

First of all, the Turkey Reuben always kicks butt. All time favorite there. I don&apos;t usually like reuben sandwiches, but the pear-cranberry chutney in this sandwich makes it so good!

I&apos;ve always loved the Capellini Fresca. Fresh bruschetta tomatoes, basil, garlic, chunks of mozzarella? Whats not to love? I like to add chicken to mine for a little protein.

Ceasar Wraps are awesome! I dunno why, but it&apos;s just good. With chicken or steak. Either way. Yum.

Jerk Wrap and Sandwich. The jerk seasoned chickenwith the mango combined with the lime mango vinaigrette..... awesome. I could eat these a lot without getting tired of them. The sandwich definitely changes it up as well because of the baguette.

Eggplant fries and Sweet Potato fries! Both are great. Some will prefer one or the other. You can get a half/half basket of each anyways. Love em both but I like the eggplant fries just a little bit more.

Grilled Tofu Salad! So delicious! The flavor of the grilled tofu is just awesome. I&apos;ve custom ordered this into a wrap as well in the &quot;red&quot; tortilla. I forgot which one that was...maybe sun dried tomato?... soo delicious that way, but if you don&apos;t finish it, the tortilla will get soggy, but then it can pretty much be turned back into a salad.

Ok hope this is a helpful kick start to try something great at Adega =)

My fiance and I went here for dinner last Saturday night.  We went for the special which gave us 1 app, 2 entrees, and a selected bottle of wine for $40.  We could choose anything from the menu that did not have a market price, and there were 4 bottles of wine (2 white, 2 red) to choose from.  We didn&apos;t have to wait long, and the service at this place was GREAT.  Even though you order at the counter and have to go up to grab your food, they bring your wine to your table where they uncork it, allow you to taste it, pour it, etc.  The gentleman even returned to refill our glasses periodically.

The food was okay, but not great.  We ordered the calamari appetizer, which was fine, but nothing special, and because it was served on a piece of wax paper, it seemed incredibly greasy... they might choose to serve this on a more absorbent material in the future so it doesn&apos;t look as icky.  I ordered the special gouda burger, and my fiance ordered the bleu cheese burger.  Both were cooked perfectly, but neither was amazing.  The gouda burger didn&apos;t have enough cheese and had too much BBQ sauce for my taste.  Plus, even though I knew I was getting kettle chips with the burger, I was disappointed not to have fries.

Overall, cute place and a good value, but not spectacular.

My husb and I love this place - an upscale but comfy cafe featuring a great wine selection. We hit it during the day, sometimes sitting outside (though you can&apos;t drink wine outside, wah), as well as at night after a movie at AFI or something. We just introduced it to a friend, and she took her mom a few days later!

Tried a few things on the menu - some homeruns, some disappointments. It&apos;s all about ordering the right things, which is why we haven&apos;t experimented too much. The Duke Ellington Sandwich is my favorite (roast beef, hefty slice of brie, caramelized onions, other deliciousness, all on fresh baguette). My biggest let-down was a flatbread sandwich, which was kind of soggy and totally fell apart as soon as I tried to eat it. We also always get the lobster bisque - which always says &quot;when available,&quot; but has yet to ever be unavailable when we go in. It&apos;s been over-salted on 2 occasions, but when it&apos;s right, it&apos;s so dang good it&apos;s worth rolling the dice.

One thing to note is that you don&apos;t have to be a wine connoisseur to feel at home here. There are plenty of those in attendance, speaking knowledgeably to and asking intelligent questions of the staff; however, I was given the same attention and treated with the same respect when I told them I was looking for a sweet wine with high alcohol content.

Fitting for dates or groups, this is a great place to keep in your rotation.

Had lunch here on Friday and really enjoyed it.  First of all, the ambiance of eating in the wine shop is v nice, next the Cuban sandwich was excellent. Tasty, juicy.... Yum mm!
They have a diverse menu and aren&apos;t that expensive.
I also hear you can buy a bottle of wine and they will open it for you and u can drink it there.

My fridge was empty when I returned. So my first meal out was at Adega with Mara G.

I had the &quot;Lobster Bisque&quot; and the jambalaya cappellini. Both were on par with a casual dining restaurant. Mara G. had the turkey reuben. Now that thing was out of this world. It had foccacia, sauerkraut, cranberries, and the russian dressing was so good. It was a delicious sandwich. I wish I had gotten that.

The &quot;service&quot;/&quot;set-up&quot; was a bit confusing. No one ever told us that we had to get our own water, utensils, napkins or condiments. We just went to our table. I&apos;m smart though. I figured it out.

The order taker seemed to rush me. Like I didn&apos;t know if I was supposed to pick my wine first then get some food or what. But I didn&apos;t have time to think about it because the order taker was all like hey can I help you which is a good thing but dam can I get a moment to think/peruse/browse? And I wish I&apos;d just done what I wanted to do because the wine I chose with my food was in the end not to my liking. Oh well.

I&apos;d come here again especially now that I know the deal. This place is a-ok with me.
