The Fat-Gram Guide to Restaurant Food

by Joseph C Piscatella 
 
 About this title: Joe Piscatella has listed the fat-gram and calorie content of 3,500 sit-down and fast-food restaurant foods. The book is organized by category-appetizers, breakfast foods, seafood, pasta, etc.-for the sit-down restaurants and by chain for the fast-food joints. Joe also offers eating strategies for dining out fat-smart. Since he is on the road and eating out over 100 days per year as a public speaker and promoter of his books, he has strategies that work.
