 Cronbach : Validity is not&quot;the degree to
which a test measures what it purports to measure.&quot;Validity is a property
of the inferences based on test scores. Validity refers to the quality of
decisions or judgments we make given test scores. For example, tests are used
to decide who to hire for a job. The validity of a test for that decision is
how useful the test is in hiring. A test may be used to decide whether a person
is schizophrenic, obsessive-compulsive, or alcoholic. The validity of the test
is evaluated in terms of how well it classifies clients into their respective
categories.

 Hull (a very famous psychologist
at the beginning of this century) noted in 1928 that psychological tests rarely
predicted job performance with a correlation greater than .30. He took this to
mean that tests could never be of much use in selecting people because they did
not predict job performance well.

Taylor and Russell (1939) answered Hull in what is one of the most famous papers in industrial and organizational
psychology. Their answer was that sometimes tests could be very useful in
selecting people even though the correlation between test scores and job
performance was not very high. They also noted that sometimes tests are not
very useful even when the correlation between test scores and job performance
is very high.

According to Taylor and Russell, there are three important factors to
consider when judging the usefulness (i.e., validity by Cronbach&apos;s definition). They are (a) the correlation between the test score and job
performance, (b) the base rate of success on the job, and (c) the selection
ratio.

But first, let&apos;s consider Taylor and Russell&apos; s quadrants:
