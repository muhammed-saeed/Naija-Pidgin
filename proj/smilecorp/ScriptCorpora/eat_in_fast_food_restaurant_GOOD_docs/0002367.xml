He came out of the west, a tabloid-trained conservative sharpshooter. Last year he was handed the reins of the Montreal Gazette . But it&apos;s been a rough ride—in the unfriendly territory of Quebec, Peter Stockland is a wanted man

 They&apos;ve got a fire burning outside.
 Our tongues taste the smoke that seeps in through different wall
 cracks every time the wind shifts... They&apos;re going to hang us. 



The year is 1879. In a ramshackle
 cabin somewhere near Kamloops, Alex Hare endures a siege. He&apos;s
 haunted by fragmented memories of a murderous rampage. Maybe
 those crimes are why he&apos;s on the shack&apos;s floor with a few other
 fugitives, cold, thirsty, wounded, surrounded by enemies among
 the snowy pines. Or maybe it&apos;s because he and the other young
 M?tis have darker skin than the white ranchers outside. Maybe the
 shots, the smoke, the standoff that support the whole structure
 of this piece of short fiction, are symbolic of tensions between
 races, between tribes of men who have fought for generations and
 will fight again.

Whatever the reason, Hare and his
 friends are in trouble. Their tongues swell from thirst.
 Vigilantes surround them, taking occasional potshots. Hare&apos;s leg
 bone is shattered after one of his friends-the one who drew him
 into the gang in the first place-goes crazy and shoots him while
 he sleeps. As a reader, you want to hate the character of Alex
 Hare; he has slit a white rancher&apos;s throat and licked blood from
 the blade. But the way he explains it, it wasn&apos;t his fault. You
 almost find yourself feeling sorry for him.

The year is
 2001 now, on the other side of the continent. On the surface, the
 young outlaw Alex Hare hasn&apos;t much in common with Peter
 Stockland, the 45-year-old author, editor, columnist and former
 reporter whose short story about Hare, &quot;Brothers,&quot; appeared in 89
 Best Canadian Stories. But the two men&apos;s circumstances are
 remarkably similar. Stockland, also from Kamloops, is holed up on
 the fifth floor of The Gazette&apos;s grey office tower in downtown
 Montreal. He&apos;s putting on a brave face knowing his enemies wait
 outside. He hears their potshots ricochet off his reputation.
 They won&apos;t forget what he&apos;s done or written. A bedrock social
 conservative, he sticks out like a M?tis among white ranchers
 here in Montreal, one of North America&apos;s most liberal cities.
 With circulation drying up, he&apos;s thirsty for readers. He says
 it&apos;s nothing, just a scratch, but he&apos;s limping from where his
 ally-the one who put him in the editor-in-chief&apos;s office at The
 Gazette-crippled him by selling the newspaper. You can&apos;t help
 feeling a bit sorry for him.

Of course, not everybody
 feels sorry for Peter Stockland. Some complain he got his new job
 because his libertarian, right-of-centre views were close to
 those of his former boss, newspaper baron Conrad Black. Then,
 last summer, Black sold most of his Canadian papers-including The
 Gazette-to CanWest Global Communications, leaving Stockland at
 the mercy of a more liberal parent company. His fiercest critics
 hold little sympathy for a man they describe as a &quot;right-wing
 asshole,&quot; a &quot;hard-edged ideologue,&quot; a &quot;propagandist.&quot; He faces an
 especially tough reception in Quebec, where he endures the
 reputation of being a writer from the West who once called
 francophone culture &quot;a hoax,&quot; resulting in threats that pressured
 his family to move briefly.

Even his personality seems
 at odds with Montreal. A nonsmoker, Stockland could walk into a
 Harvey&apos;s burger shop in this city and barely read the back-lit
 menu board through the haze of cigarette smoke. Or, touring his
 new press plant in the west end, the former columnist, who
 spouted moral indignation about all varieties of human foibles,
 might look across the street and notice the Cabaret les Amazones,
 a strip club that looks like a fast food restaurant-appropriate,
 since strip shows seem as casually available as hamburgers here.
 Or, as happened recently, the pink-faced, wide-awake
 editor-in-chief could stride into a morning meeting with other
 senior editors who sit bleary-eyed around a table cradling
 upscale coffees. At first, Stockland&apos;s demeanor suits the
 newspaper&apos;s reputation as a sober, middle-class broadsheet
 catering to the city&apos;s upscale Anglo minority: he discusses the
 day&apos;s stories thoughtfully, asking intelligent questions in his
 soft, deferential voice. Then he gently reprimands the city
 editor over a murder story that could have been played
 bigger-causing a brief pause in the conversation as the other
 editors remember, yes, their new boss spent most of his career at
 tabloids. Later, somebody mentions a quirky item in a competing
 paper about a moviegoer who was so disgusted by a film that he
 stole it from the projectionist&apos;s booth and unfurled the
 celluloid in the street. They decide to follow the story with a
 piece about this and other violent reactions to performances.
 Leaning forward, his face flushing, Stockland relaxes his quiet,
 thoughtful persona to reveal a boyish enthusiasm. He tells an
 anecdote about a comedian who angered an audience member so much
 that the man climbed on stage and punched the performer in the
 face. &quot;He just gave it to him!&quot; Stockland chortles, smacking his
 fist into his palm for emphasis, his thick forearm bulging
 beneath a rolled-up sleeve. None of the other editors laughs.
 Their sleeves are neatly ironed and buttoned. Someone takes a sip
 of coffee. This westerner doesn&apos;t quite fit in. The unspoken
 question among them is, Where did this guy come from?



Stockland was raised in a working-class neighbourhood
 in Kamloops, British Columbia. His father, Eyolf, who died when
 Stockland was 13, worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway.
 Stockland&apos;s cousin, uncle, grandfather and most of their
 neighbours worked on the railroad. The town&apos;s dominant industries
 were rail yards, cattle ranches and pulp mills. Stockland retains
 some folksiness from his blue-collar roots: &quot;That was fair ball,&quot;
 he&apos;ll say, and he&apos;ll refer to men in his anecdotes as &quot;this guy,&quot;
 as in, &quot;So this guy climbs up on stage and takes a swing at this
 comedian guy.&quot; Although Stockland has never belonged to any
 political party and didn&apos;t vote in the last federal election, his
 famously conservative views have their roots in this western
 working town and his solid Anglican upbringing. He still goes to
 church most Sundays, though he has since converted to his wife&apos;s
 Catholicism.

But while Kamloops shaped him, he was also
 much too ambitious to stay. When he appeared on a kids&apos;
 television show in Grade 3, the host asked him what he wanted to
 do when he grew up. Stockland said he wanted to be a writer and a
 reader, and everyone laughed. But it was true. He started his
 hobby of writing short stories in elementary school. Reading The
 Vancouver Sun often made him late for his paper route. He once
 failed an English assignment because he imitated his favourite
 sportswriter&apos;s style. He learned how to get a reaction with
 controversial words at age 10, when he and a friend put a sign on
 the local Elks&apos; hall urging passersby to &quot;Join Hitler&apos;s Youth,&quot;
 with a phone number for the RCMP written underneath. His father,
 who had gone hungry during the Nazi occupation of Norway, scolded
 him severely.

Rather than take up his father&apos;s trade
 after high school, he enrolled in the University of British
 Columbia&apos;s English program, working part-time for a suburban
 weekly, scraping stories out of soporific council meetings. He
 spent one semester at a daily paper in Medicine Hat before
 graduating in 1979 and scoring a job covering city hall at the
 Vernon Daily News. Two years later he moved back to his hometown
 and joined the Kamloops Sentinel. There he shared a basement
 apartment with one of the Sentinel&apos;s half-dozen reporters, Steven
 Edwards, who became a lasting friend. They had to roll
 Stockland&apos;s blue Volkswagen van downhill each morning to get the
 engine going.

The 25-year-old Stockland was already so
 enthralled by the newspaper business, Edwards says, that he once
 attended a Halloween party wearing enlarged pages of the
 Sentinel. The ambitious roommates felt they were headed for great
 things in the news business. (An accurate premonition: Edwards is
 now Southam&apos;s United Nations correspondent in New York.)
 Stockland, never staying at one job for very long, remembers
 working harder during this period than ever since, scrambling to
 cover general assignments at understaffed dailies. He was also
 learning French part-time. After all, he wasn&apos;t going to stay in
 B.C. forever.

Before leaving his home province, though,
 he met his future wife, Linda Couture. A Quebecer transplanted to
 Kamloops by a federal program promoting French, Couture arranged
 lunch with Stockland hoping he&apos;d write an article about her work.
 She fell in love with the soft-spoken reporter who was learning
 her mother tongue and they married in the summer of 1982. (Today,
 they have two children, Marie-Desneiges, 15, and ?tienne, 13.)
 They had already moved that spring to Edmonton, where Stockland
 went to work for Sun Media. He would stay with the punchy tabloid
 chain for the next 14 years.

Though Stockland speaks
 quietly, almost demurely, often pausing for thought before
 opening his mouth, there&apos;s another side to his character. His
 brashness, the same puckish penchant for stirring up trouble that
 inspired his &quot;Hitler Youth&quot; sign, helped him thrive at the Sun
 papers. It also provoked him to try some memorable pranks, like
 the time in 1985 when he got together with a few fellow reporters
 at The Edmonton Sun and staged a tongue-in-cheek picket in front
 of CBC Edmonton studios to protest the cancellation of Robert
 Homme&apos;s television show for children, The Friendly Giant, waving
 placards with slogans like &quot;Don&apos;t Let Rusty Get Dusty&quot; and &quot;CBC
 Committing Homme-cide.&quot;

That brashness, bordering on
 pugnaciousness, could explain an embarrassing incident after his
 move to Sun Media&apos;s new Ottawa bureau in 1986, where he served as
 a reporter and columnist. When a television cameraman jostled him
 during a scrum in Parliament, Stockland waited until the scrum
 was breaking up, turned to the cameraman and told him to keep his
 hands off. The guy pushed him again and walked away across the
 foyer of the Commons. Stockland followed him and remembers
 saying, &quot;Put your fucking hands on me again and I&apos;ll drop you
 right where you&apos;re standing.&quot; According to Stockland, the other
 journalist turned and raised his hands, so Stockland punched him.

Stockland couldn&apos;t stay out of trouble even after he
 moved to Quebec City as a Sun Media correspondent two years
 later, where he wrote columns and covered news in the province.
 In the politically charged atmosphere around Meech Lake, his
 patriotic westerner&apos;s views were often interpreted as
 anti-French. A column on November 30, 1989, drew particular
 criticism: &quot;Quebec&apos;s Culture? Please, I feel an attack of the .44
 Magnums coming on. Because the harsh truth is the celebrated
 Culture of this province is largely a hoax.&quot; A French CBC radio
 host denounced Stockland&apos;s column and broadcast his address and
 home phone number. Stockland had just returned home after a week
 in Montreal covering the massacre of 14 female students by an
 armed lunatic, so the destructive potential of lone extremists
 preyed on his mind when his family began receiving threatening
 calls. He sent his wife and children to stay with some local
 in-laws for a few days. Stockland says he was only trying,
 clumsily, to say Quebec has adopted aspects of American culture.
 He says the severity of the backlash against that column was
 exaggerated by the overheated atmosphere of Meech Lake. But
 Robert Fife, Ottawa bureau chief at the time, says he&apos;s never had
 another writer&apos;s family forced to leave home because of death
 threats.

Although today Stockland says the family&apos;s
 return to Ottawa the next summer was unrelated, he couldn&apos;t have
 been entirely unhappy when Sun Media folded its Quebec bureau and
 he was transferred back to his old job in the nation&apos;s capital.
 Stockland moved again in 1994, after being appointed editor of
 The Calgary Sun, where he continued to write a column. But that
 single &quot;hoax&quot; column keeps cropping up in certain political and
 media circles in Montreal when Stockland&apos;s name comes up. It&apos;s
 burned into memory like a notorious crime. The other troubling
 episode in the new editor&apos;s history, these Montrealers say, was
 his part in a regime that cranked the Calgary Herald&apos;s outlook
 hard to the political right-in the words of Herald columnist
 Catherine Ford, &quot;shoving our metaphorical nose so far up the
 Reform Party&apos;s ass we can&apos;t see daylight.&quot; The Herald&apos;s
 editor-in-chief at the time, Crosbie Cotton, hired Stockland in
 1996 from the Sun. When Stockland arrived, Cotton was already
 trying to correct what he saw as the paper&apos;s drift leftwards away
 from Calgary attitudes. A common joke before his reforms, Cotton
 says, was that if Conservative Premier Ralph Klein figured a way
 to spin lead into gold, the Herald headline would have been &quot;Lead
 Shortage Looms.&quot;

Cotton gave Stockland a column, widely
 syndicated through the Southam chain, which he continued to write
 after becoming editorial page editor in 1999. During these years
 in Calgary, as he abandoned reporting and focused on opinion
 writing, Stockland earned a reputation as one of Canada&apos;s most
 conservative voices. He attacked a Pulitzer Prize-winning play
 featuring gay men, defended parents&apos; right to spank their
 children, scorned the UN&apos;s &quot;social engineers,&quot; denounced abortion
 and complained about a decision allowing women to bare their
 breasts in public. He mused that militant right-wing critic Ted
 Byfield wasn&apos;t critical enough, ridiculed &quot;bourgeois&quot; workers
 like teachers and journalists who wanted to fight for unions and
 called human-rights commissions, equity boards and harassment
 panels &quot;self-sustaining guilt industries.&quot; Liberalism, he wrote,
 is &quot;debauched&quot; and &quot;poisonous.&quot; It&apos;s not as if Stockland slit a
 man&apos;s throat and licked the blade, but his attacks on liberal
 ideas certainly drew fire. Peter Gzowski called him a &quot;right-wing
 asshole from Alberta.&quot; Andy Marshall, a Herald reporter at the
 time who later led the local union, says many people muttered
 about the paper&apos;s tone after Stockland&apos;s arrival. &quot;I thought a
 kind of nastiness entered the way things were debated.&quot;

The paper&apos;s new outlook was among the many complaints that fueled
 discontent at the Herald in 1999. More than 100 newsroom workers
 walked out that November, leaving senior editors like Stockland
 with only 28 staff. Stockland had long opposed the formation of a
 union. Even before becoming an editor, he lobbied his colleagues
 with leaflets and vocal appeals, arguing that the journalists
 should give management six months to fix what wasn&apos;t working. &quot;He
 took upon himself the role of company propagandist,&quot; Marshall
 says.

One day in late December, Stockland was crossing
 the picket line, driving a minivan out of the Herald&apos;s parking
 lot. Radio reporter Carol Adams, covering the strike for
 Calgary&apos;s CKUA, says she saw him gesture at the crowd with the
 idiomatic finger. Word got around about the insult and Stockland
 called her, told her she was delusional, swore at her and hung
 up. (Adams now emphasizes the gesture was out of character for a
 man she considers a &quot;gentleman.&quot;)

When asked about the
 incident, Stockland admits he made the call, but says he was
 angry at Adams only because he hadn&apos;t made the obscene gesture.
 In an explanation that&apos;s similar to his account of the earlier
 skirmish with Quebec nationalists during Meech, he claims to have
 been misunderstood in an emotionally charged situation. The
 anecdote was widely repeated, he says, but misrepresented how he
 felt about the strikers. &quot;I gave a damn about what was happening
 to those people,&quot; he says, his face turning red. Sounding weary,
 he repeats his family&apos;s working-class origins and ties with the
 railroad union: &quot;I&apos;m not anti-union.&quot;

Anti-union or
 not, Stockland&apos;s performance at the Herald must have appealed to
 his bosses at Southam, whose management had become more
 politically conservative since Conrad Black&apos;s Hollinger bought
 control of the newspaper chain in 1996. Last spring, Stockland
 got a phone call from Gordon Fisher, Southam&apos;s vice-president,
 editorial, in Toronto, asking whether he&apos;d be interested in an
 unnamed, soon-to-be-vacant editor-in-chief&apos;s position. Stockland
 said yes. It&apos;s widely believed that he was Black&apos;s pick because
 he had a right-wing westerner&apos;s outlook but experience working in
 Quebec and fluency in French, unusual qualifications that
 probably limited the number of candidates. Once again, Stockland
 moved east.



 There&apos;s not going to be
 any chance for us to ride out of here.... 



In the story of Alex Hare, he&apos;s trapped in winter
 woods, surrounded by a posse of ranchers. He smells their cooking
 fires, hears more wagons arriving as they lay siege to his cabin.
 He&apos;s vastly outnumbered. On July 25, 2000, a Globe and Mail story
 predicted an equally unpleasant greeting awaited Peter Stockland
 in Montreal: &quot;The appointment announced yesterday may raise
 hackles among some francophone media or nationalist circles.&quot;
 Indeed, Quebec&apos;s media reacted to Stockland by circling the
 wagons. Le Soleil, Quebec City&apos;s daily, carried an item the same
 day referring to his &quot;hoax&quot; comment, and an article appeared the
 next day in Le Devoir, the upscale Montreal daily, focusing on
 the same thing. A longer story appeared the following day in La
 Presse, the larger-circulation Montreal daily, also leading with
 the &quot;hoax&quot; quote and including descriptions of Stockland&apos;s most
 extreme right-wing Herald columns. For reactions, the press
 turned to people like Matthew Hays, associate editor of the
 weekly Montreal Mirror, who says Stockland&apos;s columns at the
 Herald showed a hostility toward gay rights (despite one of
 Stockland&apos;s columns mentioning his gay friend who died of AIDS).
 For Southam to appoint an editor so unsuited to Montreal, Hays
 says, the company either lacks a sense of the local market or was
 sabotaging The Gazette to help Black&apos;s new national daily, the
 National Post.

But media weren&apos;t the only ones taking
 shots. Many nationalists were surprised by the appointment, says
 Robin Philpot, head of communications for a separatist group, the
 Soci?t? Saint-Jean-Baptiste. His fax machine was busy that week
 as people sent him Stockland&apos;s clippings. But the clips weren&apos;t
 necessary: like many politically minded Quebecers, Philpot
 remembers perfectly what the &quot;hard-edged ideologue&quot; wrote during
 Meech. Language and cultural issues may have faded from public
 discussion in the rest of Canada, but Quebec is still a place
 where an English sign is enough to provoke the firebombing of a
 coffee shop. Nationalists like Philpot can&apos;t abide a man who
 questioned Quebec&apos;s distinctiveness. &quot;One would hope Izzy Asper
 would push him out,&quot; he says.

Philpot is referring to
 an announcement on July 31-less than a week after Stockland&apos;s
 appointment was confirmed-that The Gazette would be sold to Izzy
 Asper&apos;s CanWest Global Communications along with other Southam
 papers. Stockland was visiting Montreal that day and says he
 didn&apos;t hear news of the takeover until Gazette managing editor
 Raymond Brassard called him, asking, &quot;How do you like Izzy
 Asper?&quot; Stockland shrugs while telling the story, remembering his
 bafflement. &quot;I said, &apos;Well, I met him at an editorial board
 once.&apos;&quot;

Several months later, Stockland still says the
 new ownership doesn&apos;t mean much to him. But many believe Black&apos;s
 surprise announcement hit him like a bullet in the night,
 crippling any plans he might have had to change the paper. A
 Gazette writer described the week as a &quot;roller coaster&quot;-whereas
 some staffers had worried the paper would get more conservative,
 the writer said, the new ownership could mean a drift in the
 opposite direction. It&apos;s not impossible to imagine Conrad Black
 appointing Stockland to affect The Gazette&apos;s ideology, but The
 Gazette&apos;s subsequent sale to more liberal owners left Stockland
 without that mandate-especially in a predominately liberal city,
 with a liberal publisher and a liberal newsroom.

When
 Stockland arrived in Montreal, he soon discovered that French
 media and nationalists weren&apos;t the only ones waiting for him
 among the snowy pines. The newsroom was also skeptical about him.
 &quot;There was some pretty understandable trepidation that this guy
 was going to come in from the west and work from the top down,&quot;
 Stockland says. One of the most vocal Gazette staffers was
 reporter Alexander Norris, who makes no secret of his antipathy
 toward Conrad Black. Norris has pictures of the rotund newspaper
 owner tacked outside his cubicle. He even obliquely criticized
 Southam&apos;s management in his acceptance speech after winning a
 National Newspaper Award last year. He&apos;s so famously outspoken
 that half a dozen Gazette insiders offer his name when asked
 about newsroom reaction to Stockland: I won&apos;t speak for the
 record, they say, but maybe Alex will talk to you.

When
 Norris does talk, his only request is that the article mustn&apos;t
 suggest he&apos;s speaking only for himself. Then he describes
 Stockland&apos;s appointment with precisely the same phrase others
 used: &quot;It&apos;s a strange fit,&quot; he says. &quot;This is one of the most
 liberal cities in North America, and Conrad Black has given us
 someone from the far-right fringes of Alberta public opinion.&quot;

Norris views Stockland as another part of The Gazette&apos;s
 shift to the right under Black&apos;s ownership, which began, he says,
 when former editor-in-chief Joan Fraser was forced out and
 replaced with the more conservative Alan Allnut, then continued
 when right-wingers Peter Hadekel and Brian Kappler were named
 editorial page editor and city editor respectively. He believes
 appointing Stockland was Black&apos;s last attempt to influence The
 Gazette before it was sold to CanWest. &quot;Appointing someone like
 Stockland is like stacking the Senate when you&apos;re defeated,&quot; he
 says. The barrage of bad press about the appointment wasn&apos;t good
 for The Gazette, he continues, though Stockland was an easy
 target. &quot;There seems to be such a record of intemperate,
 ill-thought-out, intolerant, offensive things he&apos;s written.&quot;

But Stockland faces other challenges, too. The Gazette
 is thirsty for readers. NADbank figures for adult weekday
 readership dropped more than 16 per cent in the last five years,
 with lighter losses on Saturdays but an even steeper slide on
 Sundays. The Gazette&apos;s old unilingual readership dwindles every
 year in Montreal, replaced by a new category of reader: the
 allophone, typically a multilingual child of immigrant parents
 who doesn&apos;t identify with either side of the language wars. But
 Montreal&apos;s increasing bilingualism and multilingualism undermine
 the paper&apos;s traditional monopoly on English-only readers, since
 more English speakers feel comfortable reading French. In the
 daily fight for news, The Gazette faces an uphill battle: its
 medium-sized readership means it can afford only a medium-sized
 staff to cover a big city. Another difficulty for Stockland, who
 always saw himself as a writer, is the budgeting and paperwork
 for his 180 employees. When asked about budgeting, he chuckles,
 shakes his head and says, &quot;I have the unique ability to take my
 own head off and stuff it up my ass.&quot; In a more serious moment,
 he reflects that the logistics of running a newspaper are more
 complicated than he&apos;d imagined. Under the circumstances, it&apos;s not
 surprising that rumours circulate, suggesting the new
 editor-in-chief might not last long.



 Our tongues are swelling and turning black from
 thirst... We clawed open a chink in a wall, scraped snow onto our
 fingers, pulled our hands back inside before their bullets
 hit. 



In Stockland&apos;s story, it
 doesn&apos;t look as if Alex Hare will last much longer. He can&apos;t
 walk. His friends have run low on ammunition. He takes a lump of
 charcoal, scribbles a plea for leniency on a scrap of paper and
 sends it to the ranchers outside. But it&apos;s unlikely his message
 will persuade anyone. Hare is pathetic, but he doesn&apos;t inspire
 sympathy. In a Globe review of the book, where Stockland&apos;s story
 was rated the worst in a collection that included stories by
 gifted writers like Alice Munro and Steven Heighton, the reviewer
 concluded: &quot;We never really become involved enough to care.&quot;

In this story of Stockland, the opposite is true.
 Several weeks after the volley of critical articles by Quebec
 reporters-who only spoke to Stockland by phone-a writer named
 Marie-Andr?e Amiot interviewed him at The Gazette for a French
 media journal, Le 30. Entering his spacious office, she might
 have noticed his bookshelf stocked with just the kind of
 conservative tracts she expected to see, by the likes of George
 W. Bush, Neil Bissoondath, Ted Byfield and William D. Gairdner.
 But then, surprisingly, tucked in beside Ezra Levant&apos;s
 Youthquake, there&apos;s the screenplay for Atom Egoyan&apos;s dark,
 obsessive, sensual film Exotica-suggesting subtler tones in
 Stockland&apos;s personality. And there&apos;s the man himself, smiling,
 taking a visitor&apos;s coat and gesturing disarmingly at a chair. His
 choirboy face and gentle, fluent French are at odds with the
 image of a man who inspired what Amiot calls &quot;horror and
 distress&quot; in the Gazette newsroom. She wrote, &quot;One cannot help
 but ask oneself, Where is the monster?&quot;

It&apos;s a question
 on many staffers&apos; lips. Like Amiot, they&apos;re noticing aspects of
 him that weren&apos;t included in press reports. They see him walking
 around the newsroom and talking with reporters, a habit that
 would have been out of character for his more bureaucratic
 predecessor. He seems open to new ideas, they admit, and he makes
 bold editorial decisions. Before his arrival, The Gazette might
 not have given its whole front page to the text of Justin
 Trudeau&apos;s eulogy for his father-including the French passages, no
 less. And the photos of Karla Homolka enjoying herself in
 prison-a scoop that resulted in Homolka&apos;s transfer to a stricter
 facility-might not have hit the front page with quite the same
 impact, boosting single-copy sales and attracting national
 attention. Indeed, the Homolka item ran with a heavy, black
 headline that read &quot;Karla&apos;s Prison Party,&quot; but tabloid veteran
 Stockland had wanted something even stronger: &quot;Cakes in Jail,&quot; or
 &quot;Killer in a Cocktail Dress.&quot; Reporter Bill Marsden says the
 paper is long overdue for someone that gutsy in the
 editor-in-chief&apos;s office. &quot;A lot of people here are screaming
 about the fact that he&apos;s a right-wing fanatic, or some religious
 freak or God knows what, some Catholic nut-case. But I don&apos;t
 care. What I care about is, is he a good journalist?&quot;

But journalism wasn&apos;t the only factor in Stockland&apos;s boldest
 decision so far. In a deft managerial move, he posted a memo in
 November announcing city editor Brian Kappler would leave the
 department to become a political editor in the new year.
 Stockland says his only reason for relocating Kappler was because
 he&apos;d be well-suited to a column on national issues. In an email,
 a Gazette writer warned that giving space to Kappler&apos;s &quot;Fraser
 Institute/libertarian/Newt Gingrich views&quot; could make the paper
 more conservative.

But to judge by the effect of the
 memo on Stockland&apos;s staff, he could have scribbled it with a lump
 of charcoal on scrap paper. Many reporters disliked Kappler, and
 Stockland had heard their feelings in meetings he&apos;d held with
 newsroom staff during the summer. Whether or not it was his
 intention, ousting Kappler made Stockland more popular. A group
 of staffers held an impromptu celebration the next night at a pub
 on Avenue Duluth in the Plateau Mont-Royal entertainment
 district. The party was well attended, recalls Alex Norris. &quot;It&apos;s
 the happiest I&apos;ve seen The Gazette staff in years.&quot; Although he
 remains skeptical, even Norris says this decision changed his
 view of Stockland. Enunciating each word to make sure he&apos;s
 correctly quoted, he says, &quot;I can only praise this bold move.&quot; In
 fact, Norris says he wouldn&apos;t have spoken about his misgivings at
 all if he&apos;d been asked for an interview after the announcement
 about Kappler.

Stockland says he&apos;s pleasantly surprised
 he&apos;s won over many of his staff. He has been saying since he
 arrived that he isn&apos;t interested in imposing a political agenda,
 that he hopes to transcend divisive squabbles. He likes to talk
 about ways of escaping the journalistic &quot;conflict model.&quot; One of
 his favourite projects at the Herald, he says, was a series of
 profiles of regular people. He once wrote a short review of a
 Chinese restaurant and didn&apos;t think much about it until he
 returned to find the article taped to the restaurant&apos;s door and
 people reading it, laughing. This is good journalism, he says. We
 don&apos;t have to write about fights. In other words, it doesn&apos;t have
 to be about tribes of men who fought for generations and will
 fight again. The middle-aged Peter Stockland seems to have
 outgrown his old persona as a feisty cameraman-puncher, spoiling
 for a fight. What separates him from his bloodthirsty fugitive is
 his supernatural ability to limp out of that cabin into the snowy
 woods, throw his rifle aside and talk to those who surround him.
 It looks impossible; surely they&apos;ll shoot him. But instead, he
 seems to win their respect.

Sometime after the snow
 melts in spring, after this magazine hits newsstands, a
 redesigned Gazette is expected to start rolling off the presses
 at a new, $63-million production facility on Rue St-Jacques in
 the city&apos;s west end. The plant isn&apos;t much to look at now, just
 brick and aluminum siding plunked down in an empty lot choked
 with weeds and young sumac trees. Not much is being said about
 the redesign, either, which has been in the works for a year. But
 executives at the paper promise it will be livelier and more
 compelling. Each issue will get more colour pages and more
 colourful content. Perhaps most importantly for a publication
 that is losing readers, it will get a fresh start.

In
 the end, that&apos;s what will decide the fate of Peter Stockland in
 Montreal. If he can make this new Gazette work, his staff may
 forget that he&apos;s a tabloid man at a broadsheet paper. They&apos;ll
 forget he&apos;s a right-wing columnist transplanted into the top job
 at a liberal newsroom. His &quot;hoax&quot; comment will fade into history.
 It&apos;s happening already, although he&apos;s not out of the woods yet.
