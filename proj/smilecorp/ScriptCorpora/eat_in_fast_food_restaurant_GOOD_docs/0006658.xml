Everytime I vist India I have to visit Swati atleast 4-5 times. The food is outstanding. Some of the dishes I enjoy are Thalipith with Gatta Nu Shak, Dhanshak (tradional Parsi dish), Fadda Ni Kicchdi (Tradional Gujarati Rice Dish), Panki (South Indian Dish) and Falafel. The portions are small so order atleast 2-3 dishes per person. I finish off with Sitafal Icecream or Malai Malupua for dessert. If you like snow cones or Baraf Gola&apos;s it is totally safe as they make it from bottled water.

The only downfall you have to wait about 30-40 minutes at any time of the day because it is an extremly poular restaurants. Forget going there on Sunday&apos;s cause you will wait a minimum of 60 minutes.

The food is totally wait the worth. I always wish I can take some back home.
