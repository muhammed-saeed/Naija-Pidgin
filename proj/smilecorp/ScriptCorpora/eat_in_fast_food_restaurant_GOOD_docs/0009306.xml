At the Lewis-Palmer District 38 School Board meeting Dec. 22,
the board unanimously accepted a letter of resignation from Dr. Michael Pomarico.
Due to inclement weather and prior commitments, board members Stephen Plank and
Gail Wilson were absent. President Jes Raintree said that due to the absences of
the two board members, many of the agenda items were postponed to the Jan. 18
meeting.
 
Pomarico to receive $244,262 in compensation and severance pay
 
Raintree said the superintendents resignation Dec. 15 was
due to&quot;extenuating personal circumstances.&quot;Pomarico started work
July 1.

A subsequent press release quoted Raintree as saying&quot;The Board of Education and Dr. Pomarico have reached a mutually agreeable
separation.&quot;The press release went on to say&quot;The Board and Dr.
Pomarico have agreed that he will accept paid administrative leave through June
30, 2007. (The remaining balance of the total 2006-07 superintendent
compensation package is $94,261.54.) Dr. Pomarico will receive a severance
payment of $150,000 on or before June 30, 2007. The Board of Education
unanimously agreed this action was in the best interest in pursuing excellence
for all our students. The superintendent position will not be filled for the
time being. The Board of Education is reviewing leadership team positions and
delineation of responsibilities for the coming months.&quot;

After concluding the 8-minute board meeting, the board went
into an executive session to discuss personnel matters. Raintree asked Assistant
Superintendent Ray Blanch and Chief Financial Officer Cheryl Wangeman to attend
that executive session.
 
$57 million in bonds sold
 
In a separate press release issued Dec. 13, the district
reported the sale of $57 million in general obligation bonds to fund the
construction of the second high school and improvements at Lewis-Palmer High
School. The reported true interest cost is 4.307 percent and the bonds have an
average life expectancy of 15.853 years. The average coupon is 5.54 percent.
Groundbreaking for the second high school is scheduled for April 2007.
Improvements to Lewis-Palmer High School are scheduled to begin in the first
quarter of 2007.

The Lewis-Palmer School District selected Assistant
Superintendent Ray Blanch as&quot;the finalist&quot;for filling the vacant
superintendent position during a special board meeting on Jan. 3. The board also
gave Blanch the powers of the office until the formal appointment, which is
scheduled to take place on Jan. 18 at the next regular meeting. The board also
unanimously approved the formation of an Educators Advisory Group consisting
of one elementary, middle school, and high school principal to lighten the
workload carried by the new superintendent.
 
Work session paves the way for Blanchs selection
 
The 11 a.m. meeting started off with a 40-minute executive
session by the board with Blanch. After returning to open session, the board and
numerous staff and committee members of the district discussed options for
appointing an interim or acting superintendent, as well as selecting a new
superintendent with or without a search. Numerous specific prioritized
leadership goals were also recorded. After this work session, Board President
Jes Raintree visited each school to discuss the results with the staffs.
 
New leadership structure announced at special board meeting
 
At the special board meeting at 5 p.m., the board unanimously
passed a motion declaring Assistant Superintendent Ray Blanch the finalist for
filling the currently vacant position of former superintendent Michael Pomarico
and that the final decision on the next superintendent will be made at the next
regular board meeting on Jan. 18. The board also gave Blanch, by acclimation,
the authority to exercise all the authority of the superintendent to carry out
the duties and responsibilities of the position in the interim.

Board Treasurer Gail Wilson said she had re-read the list of
qualities and special considerations in the brochure advertising for the
previous search and found that Blanch met or exceeded every one. Board Secretary
LouAnn Dekleva said the board had a good discussion&quot;on how not to burn out
a superintendent&quot;and how to provide support and better information
directly to the next appointee. Director Steve Plank thanked Blanch for&quot;taking on this and understanding where were going.&quot;
 
Composition of the committee to name the second high school set
 
Raintree reported that in accordance with district policy,
the board would appoint a committee to name the second high school, which will
be built on the Hunter Run Farm property. She pointed out that the mascot and
colors for the new school would be selected by the future members of the school
as a team-building process. She added the committee members will be appointed
soon so a name can be selected prior to breaking ground on Apr. 1. Committee
membership will include community members from Palmer Lake, Monument, Black
Forest, plus one retired person who has lived here for a long time and no longer
has children attending D-38 schools. Input on the name will also be sought from
students who will attend the new school.
 
Advisory group created
 
Plank formally suggested formation of an Educators
Advisory Group to advise and assist the new superintendent in performing the
duties of the position. He said they would be a resource for Blanch, because the
position now has&quot;way too many things for them to do and the things that
they do are pretty weighty,&quot;leading to turnover every two to three years
throughout Colorado. The board approved formation of the committee, then
appointed Principals Mark Brewer of Lewis-Palmer High School, Terry Miller of
Lewis-Palmer Middle School, and Alexis Miller-Gibbore of Grace Best Elementary
School to this group.

Raintree said she needed to note that this group would not
replace or affect the operations of the Superintendents Council or the
Administrative Council. She said the advisory group would&quot;represent the
voice of all the educators at that level for discussion and decisions&quot;so&quot;information is flowing all the way through.&quot;Plank added,&quot;As weve
been growing larger weve lost some of that. In the last few months we lost
quite a bit of that.&quot;

The meeting adjourned at 5:20 p.m.

After adjournment, Wilson reiterated to reporters that the
board was trying to restore the level of communications and access to the
superintendent that had been a strength of the district before it started to
grow so rapidly as well as understand the causes of the rapid turnover in this
office.

 
 
 Monument Board of Trustees, December 4: Monument
Board approves $7.3 million 2007 budget
 
By Jim Kendrick
 
On Dec. 4, the Monument Board of Trustees (BOT) approved the
mill levy certification, budget, and appropriation for 2007. The board also
approved an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the newly formed Pikes Peak
Rural Water Authority, and two plats for Monument Marketplace. Trustees Travis
Easton and Steve Samuels were absent.
 
Four votes required for 2007 budget approval
 
2007 mill levy certification resolution approved: The towns
2007 property tax mill levy will be 6.4568 mills, an increase of 0.586 mill from
2006. Treasurer Pamela Smith said the mill levy increase was needed because it
had been temporarily lowered for 2006, the certification had to be submitted to
the Board of County Commissioners by Dec. 15, and the town has millions of
dollars of capital projects to complete including the new Town Hall/Police
Station building, Skate Board Park, and the Stormwater Master Plan. The maximum
tax raised on the towns net assessed valuation of $75,753,550 is $489,279.
This rate meets the states 5.5 percent revenue limit and TABOR restrictions.
The board unanimously approved the certification.
 
New capital fund created
 
Smith said that during a preliminary 2006 budget review, the
towns auditor had suggested creating a new capital projects building fund to
better track construction expenditures for the new Town Hall/Police Station to
be built at Beacon Lite Road and Highway 105, segregating those transactions
from the general fund. Revenue for this new major fund will come from the 1
percent sales tax that had been restricted to capital water projects and
purchase of water and water rights. In 2005, town voters approved ballot
question 2A, which authorized use of some of the accumulated sales tax revenues
for building the new Town Hall/Police Station building in 2007.

After opening a public hearing during which there were no
citizen comments, the board unanimously approved an ordinance creating the new
major fund in the 2007 budget. This ordinance did not increase the size of the
budget but only shifted some of the existing line items to the new fund.
 
2007 budget ordinance approved
 
Smith noted that the draft 2007 budget was presented to the
board on Sept. 18. Each department head made a presentation on accomplishments,
short-term and long-term goals, and specifics of each portion of the budget. A
public hearing was held Nov. 20 for citizen comments on any aspect of the
budget. After opening a public hearing during which there were no citizen
comments, the board unanimously approved the ordinance for the 32-page 2007
budget, which included the new capital projects building fund.

Total revenue is $3,334,026. Total expenditures are
$3,667,882. The beginning fund balance is $902,993. The ending balance is
$569,137. After reductions are made for the TABOR reserved fund balance of
$95,890 and the 15 percent reserve fund recommended by the General Accounting
Standards Board of $463,440, the end-of-year reserve is $9,807.
 
2007 appropriation ordinance approved
 
The board unanimously approved an ordinance that appropriated
the specific amounts required for each fund within the 2007 budget. There was no
public comment on the appropriation during the open hearing. The amounts
appropriated in the eight funds were:

 General Fund$3,667,882 Community Development Fund$22,000 Conservation Trust Fund$34,175 Debt Service Fund$167,813 Storm Drainage Impact Fee Fund$46,100 Traffic Impact Fee Fund$104,600 Water Enterprise Fund$2,192,390 Capital Projects Building Fund$1,109,043 
 
BOT meeting schedule for 2007 unanimously approved
 
Board meetings are normally held on the first and third
Monday of the month. If a meeting date falls on a holiday, the meeting is
normally held the following day. The board concurred on cancellation of the
first regular meeting in January. The other scheduled Tuesday meetings for 2007
are Jan. 16, Feb. 20, and Sept. 4.
 
IGA with Pikes Peak Rural Water Authority unanimously approved
 
The Palmer Divide Water Group has been converted to the Pikes
Peak Rural Water Authority. The board had previously approved a Memorandum of
Understanding to convert the water group into the new entity. The
intergovernmental agreement establishes the rural water authority. Membership
fees and required funding are the same. All funds held by the water group were
transferred to the authority.

The other members of the new rural water authority are: Town
of Palmer Lake, Cherokee Metropolitan District, Triview Metropolitan District,
Academy Water and Sanitation District, Donala Water and Sanitation District, and
Woodmoor Water and Sanitation District.
 
Three appointments unanimously approved
 
Monument resident Claudia Whitney, an alternate member of the
towns Board of Adjustment, was appointed to replace former Planning
Commissioner John Kortgardner, who has moved out of Monument to Colorado
Springs. Town Attorney Gary Shupp said that there would be no conflict of
interest due to Whitney being a town employee, because the boards actions are
reviewed by the District Court rather than by the Board of Trustees. The
resolution to appoint Whitney passed unanimously.

Trustee Gail Drumm was unanimously appointed town
representative to the Rocky Mountain Rail Authority by resolution. Town Manager
Cathy Green was unanimously appointed as the alternate representative in this
resolution. These two appointments expire after the April 2008 municipal
election
 
Two Monument Marketplace plats unanimously approved
 
Filing 11 of the Monument Marketplace is a single lot of
0.903 acre, adjacent to Jackson Creek Parkway. A fast-food restaurant, Carls
Jr., will build on this site. Filing 13, a single lot of 2.7 acres on the west
side of the center near I-25, will be a Texas Roadhouse. Both filings had been
unanimously approved by the Planning Commission on Nov. 8. There were no
conditions to the boards unanimous approvals.
 
RV parking restriction ordinance continued
 
The board had asked the staff to draft a restriction on
overnight parking of recreational vehicles in off-street parking, particularly
at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart objected to being singled out in the third amendment to
the Monument Marketplace Site Plan, the method initially proposed for
implementation of the policy. The corporation asked the town for an ordinance
that would apply town-wide. During recent Planning Commission and BOT
discussions on this topic, Town Attorney Shupp had also recommended an ordinance
applicable throughout the town.

The staff offered a draft amendment to the town ordinance at
this meeting that would prohibit the overnight parking of occupied recreational
vehicles in off-street parking lots, from dusk to dawn. Some of the unresolved
issues were safety, enforcement, and town aesthetics.

Some of the comments made by trustees and staff during a
very lengthy discussion follow:

Trustee Drumm asked that an exception be made for church
parking lots and residential private driveways. He said the town would lose
revenue from Wal-Mart and other nearby stores and restaurants to the Castle Rock
and North Academy Boulevard Wal-Mart shopping centers that allow overnight
parking. He noted that Wal-Mart requires drivers to sign a list within the store
when they stay overnight and could restrict the number allowed.

Town Manager Green said that unlit office building parking
lots had been a concern in drafting the language. She suggested that the board
could consider designating specific locations on parking lots in town where RVs
and campers can park, based on them not fitting in normal size spaces, to
control illumination and their visibility to police patrols. However, she said
it might be unfair to change parking requirements after Wal-Marts final plat
and PD site plan have already been approved and the town would have to pay for
signs designating authorized RV/camper areas or prohibiting overnight parking.

Trustee Miller said that he was considering withdrawing
support for the proposed ordinance due to all the complexities it may raise for
the towns Police Department. He added that people plan their trips around
these overnight stays at Wal-Marts and did not see how the department could
enforce the new ordinance fairly. He questioned the safety of awakening people
and requiring them to move their RVs in the middle of the night.

Trustee Tommie Plank said she would like to have Police Chief
Jake Shirk tell the board what the Police Departments issues and concerns
would be if RVs could park overnight at the Marketplace Wal-Mart.

Trustee Dave Mertz said allowing Wal-Mart parking would hurt
existing campground businesses in the area and harm the aesthetics of Jackson
Creek. Other trustees noted that the RVs could probably not be seen from I-25 or
any Jackson Creek homes.

Monument Police Detective Mark Owens said that RV owners
typically do not present problems. Due to other duties, police would be unlikely
to ask owners to move until after midnight.

The ordinance was continued until Chief Shirk could be
present.
 
Liquor licenses approved
 
The board unanimously approved a one-year renewal for the
liquor license of Brinker Restaurant Corp., owner of the Chilis Grill and Bar
in Monument Marketplace. There had been no liquor violations during the
preceding year.

The board unanimously approved a new liquor license for the
Rotelli Pizza Pasta restaurant in Monument Marketplace. Attorney Larry Gaddis
and surveyor Sue Duffy-Schwall of Liquor Licensing Professionals, LLC, gave very
brief presentations for the applicant, Rotelli Store Partners No. 2, LLC. The
board unanimously approved the new license with a single condition for a clean
report from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation on the corporate officers
and registered managers fingerprints.
 
Two payments over $5,000 unanimously approved
 
 $6,197 to One Stop Cop Shop for outfitting new police
 vehicles with equipment $89,034 to Bosco Contructors, Inc., for capital project
 work performed at the expanded water treatment facility at Second Street and
 Beacon Lite Road 
 
Priorities sought for capital projects
 
Green presented a draft Capital Improvement Program document
that listed 14 projects that the town should consider completing within
approximately 10 years. She suggested that the board should pick the projects it
would fund within the next three to five years. Smith said a capital expense
would be any item that exceeds $5,000 and that may be depreciable. Green asked
the trustees to review her draft list after the meeting and suggest any
additions to her.
 
Masse again asks for license renewal for concrete plant
 
Town Attorney Shupp reported that the Masse/Rockwell business
license issue has been revived. Kalima Masse has again asked for&quot;renewal&quot;of a business license for the concrete batch plant on the
northeast corner of Highway 105 and Washington Street. The plant has not been
operated for nearly 20 years. A previous denial of the application led to a
lawsuit that Masse lost.

Shupp noted that the second license application was also
denied. Masse asked for an appeal 25 days later. The ordinance allows only 10
days for an appeal. Masse has submitted another application. The attorney
provided to the town by the towns insurer has suggested mediation of the
issue to Masse rather than a formal town hearing. Green would preside over the
appeal hearing if the mediation offer is not accepted by Masse.

Director of Development Services Tom Kassawara said he hoped
to have a recommendation for the general engineer and design-builder for the new
Town Hall/Police Station project at the next BOT meeting.

The meeting adjourned at 7:45 p.m.

 
 
 Monument Board of Trustees, December 18: Contract
negotiations to begin on new Town Hall/Police Department facility
 
By Jim Kendrick
 
On Dec. 18, during the last board meeting of the year, the
Monument Board of Trustees (BOT) authorized town staff to begin negotiations for
engineering services contracts for 2007 as well as for the design and
construction of the new Town Hall/Police Department facility. The board also
discussed the current status of the proposed town-subsidized senior center on
Highway 105. Trustee Tim Miller was absent.

Mayor Byron Glenn announced that expansion of the states
I-25 Baptist Road interchange would begin in March. He said a construction
manager for the project would be selected at a Baptist Road Rural Transportation
Authority (BRRTA) meeting that was scheduled for Dec. 21. (The BRRTA meeting
was actually delayed until Dec. 22 due to snow. The $1,692,703 construction
management contract was awarded to Carter and Burgess, Inc.)
 
BRRTA voters passed a temporary 1-cent, 20-year sales tax on
Nov. 7 to pay for private funding of the interchange expansion with $21.5
million of general obligation revenue bonds. The construction contract will be
awarded early in 2007. This sales tax will begin July 1. The El Paso County
Department of Transportation will administer the construction contract for BRRTA,
in coordination with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).

CDOT has promised to pay back BRRTA $15 million in principal
for the cost of construction if and when Colorado Senate Bill 1 funds become
available. The sales tax will end, probably in fewer than 20 years, once the
interest and principal are paid off from generated tax revenue, or if CDOT pays
BRRTA the $15 million as promised in the next five to 10 years. (See BRRTA
article on page 26 for more details.)
 
Trustee Gail Drumm, the towns representative to the Front
Range Rail Authority, said the authority and CDOT were initiating a study on
where high-speed passenger rail lines should be installed along the Front Range.

State Sen. Tom Wiens, who represents the Tri-Lakes region,
offered his assistance on local matters during the upcoming 120-day legislative
session. He thanked the town for its efforts to get the Baptist Road interchange
privately funded well before the state could pay for the construction.&quot;Its
a big deal you can all be very proud of.&quot;
 
Four engineering service contracts approved
 
Director of Development Services Tom Kassawara said 11
requests for qualifications were sent to engineering firms on Sept. 19 that the
staff had identified for consideration for future on-call service contracts for
2007. He said nine responses were received, and the staff selected the four most
qualified firms for contract offers. Kassawara said their expertise overlapped,
which would give the staff choices for particular services at the most
reasonable cost. The negotiated contracts will all have maximum fees listed so
that no bids will be required for work and the staff can pick the consultant
firm that will give the best service for the best price.

Kassawaras proposed resolution asked for approval to enter
contract negotiations with four firms for the following engineering services:

 Ayres Associatesdrainage and drainage-related projects
 and studies, water supply Stantec Consultants, Inc.roadways, utilities, water
 and wastewater treatment, and miscellaneous civil engineering tasks Nolte Associates, Inc.miscellaneous civil engineering
 tasks, roadways, utilities, water and wastewater treatment, and drainage and
 drainage-related projects and studies, water supply Carter and Burgess, Inc.water and wastewater
 treatment, drainage and drainage-related projects and studies, utilities,
 miscellaneous civil engineering tasks, roadways. 

Trustee Travis Easton, a civil engineer who works for Nolte
Associates, Inc., stated he would recuse himself. Glenn said he works with
Stantec Consultants and would recuse himself on that vote. With these two
abstentions, a resolution authorizing all four contract negotiations by staff
was unanimously approved by the other four trustees.
 
Design-build contract approved
 
Kassawara said he had advertised for contractors who could
design and construct the two-story, 17,000-square-foot Town Hall/Police
Department facility on town-owned land on the southwest corner of Beacon Lite
Road and Highway 105. Only one proposal was submitted on Dec. 6, by the team of
developer Centennial Services, Inc., general contractor Alexander Building,
Inc., and architect John P. Nelson Associates. Kassawara said the team had the
qualifications necessary to build the facility within the $2.9 million budget
and complete it within 12-14 months. He asked the board for permission to begin
negotiations with Centennial Services for a design-build contract that
establishes a guaranteed maximum price, a schedule for completion, and a&quot;B+&quot;level of quality. The board unanimously approved a resolution for
the negotiations. Kassawara will bring the negotiated contract back to the board
for final approval.
 
Landreth appointed water authority representative
 
The board unanimously approved a resolution appointing Public
Works Director Rich Landreth as the primary town representative to the new Pikes
Peak Regional Water Authority (which recently replaced the Palmer Divide Water
Group) and former Mayor Betty Konarski as the alternate. The first authority
meeting is scheduled for Jan. 9.
 
Seniors ask for status report on center
 
During public comment on items not on the agenda, President
Maureen Poirier of the Tri-Lakes Health Advocacy Partnership asked for
information on the proposed senior residence facility to be built on a
town-owned lot on Highway 105, east of Knollwood Drive. She said the board had
approved the donation of the land for this facility a year ago, but the
transaction had not yet taken place.

Poirier said it was her understanding that grant money for
the new facility would be jeopardized if the land was not transferred to the
developer by the end of 2006, when the available funding would expire. She said
that the town-appointed attorney for the donation had not responded to the
developers contract proposal after four weeks. She asked the board to advise
the community on how the situation would be resolved before the end of the year.

Green said she had prepared an additional packet for the
trustees on this item, which was then added to the agenda by unanimous approval
of the board.
 
Board expedites senior facility land donation
 
Green noted that last fall, the board had passed an ordinance
that authorized donation of a lot in the Village Center at Woodmoor development
on the southeast corner of Highway 105 and Knollwood Drive that was dedicated to
the town as a condition of the annexation of the 140-acre Wahlborg Addition. She
said a condition of the donation requires the developer to provide lowered rents
on at least 10 percent of the units for people with incomes below the median
regional income. Another condition for the donation was for the developer to
provide construction plans for the staff to review and approve as well as
financial statements that show financing plans are in order, which had not
occurred.

Green said that she was told on Dec. 15 that the developer
would lose its federal grant if the land was not transferred by Dec. 31. She
said she then checked with the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development on why the developers grant might be in jeopardy and learned that
no such grant application had been submitted by the developer. Green added that
she then learned that there may be some tax break for the developer if the land
donation is made in 2006 and some private investors&quot;may possibly walk
away&quot;if the proposal is not finalized very quickly.

Town Attorney Gary Shupp said that if the town was to
transfer the deed with a&quot;reverter clause&quot;and something occurs that
was not foreseen, there is a strong possibility of litigation for the town to
reclaim the land if the developer failed to fulfill its contract. He suggested
deeding the property in escrow, with appropriate conditions on the developer for
completion, before it would be released, signed, and transferred.

Shupp added that all of the details on the escrowed transfer
had not been worked out with the developers attorney. He said the board could
conditionally approve the escrow proposal. If the developers attorneys were
not to approve Shupps proposed contract, then the boards approval to
transfer the land would be revoked.

Green said the resolution she had presented to the trustees
would be changed after the meeting based on final negotiations.&quot;Theres
quite a bit of Trust me here in order for this to happen before the end of
the year. Otherwise we would definitely not have brought this to you. We would
have cleaned this up and would have brought it to you in January.&quot;

A time limit of nine months for good faith negotiations on a
final plat and engineering and development plans was discussed. Green said there
was a lot of engineering work to get done in that short a period. The board
unanimously approved a nine-month negotiating period with the developer and the
immediate, though escrowed, transfer of the property with the other conditions
noted above.
 
Three financial actions approved
 
Treasurer Pamela Smith asked for approval of four payments
over $5,000. One payment was to Triview Metropolitan District for its share of
the towns October sales taxes and November special ownership taxes on motor
vehicles. Three of the payments were money held in escrow by the town for the
future construction of a traffic signal at Knollwood and Highway 105 by WED, LLC,
the developer of the Village Center at Woodmoor. Smith noted that these three
checks were not the towns money, not an actual payment, and had no effect on
town fund balances.

 $100,285 to Triview: $94,582 in sales tax receipts;
 $5,703 for motor vehicle tax receipts $12,295 to WED for escrowed signal contribution of
 Integrity Bank $23,811 to WED for escrowed signal contribution of
 Monument Villas Tract A $12,295 to WED for escrowed signal contribution of
 Sundance Center 

The traffic signal construction is one part of the cost
allocation agreement that also calls for Highway 105 widening, turn lanes and
intersection improvements. The other parties to the agreement are Copper Knoll
Investments, LLC for the Knollwood Center; TKO Development/HWY 105, LLC; Paisano
LLC for the Tuscany Center; and WED, LLC for the Village Center at Woodmoor.

Green said the towns new cost-recovery ordinance would
prevent the town from being a party to this kind of private agreement in the
future. Kassawara said there will still disputes between the county and state
departments of transportation over transfers of roadway between the two and
further delays in the required approvals for actual construction of the needed
traffic signal.

The board unanimously approved the four payments.
 
Early loan payment approved
 
Smith proposed an additional early payment of $250,000 to pay
down principal on the towns loan for the Monument Dam to save over $200,000
in interest and pay off the loan three years earlier. This money was part of the
recent budget restatement showing surpluses due to increased revenues and
decreased expenditures in the water enterprise fund. Trustee Gail Drumm had
asked Smith at the Nov. 20 BOT meeting to consider using the money instead for
purchasing of water rights. Green said the towns water attorney, Bob Krassa,
had since advised her there was no need to purchase water rights in 2006, and
only $40,000 was needed in 2007 to buy a water right necessary for future
negotiations on others. Smith noted that this $40,000 had already been included
in the approved 2007 budget and there was a large contingency fund balance
should water rights be available at the right price.

The pre-payment of the water loan was approved 5-1, with
Glenn stating that the money should be held in reserve to&quot;keep options
open&quot;in the future.

Smith summarized a 29-page financial report for the first 10
months of 2006. She reported that general fund revenues were 17 percent ahead of
budget and water enterprise fund revenues were 8 percent behind, after setting
aside the $2.5 million for the new Town Hall/Police Department facility. General
fund expenditures are 5 percent over the budget and water enterprise fund
expenditures are 42 percent under. Sales tax revenues through August were 7
percent ahead of budget. The report was unanimously approved.
 
Concrete plant denied again
 
Shupp reported that Kalima Masse had rejected the towns
offer of mediation on her third application for renewal of a business license
that expired 19 years ago for the inactive concrete batch plant on the northeast
corner of Highway 105 and Washington Street. The town then sent her a third
denial.

Masse recently abandoned her unsuccessful three-year appeal
of the towns rejection of her first application. Masse then resubmitted the
same request. The town also denied that renewal request. Masse did not appeal
this second denial within the new 10-day limit enacted by a recent amendment of
the towns business license ordinance.

Shupp said that the town currently has no minimum time limit
on when an applicant can resubmit a new application for a previously rejected
use. The town is unable to stop her from immediately re-applying after each
rejection.

Shupp added that if she appeals the third rejection, the town
would be obliged to hold an appeal hearing for her. Green would be the hearing
officer for the appeal under another new amendment of the towns business
license ordinance

Kassawara reported that he had hired Joe Otkean, an
engineering inspector with over seven years experience in this field, to start
work on Jan. 8. The current inspector, Ron Rathburn, will return to the Water
Department.
 
Skateboard park options explored
 
Landreth gave a report on the first skateboard park meeting
he had held with area youths and parents. He said the kids did not like the
current location of the park. They wanted a larger park built within Dirty Woman
Creek Park, which would cost about $500,000. A park of this size would require
two years to design, plan, and fund through grants and fundraising events. He
asked if the board wanted to go ahead with reconstruction of the existing park;
the board did not make a decision. The next committee meeting will be held on
Jan. 10.

The committee also proposed building a skateboard park on the
YMCA parcel northwest of the Higby intersection with Jackson Creek Parkway.
Kassawara said that the current site plan proposal was&quot;already
packed.&quot;
 
Joint police actions with Palmer Lake advance
 
Police Chief Jake Shirk introduced Palmer Lakes new Police
Chief Dan Gilliana. Shirk described an&quot;exciting&quot;first joint venture
that was conducted with Palmer Lake after Gilliana took office.

In early December, Monument PD Officers arrested Trenton
McCall of Palmer Lake on suspicion of theft and other violations after receiving
a report of shoplifting from Wal-Mart. Monument detectives obtained a search
warrant for McCalls residence in Palmer Lake.

The El Paso County SWAT Team searched the home Dec. 16 and
officers and deputies seized drug paraphernalia, a small amount of marijuana,
and one ounce of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of
$3,500. Robert McCall was arrested on drug counts and jailed. An arrest warrant
was issued for Jerry Lynn McCall. Anyone with knowledge of his location should
call the Monument Police Department at 719-481-3253 or Palmer Lake Police
Department at 719-481-2934.

Shirk said the united efforts of area law enforcement
agencies will prove more successful in combating illegal drugs and their role as
the underlying source of many crimes in the Tri-Lakes area. Gilliana said the
policies and procedures manuals for the two towns were being aligned and
streamlined for more effective joint actions. He said the towns will also
standardize rules and training.
 
Other matters
 
Green suggested the town consider initiating a recreation fee
to help pay for little-league fields for players 5-17 years old.

She proposed leasing the current Town Hall building for $1
senior center lunches for the first year after the staff move out of the
building while working out the buildings future uses and the ability to fund
its continued operation with grants.

Glenn said the town should form a charter committee on a
proposal for home-rule status. Shupp said he would research the timing of the
committees requirements.

During citizen comments, Margaret French thanked the board
for moving forward on the resolution for the land donation for the senior center
on Highway 105.

The meeting adjourned at 7:45 p.m.

**********

The next meeting will be at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 16, in
Town Hall, 166 Second St. Meetings are normally held the first and third Mondays
of the month. Information: 481-2954.

On Dec. 13, the Monument Planning Commission approved plats
and site plans for the Monument Ridge mixed-use center on the southeast corner
of Baptist Road and Jackson Creek Parkway and the Copper Heights residential
development on the northeast corner of Leather Chaps and Bowstring Drives. The
commission also approved Filing 14 of the Monument Marketplace and a proposed
minor wording change in the towns ordinance on land use public hearing
notifications that would allow separate Planning Commission and Board of
Trustees public notice cycles.

Commissioner Kathy Spence was absent. Commissioner John
Kortgardner had resigned and had not been replaced.

Prior to the first hearing, the commission voted unanimously
to continue the scheduled hearing on the fourth amendment of the Monument
Marketplace Final Planned Development (PD) Site Plan until the next regular
meeting on Jan. 10.
 
Monument Ridge proposals approved

Background: Wal-Mart first proposed construction of a
supercenter on this Baptist Road site, coupled with annexation of the 30-acre
parcel by Monument, in 1999. Discussions never led to any town hearings, and
eventually Wal-Mart applied to El Paso County.

A modified Wal-Mart Supercenter proposal was rejected by the
county Planning Commission (7-1) on May 11, 2004, after a six-hour hearing. This
Wal-Mart proposal was unanimously rejected by the Board of County Commissioners
after an 11-hour hearing on July 15, 2004.

Some of the issues raised at the Wal-Mart hearings were:

 Inadequate road access Lack of adequate funding for necessary road and
 interchange improvements Concerns about drainage from 25 acres of flat impervious
 surface Concerns about the proposed intense 24-hour activity at a
 regional supercenter despite the countys long-established mixed-use
 zoning for the parcel that restricted the site to smaller-scale community
 commercial uses 

These issues shaped the Monument Ridge proposal by developer
AP Baptist Road LLC. The new Monument Ridge proposal called for annexation, PD
rezoning, and a mix of smaller scale commercial buildings (retail stores and
offices) plus multi-family housing on the southeast corner of the parcel as a
buffer for the adjacent Chaparral Hills five-acre residential lots. While most
concerns expressed by citizens at the county Wal-Mart hearings were addressed,
concerns about traffic loading on Baptist Road and the interchange remained.
 
Prior approvals: Annexation and PD zoning were
unanimously approved by the Monument Planning Commission on Sept. 28, 2005.

The PD sketch plan only defined the land uses and maximum
allowable densities being proposed. Until recently, all Monument annexation
requests were accompanied by final PD site plans. The only written comments
received by staff were from the towns traffic engineering consultant, SEH,
Inc. The SEH report recommended against approving the developers request that
the Jackson Creek Crossing intersection on Baptist Road be converted to a
full-motion intersection with left-turns allowed in all four directions. Jackson
Creek Crossing is the existing private road that is the right-in/right-out-only
access to the King Soopers center from westbound Baptist Road.

A private internal road, aligned with the existing Jackson
Creek Crossing, will extend southward from the eastern Monument Ridge access to
Baptist Road. This interior road, called Monument Ridge Road, will extend
through the commercial and future residential areas to the southern full-motion
access on New Struthers Road. It will also be the primary access to the
undefined residential area. The northern access to New Struthers Road and the
western and eastern accesses to Baptist Road will be right-in/right-out-only.

There will be no traffic signal at the Jackson Creek
Crossing/Monument Ridge Road intersection. County standards require a minimum of
half-mile spacing between traffic lights on major county arterial roads. The
separation between Jackson Creek Crossing and Jackson Creek Parkway is only 870
feetmuch less than the required half mile (2,640 feet.)

A median will be installed on Baptist Road that extends from
the I-25 bridge to east of Desiree Drive. Dedicated left-turn lanes will be
built to allow vehicles turning left from eastbound Baptist Road to go north on
Jackson Creek Crossing or from westbound Baptist Road to go south on Monument
Ridge Road. Left turns from Jackson Creek Crossing and Monument Ridge Road onto
Baptist Road will be blocked by the new median structures.

At the Sept. 2005 hearing, Commissioner Lowell Morgan voted
against the PD Sketch Plan, noting there was no resolution of the limited
capacity of the states two-lane Baptist Road bridge over I-25. (See www.ourcommunitynews.org/v5n11.htm#monpc for details) 

The Board of Trustees (BOT) approved annexation, rezoning,
and the PD Sketch Plan on Dec. 5, 2005.

At that hearing, Town Manager Cathy Greens staff report
noted that the towns traffic consultant, SEH, Inc.,&quot;had expressed
concern over the location of the full movement turn on Baptist Road&quot;at
Jackson Creek Crossing. Green said that the town would support the Monument
Ridge developers attempts to have the county reverse its position against a
traffic light and full-motion intersection on Baptist Road at Jackson Creek
Crossing.

Mayor Byron Glenn has also advocated this plan at a variety
of town and county public and private meetings. He has often said that Monument
would annex Baptist Road after all of BRRTAs and PPRTAs improvements are
completed and install a full-motion intersection and traffic light at Jackson
Creek Crossing. This proposed new traffic light would also relieve loading of
the western access of the King Soopers Center on Jackson Creek Parkway.

A condition was added to the annexation ordinance that
required the developer to escrow the parcels share of future costs for a
full-motion intersection at Jackson Creek Crossing.

Greens report also noted that Triview Metropolitan
District&quot;has issues with water, which is deficient on this site, as well
as questions about topography and site layout.&quot;However, Triview has
included this parcel because of its sales tax revenue potential.

Conditions added to the Monument Ridge annexation ordinance
were:

 AP Baptist Road, LLC, must donate right-of-way and
 provide temporary construction access to the Baptist Road Rural
 Transportation Authority (BRRTA) during county construction of Baptist Road
 improvements. AP Baptist Road must donate right-of-way and temporary
 construction access to Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority (PRRTA)
 during county construction of New Struthers Road. The Monument Ridge property must remain a part of BRRTA
 and comply with BRRTA regulations as long as the Authority exists. AP Baptist Road must escrow funds to the town at the time
 of subdivision of the property to finance a proportional share of a
 full-motion traffic light on Baptist Road at Jackson Creek Crossing, based
 on the trip generation within the development. A signed inclusion agreement between AP Baptist Road and
 Triview Metropolitan District must be part of the annexation agreement. 
 
(See http://www.ourcommunitynews.org/v6n1.htm#bot1205 for details)
 
At its March 10, 2006, meeting, BRRTA abandoned its proposal
for a voluntary 1 percent public improvement fee to expand the interchange due
to the refusal of Wal-Mart to allow its Monument Marketplace store to
participate. Wal-Marts new corporate policy was that BRRTA and/or Monument
voters should vote to impose a 1 percent sales tax rather than have Wal-Mart ask
its customers for a 1 percent fee, contrary to its previous agreement to collect
a 3 percent fee for road improvements during its county hearings in 2004. Home
Depot and Kohls also refused to participate voluntarily. (See http://www.ourcommunitynews.org/v6n4.htm#brrta for details.)
 
There have also been construction delays in both the Baptist
and New Struthers Road projects adjacent to the Monument Ridge parcel, primarily
due to Mountain View Electric Association and Qwest not moving their underground
utilities on schedule, particularly at the northeast corner of the Monument
Ridge property. Final determination of the grading of the steep slope along
Baptist Road at the property line between Monument Ridge and Family of Christ
Lutheran Church was delayed by the utilities concern over its new easements.
Other utility delays are expected in all three road projects. The countys
construction contractor, Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt, has worked on
other aspects of both road projects during these utility delays.
 
Bridge funding logjam broken: BRRTAs property owners
voted for a 1 percent temporary sales tax by mail-in ballot during the recent
November election to privately finance interest payments on road construction
bonds for a new eight-lane interchange bridge and widened ramps that will be
built by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT). Expansion of the
interchange will now be performed in conjunction with the ongoing county
improvement projects for Baptist Road and New Struthers Road, saving millions of
dollars by avoiding temporary Baptist Road construction and demolition work
between the interchange and the Jackson Creek Parkway intersection.

On Nov. 20, BOT passed an ordinance defining a cost-recovery
mechanism for required infrastructure (including new traffic signals) that
benefits developers who do not build on their properties until after the
infrastructure is installed.
 
Monument Ridge plat approved
 
Director of Development Services Tom Kassawara and Principal
Planner Karen Griffith presented the staff report on the proposals. Kassawara
said the developer had addressed all staff inputs. Griffith then reviewed the
plat and site plan proposals.

The plat depicts 10 commercial lots, one office lot, one
large medium-density residential lot, and a separate detention pond lot. No
plans have been made regarding the residential area; it will be subdivided in
the future. The landowners will dedicate land to the town for a half-acre pocket
park, similar to those in Jackson Creek developments. The location and design of
the pocket park will be determined at future hearings on the site plan for the
residential lot.

The gross commercial area of the parcel is 17.8 acres, the
gross residential area is 8.1 acres, the right-of-way area dedicated to the
county for Baptist Road and Struthers Road is 3.1 acres, and the detention pond
on the southwest corner of the parcel is 1 acre. There are 4.5 acres of open
space throughout the property. The initially proposed gas station has been
deleted; no users were identified by the developer.

The exterior designs of the three proposed buildings, a
Fairfield Inn hotel, a Walgreens drug store, and a Chase bank, were included
in the PD site plan.

Public access to the parcel will be provided by internal
private roads, sidewalks that connect all 13 lots to Baptist Road and Struthers
Road, and a trail. A cash-in-lieu payment will be made to School District 20
rather than a land dedication. All required public utilities are available.

Griffith said the proposed plat and PD site plan meets all
town requirements. The design guidelines for the preliminary PD site plan call
for common:

 roof colors brick, stucco, and stone veneers decorative sidewalk sections special sidewalk textures for pedestrian crossings for
 traffic quieting landscaping exterior accessories such as benches, fences, common
 signage displays, and bike racks. 

There were no significant issues referred to the town by
other agencies. Griffith proposed the towns standard condition that all
necessary technical corrections are to be made to the final plat and approved by
the staff prior to recording.

Griffith noted that U.S. Fish and Wildlife had expressed some
concerns about lighting and activity levels affecting nearby protected Prebles
mouse habitat. She said the new town ordinance requiring a photometric grid and
lighting plan for the parcel would resolve the issue. She also reminded the
commissioners that none of the Monument Ridge property is mouse habitat.
 
Another Jackson Creek Crossing issue is raised: Kassawara
said one minor issue between the developer traffic consultant, LSC
Transportation Consultants, and the towns traffic consultant, SEH, Inc., had
not yet been resolved. Kassawara said that SEH was concerned that motorists
exiting Monument Ridge to go east on Baptist Road from the western
right-in/right-out-only access would try to make a U-turn at the Jackson Creek
Crossing intersection to go west on Baptist Road. There will be three westbound
lanes at this uncontrolled intersection after the widening construction is
completed, two through lanes and an acceleration lane, which would provide
enough room for a U-turn.

Temporary barriers have recently been installed in the center
of the current temporary roadway at this intersection to try to prevent left
turns from eastbound Baptist into the King Soopers center, as well as outbound
left turns to go east on Baptist Road. Vehicles turning left through them have
knocked down several. Previously, a concrete median physically prevented these
left turns into and out of the center.

Kassawara said he had proposed internal signage throughout
the 30-acre parcel that would direct motorists wishing to go west on Baptist
Road to exit at the southern Monument Ridge Road access onto northbound New
Struthers Road, then turn left at Baptist Road. Kassawara added that this issue
needed to be resolved prior to the hearing for the final PD site plan.

Griffith and Kassawara added that there were no developer
issues with any of the many staff comments. The six conditions they had proposed
for the preliminary PD site plan were technical in nature.

Planning consultant Perry Thomas of Thomas&amp;Thomas gave
the formal developer presentation. The developers consultant architect, Jim
Nikai, described the design elements that are required to provide a common theme
when future development on the parcel is proposed. Marriott consultant Kevin
Inglehart described the franchising process for its two proposed hotels.

Commissioner Tom Martin asked numerous detailed questions
about the appearance of the three proposed buildings, shielded exterior building
and parking lot lighting, pedestrian circulation, infrastructure, and the
pedestrian plaza. Developer consultants and town staff pointed out where the
information had been provided in the plat and site plan. Martin also asked staff
to summarize the Jackson Creek Crossing traffic signal controversy.

Commissioner Carl Armijo expressed concerns about having both
hotels so close together, sharing a single parking lot. Kassawara noted that
this has become a standard industry practice over the past five years. He listed
several Colorado cities with similar side-by-side configurations. He also noted
that the town had no legal options, much less retail expertise, to force the
developer to move either hotel or any other use on the parcel.

Commissioner Patricia Mettler said she was concerned about
the viability of the proposed hotels, given the failures of Falcon Inn under
several owners. She also asked why the drug store on Highway 105 had failed.
Kassawara said there is a lot more activity on Baptist Road and better access
than for Falcon Inn. He noted that this Rite Aid drug store was successful but
was closed due to a Rite Aid corporate policy decision to pull out of this
region.

The preliminary/final plat was unanimously approved with a
single standard town condition that all the remaining minor technical
corrections must be made and approved by town staff before the final plat is
recorded.
 
Citizens comment on site plan: During the public hearing
on the preliminary PD site plan, Chaparral Hills resident Pete McKinney asked
for details on the retaining wall between the Lutheran Church and the parcel.
The light brown keystone retaining walls will be built in 6-foot-tall sections,
with landscaping buffers between each successive wall. Fencing will be composed
of cast stone pillars with aluminum fencing. Griffith said that landscape
buffers will be provided along the eastern and southern boundaries of the
parcel.

Chaparral Hills resident Debbie Grandia asked if the natural
topography of the parcel would be leveled. Thomas said that each of the building
pads would be terraced in a stair-step fashion to follow the existing contours
of the parcels.

Martin initiated another lengthy discussion of changing the
design of the pedestrian plaza. After considering several options, there was
consensus that a proposal from the developer would be required for the next site
plan hearing. Armijo asked for a separate condition to have an additional
traffic analysis performed to resolve the two issues raised by SEH regarding the
Jackson Creek Crossing intersection on Baptist Road.

The preliminary PD site plan was unanimously approved with
eight conditions:

 More landscaping will be added along Baptist Road; the
 changes made by staff must be added to the landscape plan portion of the PD
 site plan; specifications will be added to the preliminary PD site plan for
 a colored and patterned concrete strip to be installed between the sidewalk
 and curb along Baptist Road and Struthers Road. Numerous technical changes must be made to the design
 guidelines for the parcel and then be approved by staff. Documentation will be provided showing that all minor
 issues raised by several referral agencies have been resolved to the
 satisfaction of staff. A master signage plan will be submitted and approved by
 staff before any sign permits are issued. All minor technical corrections to the preliminary PD
 site plan, design guidelines, and zoning regulations shall be made and then
 approved by staff prior to final approval of the site plan. Approval is subject to final approval of engineering
 plans by staff. A revised design proposal for the pedestrian plaza will
 be submitted before hearings are conducted on the fourth lot to be
 developed. A traffic analysis for Baptist Road at the Jackson Creek
 Crossing intersection will be performed prior to hearings on the site plan
 for the next lot to be developed. 
 
Copper Heights plat and site plan approved
 
Griffith gave the staff report on both proposals. No citizens
were present for these public hearings.

The 53-lot, 13.67-acre Pulte Homes subdivision is on the
northwest corner of Leather Chaps and Bowstring Drives. The first phase of the
Remington Hills development is adjacent to Copper Heights to the east. Bowstring
Drive separates the two residential areas. There are two accesses to Bowstring
at the north and south ends of the parcel.

Land use breakdown:

 Residential lots 9.14 acres Right-of-way 3.88 acres Landscape buffer 0.22 acre Public park 0.64 acre Gross density 3.88 dwelling units per acre Net density 5.80 dwelling units per acre 

Lot sizes range from 6,050 square feet to 13,318 square feet,
with an average of 7,536 square feet.

The pocket park on the southeast corner of the parcel has
street frontages on Leather Chaps, Bowstring, and Butte Circle (the southern
access) to the north. This park and two other open space tracts will be
dedicated to Monument and maintained by Triview Metropolitan District

Griffith said staff had asked the developer to add a fence
around the perimeter of the pocket park.

Griffith said that the developer and MVEA had not agreed on
the width and location of electric utility easements. Originally, MVEA requested
10-foot-wide easements. The developer submitted a letter to staff saying MVEA
had verbally agreed to 7-foot-wide front yard easements. After that, MVEA
submitted a letter to staff that if the requested easements are not provided,
MVEA&quot;may not be able to provide services to the subdivision.&quot;She
reported that all the other unresolved issues raised by referral agencies are
technical and not significant.

Griffith reported Pulte had proposed some minor changes to
the road alignments adjacent to the development and in the vicinity. The staff
asked Pulte to request the changes to the Regency Park master plan via a PD
sketch plan application to be in conformance with the towns review and
approval process for planned developments.

Griffith reported the site plan was consistent with the
Regency Park PD and the towns Comprehensive Plan, citing 11 review and
approval criteria.

Griffith proposed two conditions for the preliminary/final
plat:

 Documentation shall be provided that referral agency
 comments have been resolved to staffs satisfaction prior to recording. Any necessary technical corrections shall be made to the
 satisfaction of staff. 

Commissioner Armijo asked if the proposed lot sizes were
consistent with those for existing houses in Remington Hills. Griffith said that
the Regency Park zoning for the first filing of Remington Hills is PRD-4 (four
houses per acre). The Regency Park zoning for the Copper Heights parcel is PRD-6
(six houses per acre). The Regency Park zoning for the undeveloped Remington
Hills filing adjacent to the north half of Copper Heights is PRD-6. The adjacent
parcel to the west is zoned PMD-10 (multi-family) and will probably be a
townhouse development.

Project Manager Darsey Nicklasson of Pulte Homes gave Pultes
developer presentation. She said that MVEAs request for an exclusive 10-foot
easement would unduly restrict options for front-yard landscaping. MVEA has not
required that large an easement in any other Jackson Creek development.

Pulte Vice President Todd Levitt said that gas and electric
lines are installed in a common 7-foot easement everywhere else in Jackson
Creek. He noted that the water and sewer easements were under the roads, and
phone and cable easements are in the back yards.

Jackson Creek Land Co. Development Manager Rick Blevins
confirmed Levitts statement and added that the town would create significant
problems for all future Jackson Creek development if it allowed a precedent to
be set for an exclusive MVEA easement, particularly with how close pad-mounted
transformers might be installed to individual homes. He noted that MVEA had not
asked for an exclusive 10-foot easement in the adjacent Remington Hills lots
under construction, even though these lots are much larger.

Kassawara said the staff agrees with Pulte, saying as little
as 3 feet would be adequate for electric and gas lines in a single trench.

Commissioner Mettler asked why the pocket park was located
near traffic on Leather Chaps and Bowstring Drives

Nicklasson said the location would make the park more visible
as a public park to all residents of Jackson Creek similar to the public park
adjacent to Creekside Middle School Moving it away from Leather Chaps would make
it seem like it was exclusively for the use of Copper Heights residents, as has
occurred in other Jackson Creek subdivisions. Also, it would be far more visible
to citizens and patrolling police, particularly at night, promoting prompt
reporting of problems. The major play areas are in the rear of the park and are
buffered by landscaping and a detached sidewalk.

Martin said that the Copper Heights lots were confined in a
manner unlike the other Jackson Creek developments. He said a community of
exclusively two-story houses would be unique. He noted that the existing
semi-custom Remington Hills homes adjacent to Copper Heights are much larger and
most are ranchers. Blevins said that the Remington Hills homes being built are
much bigger than expected. Martin asked if Pulte had a rancher product that
would fit on the proposed lots to provide greater variety. Levitt said no, and
that no developer could build a rancher in a similar development at an
acceptable price, because ranchers of the same square footage are more expensive
to build.

Armijo said the development would&quot;feel packed in&quot;because all the models are two stories and&quot;in my opinion the exterior lots
are too small.&quot;He also said,&quot;Im not quite sure that this is what
the town of Monument should look like.&quot;He said the park should be moved to
another location, away from the two collector roads.

Consultant Land Planner John Maynard of NES, Inc., disagreed,
saying that Copper Heights was a transition area between PRD-4 and PRD-10
parcels. Levitt said the cost of building ranchers in a PRD-6 zone next to a
collector road is prohibitive to buyers. Kassawara said that houses in the
mid-$300,000 range are appropriate to ensure a variety of housing prices in
Monument,&quot;the best you can do&quot;from a town planning standpoint.
Levitt said the prices of these homes would be considerably below the average
price of Monument homes, meeting the objective of the towns comprehensive
plan. Griffith said all the other projects recently approved by the town were
for even larger lots, creating a shortage of smaller lots to meet the existing
demand.

After considerable further discussion about various land
planning philosophical issues, the preliminary/final plat was approved (5-1)
with Armijo opposed. After more discussion about these same issues, the
preliminary/final PD site plan was approved (4-2) with Armijo and Martin
opposed.

The preliminary/final plat for filing 14 of Monument
Marketplace was unanimously approved. Blevins said this 3.54-acre 3-lot property
on the southeast end of the commercial center will be an auto service complex,
including a parts store and a lube center. There has been no interest in
building a gas station on the parcel.

Public notification ordinance revision narrowly approved:
Inconsistencies exist in the town code regarding whether or not a Board of
Trustees hearing can be advertised in a newspaper before a Planning Commission
hearing has been completed. There was a lengthy discussion about legal and
technical requirements, recent advertisements of hearings not being published on
the date requested by staff, efficient and expeditious scheduling of hearings,
and giving citizens full 15-day notice for a board hearing after the
recommendations of the Planning Commission are known. The proposed ordinance
revision to allow concurrent notice of Planning Commission and Board of Trustee
hearings was approved (4-2) with Armijo and Morgan opposed.

The meeting adjourned at 9 p.m.

 Palmer Lake Town Council Workshop,
December 7: 2007 budget and alternatives for refilling the Lake discussed
 
By Jim Kendrick
 
The Palmer Lake Town Council held a special meeting at 6 p.m.
for an executive session on personnel issues on Dec. 7, before the regular
workshop meeting at 7 p.m. In addition to discussions of alternatives for
refilling Palmer Lake and the draft 2007 budget, the council received a lengthy
presentation on a proposed certified identity theft risk management service
program.
 
ID theft training and protection offered
 
Donna Jack and Peg Richardson of the Kroll Risk Consulting
Co. gave a 50-minute presentation on options they could offer town staff for
training on how to prevent identity thefts within the towns daily operations,
certification of this training, and legal services for defending the town from
claims for civil and criminal liability. They said identity theft is the
fastest-growing crime in the country. Although they said their basic coverage
would cost $13 per employee per month, they left no documentation for their
presentations or proposed fees for service for the trustees and staff to
analyze, due to what they said was the proprietary nature of their offer in a
very competitive industry.
 
Palmer Lake restoration still controversial
 
The Awake the Lake Committee asked the town for water
production records and a meeting with town water attorney Ronnie Sperling to
discuss the committees proposal to purchase new water storage rights in
Palmer Lake for the town. Chairman Jeff Hulsmann said the committee would pay
for a meeting with Sperling if it could set the agenda and list of questions
proposed to her. While the committee expects this session to be an open public
meeting, it wants enough control of the discussion to be sure its questions are
presented to Sperling.

The committee also offered to pay for filing for water
storage rights in the lake. Sperling would prepare the filing at the direction
of the council. Hulsmann said the filing fee would be $500 but the committee did
not know whether to budget $2,000 or $20,000 for the proposed hearings in water
court.

Hulsmann said the committee also wants to develop a strategy
for water augmentation and expanded water production to refill the lake. He
presented a letter to Mayor Max Parker and Water Trustee Jim Girlando that asked
for production statistics for four years (2003-06) for the towns A2 and D2
wells, and surface production of Anchor Ditch, the towns water system, and
the Glen Park reservoir. The committee also asked for a tour of the towns
water facilities. Hulsmann asked the council to commit to filing for storage
rights in the lake at the regular council meeting on Dec. 14.
 
Town will plow private south fork of Shady Lane
 
Roads Supervisor Bob Radosevich said that developer Tim
Shanks and other residents on the south fork of Shady Lane had asked the town to
plow this private road. Shanks is building a development at the top of the hill
on this one-block dead-end road and has regraded the road to withstand the loads
of heavy construction vehicles. Asphalt millings were to be laid down in late
November to stabilize the dirt road and minimize rutting and erosion. However,
spreading of the asphalt millings was cancelled due to recent blizzards. They
will not be applied until the spring. The town has not accepted ownership of the
road yet due to it not meeting town standards.

Radosevich said that there is more ice on the road now than
in previous years due to more traffic. The council approved plowing of the
still-private road on a time-available basis as a priority 3 roadway. Parker
reminded citizens that they use the private road at their own risk whether the
town plows it or not.
 
Final draft of 2007 budget reviewed
 
Parker said that consolidations of unnecessary line items had
reduced the length of the proposed 2007 budget from 31 to 22 pages. Estimated
sales tax revenue will increase from about $227,000 to about $248,000 due to the
temporary 10-year half-cent sales tax approved for the Palmer Lake Volunteer
Fire Department in the last election. The half-cent tax began on Jan. 1.

Town Clerk Della Gray said sales tax revenue for October was
up to $22,000 from previous years where the October revenue was $10,000 to
$12,000. Gray asked for any changes immediately so the final budget could be
approved on Dec. 14.

Fire Trustee Gary Coleman reported that the fire department
would be hiring an emergency medical technical for the new paid position for
weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. He also said there were two recent calls for
urgent emergency medical care at the southwest end of town. Both were
immediately assigned to the Tri-Lakes Fire Protection District ambulance for
treatment and transport.

Parker said the council needed to go into executive session
to discuss staff pay increases for 2007. The meeting went into executive session
at 8:30 p.m.

of Palmer Lake intends to continue this trend by hosting the Winter Fest. The
first one will be held at the lake on Jan. 26 from 5-8PM. Details about this
event can be obtained from Trish Flake, Palmer Lake Trustee of Parks and

By Jim Kendrick
 
The Palmer Lake Town Council approved ordinances for the 2007
budget and appropriation and certified the 2007 mill levy on Dec. 14. The
council also approved two additional appropriations for 2006 and an
intergovernmental agreement converting the towns membership in the Palmer
Divide Water Group to membership in its successor, the Pikes Peak Regional Water
Authority.

Police Trustee Trudy Finan introduced Dan Gilliana as the new
Palmer Lake police chief. Officer Mike Brennan had served as interim chief since
Dale Smiths retirement after more than 30 years in this position.

Gilliana has served in the police community since 1977 and
has been a part-time officer in Palmer Lake since 1999. He is leaving his job as
Criminal Justice Department chair at Colorado Technical University He also
served on the advisory board for the Pikes Peak Community College criminal
justice curriculum and related training programs.

Gilliana said he would continue the community-oriented police
program created by Smith long before it became a popular and commonly accepted
approach to relationships with citizens. Gilliana said his staff would add an
officer, participate in El Paso County Sheriffs Office in-service training,
work with Douglas County on vehicle maintenance, and have a closer working
relationship with the Monument Police Department.

Gillianas appointment was unanimously approved by the
council. He was sworn in by Finan to a warm round of applause.

Since Gillianas selection, Brennan and administrative
assistant Mary Kay Reed have resigned from the department for personal reasons.
 
Four budget ordinances and mill levy resolution approved
 
The council unanimously approved two ordinances that amended
the appropriations for the 2006 budget. Unused funds from the administration
budget ($4,860) and police budget ($11,811) were re-appropriated to the fire
budget for Palmer Lake Volunteer Fire Department (PLVFD). The fire budget was
increased by $16,671, from $42,140 to $64,256, to cover planned expenses through
the end of the year. Then the council approved a transfer of funds received from
a state grant of $5,445 to be paid to the Fire and Police Protective Association
pension fund by the town. This further increased the 2006 fire budget to
$69,701.

Town Clerk Della Gray said the increases were used to
purchase the new roof installed on the fire station. Additional funds were also
required to pay for part-time emergency medical technician coverage during
working hours on weekdays beginning in October after Tri-Lakes Fire Protection
District cancelled its emergency services agreement with PLVFD.

The town had also purchased an RV to provide temporary
on-duty living quarters for volunteer firefighters and medical personnel and
Larkspur Fire Protection District personnel under a new emergency services
agreement with that district. The RV has been installed behind Town Hall and
connected to the buildings utilities.

The council unanimously approved a resolution that certified
each of the 2007 property tax mill levies that will raise the following maximum
revenues:

 2.211 mills for bond interest $54,467 4.210 mills for redemption of bond #2 $105,531 10.057 mills for general purpose $248,207 16.544 mills (total) $408,305 

The certification had to be filed with El Paso County by Dec.
15.

The council unanimously approved the ordinance for the 2007
budget. While several of the funds have small reserves that were rolled over
from 2006 to 2007, only the general fund has an end-of-year balance for 2007.
The 2006 general fund end-of-year balance brought forward was $234,204. The
balance general fund balance drops slightly at the end of 2007 to $233,710.

The council unanimously approved the ordinance for the 2007
appropriations. The 14 appropriations (total) were:

 General $662,838 Water $555,182 Water Capital Improvements $393,610 Water Bond Debt $160,078 Road Improvement $237,103 Drainage Improvement $ 43,283 Police Supplemental (new) $ 75,000 Fire Supplemental (new) $ 75,000 Conservation Trust $ 67,867 Housing&amp;Urban Development $ 1,256 Special Investigations $ 24,662 Parks&amp;Recreation Donation $ 3,934 Lucy Owen Donation $ 33,648 Lake Maintenance $ 5,310 
 
Total $2,338,771

The council also unanimously approved the audit for 2005, an
unconditional/clean report.

The council unanimously approved an intergovernmental
agreement to become a member of the Pikes Peak Regional Water Authority for
2007. Unlike the predecessor, the Palmer Divide Water Group, an authority can
purchase water, water rights, storage, and storage rights, as well as accept
grants. All funds held by the water group were transferred to the authority. The
water authority membership fees are identical to those in 2006 for the water
group. Palmer Lake pays $2,500 per year.

The other members of the new rural water authority are: Town
of Monument, Cherokee Metropolitan District, Triview Metropolitan District,
Academy Water and Sanitation District, Donala Water and Sanitation District, and
Woodmoor Water and Sanitation District.

The Town of Palmer Lake is also a member of the El Paso
County Water Authority, which covers a much larger geographical area.
 
Reports
 
Roads Trustee Richard Allen reported that the total cost of
asphalt repaving for Middle Glenway and sealing of Epworth Highway and Lovers
Lane was $55,397. The magnesium chloride sealing and dust control program has
also been completed. Roads Supervisor Bob Radosevich also had $4,000 of
preventive maintenance work performed on the towns dump trucks.

Radosevich attended a workshop on new county asphalt
specifications, which should standardize and improve repairs. The city of
Colorado Springs is also adopting these specifications effective Jan. 1. Town
Attorney Larry Gaddis and Town Engineer Paul Gilbert will prepare an ordinance
that adopts these new specifications as the town standard before the town begins
repaving in 2007. Currently the town uses Douglas County road standards in its
construction manual.

Allen also reported that the construction and landscape
issues regarding developer Brad Kunkels property on Circle Road appeared to
be resolved as dirt and debris have been removed from three culverts. Allen
proposed rescinding the letter the town had sent Kunkel saying he would not be
allowed to start any more building in the development, even though he was issued
a town land use permit, until this issue was resolved.

Gaddis said the town should wait at least a year before
accepting Circle Road from Kunkel to see if there are any construction defects.
Ordinarily, a contractor would give the town a surety bond that would pay for
repairs of defects if the contractor failed to make them after one year.
However, Kunkels letter of credit to the town for this purpose has expired
since the town told him he could not start any new construction until this issue
was resolved.

The council unanimously agreed to the letter rescinding the
building ban and a one-year delay in taking ownership of Circle Drive within the
development.

Fire Trustee Gary Coleman reported that PLVFD had 15 calls in
November, 8 of which were for mutual aid of other fire districts.

PLVFD has established its program of providing paid part-time
daytime weekday coverage at the towns fire station to provide better service.
He said the new emergency services agreement with Larkspur was working well.

The department had turned on the town star for the first time
for Veterans Day on Nov. 11 and will do so in the future. The star is also lit
from Dec. 1 to Jan. 1. Maintenance of the star is paid for with funds raised by
the annual chili supper held the Saturday after Thanksgiving.

Coleman requested that property owners prominently place
house numbers in front of their homes to ensure prompt attention during a
medical emergency; there would be no smoke or flames to help guide PLVFD
drivers.

Coleman also reported that his model electric train Christmas
layouts were being displayed throughout December at the West End Center on
Highway 105. Donations made by those visiting the display will go to PLVFD. (See
photo on page 35.) 

Finan reported that there were 93 police calls for November,
down from 113 last November.

The board unanimously approved a one-year renewal of the towns
annual contract with the Pikes Peak Humane Society to pick up stray animals
reported to the Palmer Lake Police Department.

Parks and Recreation Trustee Trish Flake said she had met
with her committee on Dec. 5 and that a small park will be built at Greeley
Boulevard and Walnut Avenue. Evening ice skating from 5-8 p.m. at Palmer Lake
will start during the holiday season. The towns collection of ice skates was
to be available for rental.

The towns contract with athletic program consultant Great
Starts should be finalized soon. Great Starts will organize a wide variety of
athletic and exercise programs in Palmer Lake beginning in early 2007.
 
Emergency medical response examined
 
Flake asked the council to discuss a medical emergency call
that had occurred on Oct. 24 on Westward Lane with a list of dispatch calls and
times for that incident. She passed out an incident summary faxed from the
Tri-Lakes Fire Protection District that included information that should have
been protected by HIPAA procedures to protect the individuals privacy. Flake
said 9 minutes elapsed before Tri-Lakes was asked to respond to the call. She
said Tri-Lakes board member Rick Barnes told her Larkspur could not respond to a
Palmer Lake call in less than 12 minutes.

Flake said she had not received information on the first
month of dispatches from Larkspur, including this call, that she had requested
of Larkspur Chief Jamie Bumgarner on Nov. 6.

She said,&quot;I dont think the decision to go to
Larkspur was a good one.&quot;

Coleman said he had reported at the Dec. 7 workshop that
Tri-Lakes had been called for all dire emergencies near Tri-Lakes Station 1 in
November and that the town had hired part-time medical personnel for daytime
readiness in response to the previously unannounced road closures of Spruce
Mountain Road. Coleman said he had just been handed her listing and was not
prepared to respond to it. He questioned whether it was appropriate to pass out
this kind of private information at a public meeting or for the sheriffs
dispatch center to provide it to anyone other than emergency medical service
personnel. Coleman said it was inappropriate to talk about private information
such as peoples names, addresses, and medical problems in a public meeting,
something the Palmer Lake volunteer firefighters and town staff would not do.

Trustee Susan Miner said that there was nothing unusual about
this kind of incident from time to time. She said when the decision was made to
go with Larkspur there had been five reported cases where there were near
fatalities of Palmer Lake residents due to TLFPD medical technicians care.
She said that no decision should be made on a single incident.

Flake said that Larkspur does not have anybody nearly as
qualified as personnel in TLFPD. Allen said that the situation has changed since
the agreement with Larkspur, which now cannot provide a daily paramedic due to
the Spruce Mountain Road construction. He said it may be time to adjust the
Larkspur decision, based on these two new circumstances.

Miner said she had asked Allen and Flake to perform a
comprehensive long-term study, and they had refused to do so.

Mayor Max Parker said Flake should have requested an agenda
item so that the issue could be discussed in a more formalized manner rather
than being part of a Parks and Recreation report. Parker said it should be
tabled until Flake had supporting data and a proposed plan of action and it
could be advertised as an agenda item.

Coleman said PLVFD Chief Phillip Beckman had already solved
the transition problem discovered during this call.
 
Water meetings proposed
 
Water Trustee Jim Girlando said the town should hold a joint
public meeting with the Awake the Lake committee to encourage citizen
participation on action items by interested and knowledgeable volunteers for
lake restoration. He said another topic for the town to analyze is whether the
towns water capital fund reserve was growing fast enough under the current
rate structure to be able to pay for expected repair and replacement of aging
water mains.

Later in the meeting, Awake the Lake Committee Chairman Jeff
Hulsmann asked the town to support the committees efforts to obtain new water
storage rights as soon as possible. He renewed his request made at the Dec. 7
workshop for statistics for all aspects of water production for the past four
years to be better able to ask questions about potential committee options of
town water attorney Ronnie Sperling. He said the committee would pay for 1-2
hours of Sperlings time if they could set the meeting agenda. Miner said the
trustees should be provided this production data before the Sperling meeting as
well. She said her requests for this data had also been denied by staff. Allen
concurred with Miner.

Gaddis said that the Sperling meeting should be public and it
was acceptable for the committee to ask all its questions first. Girlando said
he wanted to have a separate special council meeting with the committee to
discuss these issues before meeting with Sperling. There was consensus on
providing this data to all concerned prior to the meetings proposed by Girlando
and Hulsmann. Hulsmann said&quot;Were making progress. Were on the same
page.&quot;

Economic Development Trustee Miner reported progress made by
the streetscape committee on identifying potential sources for grant money to
add curbs, gutter, and drainage along Highway 105 in front of all the buildings.
Hulsmann said he had been asked by PPACG to provide a draft Colorado Safe to
Schools grant applications on Dec. 19 so they could propose suggestions in time
for the town to submit them not later than Dec. 29. The grant would help pay for
sidewalks to promote childrens safety while walking to and from school.

Miner reported that all the artwork submitted for the&quot;Face of Palmer Lake&quot;art competition for inclusion in town
promotional materials would be displayed for a month at the Tri-Lakes Center for
the Arts on Highway 105 starting Dec. 15.

The meeting adjourned at 9:10 p.m.

 
 
 Donala Water and Sanitation District,
November 29: Wastewater facility expansion reaches first milestone
 
By Sue Wielgopolan
 
Donala general manager Dana Duthie announced at the boards
Nov. 29 meeting that the three new equalization basins within the Upper Monument
Creek Regional Wastewater Facility are almost fully functional. Completion of
the basins will mark the first milestone of the plant expansion.

The basins will store incoming wastewater during periods of
extremely high flow (such as those experienced during holidays) for processing
at a later time. In essence, this ability allows the facility to handle a larger
volume of wastewater at any given time. The plant is less limited by short-term
capacity, as peak flows that come in faster than they can be processed can be
diverted and handled during slack periods.

Duthie expressed concerns over the rapidly rising costs of
concrete, steel, copper, and other building materials. He said that the
expansion had already cost about $2 million, or roughly one-quarter of the
budget, but was only one-sixth complete.

Board members passed several important resolutions during
their last business meeting of 2006, including mill levy certification, approval
of the 2007 budget, and a resolution approving an addendum to an agreement with
El Paso County Parks waiving the requirement that parks deed over remaining
water rights to Donala in exchange for a tap. Members also voted to establish
and join a new regional water authority, and approved the authoritys first
tentative agreement with a water storage contractor.
 
Budget discussion
 
Board President Ed Houle opened discussions regarding the
2007 budget. Director Dennis Daugherty asked why the repair estimate for 2006
was so much lower than the amount actually spent. Duthie replied that the
district had to redrill two wells; in a normal year Donala budgets for two well
repairs, which are less expensive.

Duthie told the board that suspension of the districts
status as an enterprise would change the way Donala does its budget in
subsequent years. The district will no longer operate two separate accounts. In
the past, it divided income and expenditures into an enterprise fund and a
government fund. The enterprise was formed on the advice of Donalas attorney
at the time, who felt account separation would be the best way for the district
to conform to TABOR requirements.

While eliminating the enterprise account will have no real
effect on the way money is collected and spent, consolidation of all district
funds into one account will simplify bookkeeping and auditing.

Duthie also announced that the district will have sufficient
cash in its debt fund account to retire the 1999 loan for the purchase of and
improvements to the wastewater plant in February 2007. The debt cannot be
legally retired until 2009; funds will be held in a type of escrow account until
that time.

Donala customers voted in May to continue the temporary
12.810 portion of the mill levy earmarked to pay off the old waste plant debt,
converting it into a permanent mill levy dedicated to operation and maintenance
expenses. The money collected will be used first to pay off the loan for the
current waste plant expansion, then to fund projects to acquire and transport
surface and supplemental water to the district.
 
2007 budget approved
 
After Duthie answered questions, the board unanimously passed
a resolution adopting the 2007 budget. Duthie reminded them that since final
figures for the year would not be in until after Jan. 1, they would have to pass
a second resolution in January readopting the amended budget.

The directors also unanimously certified the mill levies for
the year. Most Donala residents will pay a mill levy (tax) of 16.296 mills in
2007, which will help cover operating expenses for water and sewer. Customers
receiving only water service, such as those in Chaparral Hills, will pay a lower
mill levy of 8.148 mills.
 
Homeowners associations in Gleneagle request more information
on watering restrictions
 
Duthie told the board he had received several comments on the
districts proposed watering restriction program, which is scheduled to begin
this summer. Most were against the use of watering schedules; however, one
applauded the move and stated that it was time Donala joined Colorado Springs
and other areas of the county in instituting conservation measures. Copies of a
few e-mails were enclosed in each board members monthly information packet.

Some homeowners associations in Gleneagle have requested that
a Donala representative speak to their respective groups to explain how to
comply with the restrictions, the reasoning behind the new rules, and what
Donala hopes to accomplish.

Duthie said he welcomes the opportunity to educate district
consumers about the new program. Speaking engagements will also give Duthie
and/or board members the chance to talk publicly about the success of similar
programs in other Front Range communities, as well as address the larger issue
of conservation, the future of water in the region, and actions the new Pikes
Peak Regional Water Authority is taking to provide a sustainable water supply.

Duthie said he would like to see the same issues addressed
regionally, and distributed an article he wrote for the Donala newsletter in
response to comments he had received regarding the overall water situation in
the Palmer Divide area, particularly as it relates to growth. In it, he assures
consumers that the Palmer Divide Water Group (PDWG) has been quietly working
behind the scenes to secure surface supplies.

Duthie stated that public awareness and support is important
to the success of future water projects, and he would like to see the activities
of the new water authority publicized. Board members then made suggestions to
refine the wording of the article before giving it their approval for
publication.
 
Transit loss model makes effluent sales more likely
 
At present, Donala only has two customers for its effluent
credits. The district has an agreement to sell credits to the town of Monument
at $50 per acre-foot. The town has applied to use credits for the water released
into Monument Creek by Donala through the Upper Monument Creek Regional
Wastewater Facility in trade for water it takes from the creek and stores in
Monument Lake. Any effluent credits not bought by Monument are sold to a farmers
cooperative for $25 per acre-foot.

Now that the transit loss model is operational and will track
water on a daily basis rather than monthly, the possibility for sales to other
customers has emerged. Cherokee Water District, which is a member of the PDWG
and will also be a member of the new water authority, may wish to purchase
water. A pipeline between Colorado Springs and Cherokee already exists. However,
any arrangement to sell water to Cherokee will involve the use of the citys
lines, which will require the citys cooperation.

Duthie said that the price discussed for the sale of water to
other authority members was $400 per acre-foot, including the agreement with
Monument. The asking price for customers outside the authority would be higher,
possibly $500 per acre-foot.
 
Donala approves establishment of regional water authority
 
Board members unanimously approved the intergovernmental
agreement establishing the new Pikes Peak Regional Water Authority (PPRWA), and
authorized membership in the group. The authority will replace the Palmer Divide
Water Group (PDWG), which will be dissolved upon official establishment of the
authority by a majority of participating member districts and municipalities.
Transition was expected to take place Jan.1. Members will probably elect
officers and determine other essential matters such as meeting place and dates
at the (former) PDWGs Jan. 9 meeting.

The directors nominated and approved Duthie to be their
representative.

As a state-sanctioned governmental body, the authority may
enter into contracts and fund projects. Representatives feel the collective
financial resources and political power provided by the formation of a single
entity is essential to the success of any plan to bring surface water to the
region.

The authority will be subject to many of the same rules to
which other governmental agencies must adhere, including open-meeting laws. The
group will need to select an administrative agent (Gary Barber, who managed the
Palmer Divide Water Group, is the likely candidate) and may also wish to hire
its own attorney and engineer.

The Donala board also unanimously approved the memorandum of
understanding (MOU) between Mark Morleys corporations (Stonewall Springs, LLC,
Phantom Canyon Ranch Land&amp;Cattle Co., and Morley Family Development, LLLP)
and the Pikes Peak Regional Water Authority. The MOU commits the group to
co-sponsorship of a feasibility study examining the cost and physical
practicality of building infrastructure to and modifying Brush Hollow Reservoir
for use as a storage and hydroelectric facility. The study includes Stonewall
quarry as part of the conveyance and storage system. In addition, the memorandum
states the authoritys intent to purchase storage capacity in the two
reservoirs for water the group hopes to acquire in the lower Arkansas.

While the agreement does not legally obligate the PPRWA to
purchase storage capacity at a price that is, at present, impossible to
determine, it does offer assurance of future inclusion in the project. The
approximately 15,000 acre-feet of storage needed by the authority represents
only a fraction of the total capacity of both reservoirs. By opting in at an
early point in planning, the PPRWA is assured that other larger customers will
not be able to exclude it at a later date.

However, Morley must have other buyers interested in
purchasing storage space in order to proceed with development. Colorado law
forbids speculation in water. In other words, a private individual is not
permitted to buy up water rights and sell later at a profit. Although the PPRWA
is a valid customer, the relatively small proportion of the total storage
capacity represented by northern El Paso Countys needs will probably be
insufficient in the eyes of Colorados water courts to justify approval of the
project.
 
Cost estimate for regional study surprises water providers
 
The cost estimate provided by hydrologic consulting firm
Bishop Brogden Associates (BBA) for a study identifying possible Tri-Lakes
region cooperative projects was much higher than the Palmer Divide Water Group
anticipated. Water districts and municipalities in the area want to identify
projects that would maximize reuse and water credits, as well as consolidate and
share expensive infrastructure such as storage and treatment facilities as part
of an effort to become more efficient in using area resources.

Group members had originally estimated that the study would
cost $70,000 to $75,000. BBA submitted an estimate approaching $340,000. A major
portion of that cost was attributable to the billable hours that would be
submitted by the contract engineers representing each participating district at
meetings.

Several options were discussed to reduce those expenses,
including the suggestion that each district select which meeting its own
engineer should attend and absorb those costs within its budget.

BBA agreed to re-examine and adjust cost figures and submit a
new proposal at the PDWGs Jan. 14 meeting. The directors voted to authorize
Duthie to commit up to $50,000 for Donalas share of the study.
 
Waste plant update: Equalization basin almost fully operational
 
Duthie told members that, as expected, the facility
experienced very high flows during Thanksgiving. All eight cells in the
denitrification room were working. Though mixers had not yet been installed,
incoming wastewater was diverted into one of the unused new basins to avoid
overflowing the clarifier. The time lapse in radio communications between the
clarifier and the denitrification filters may have been part of the cause of
delays which resulted in backup in the clarifier. He said that once installed,
the new hardwired fiber-optic connection would permit almost instantaneous
communication and faster reaction times in transferring wastewater between
processes.

Duthie said the waste in the basin would have to be emptied
before contractors could install the mixers, which are the last pieces of
equipment needed to complete all three basins.

Weaver Construction had hoped to finish the equalization
basins before Thanksgiving weekend, but the mixers had been delivered from
Holland without elbows necessary for operation. Duthie said the elbows had to be
fabricated, and were scheduled for delivery on Nov. 30. The basins were expected
to be fully operational by Dec. 7.
 
Regional Building delays permitting process as costs rise
 
Duthie told board members that the influent station and
preliminary treatment area would be the next stage to be constructed. He
complained that Regional Building had twice returned the plans to consulting
engineers at GMS; once because the inspector&quot;couldnt find the
restroom&quot;in the mechanical building. Duthie blamed the lack of inspector
expertise and the fact that inspectors were frequently unavailable for
consultation with the engineers for the numerous building-permit delays.

The contractor is unable to lock in prices for building
materials until the plans for the foundation and sequencing batch reactor are
approved. Meanwhile, costs continue to skyrocket. Duthie stated that the prices
of concrete and steel together had risen approximately 22 percent in the past 15
months.

Because the expansion is&quot;design and build&quot;, the
owners of the wastewater facility will not see hard prices until the design is
finished. Duthie said he hoped to have a final design by the end of December.

Duthie expressed concern that the cash-pressed Triview
Metropolitan District will not be able to absorb the additional costs, and
Colorado Water and Power may not agree to increase its loan.
 
Duthie seeks to speed contractor payment
 
Payments to the contractor have also been slower than Duthie
would like. Because the loan from Colorado Water and Power did not cover
construction costs for the equalization basins but will cover&quot;soft&quot;(design-related) costs, engineer Roger Sams of GMS has been breaking the
expenses into those categories to maximize the amounts that can be reimbursed
through the loan. This has resulted in about a months delay between the time
Weaver submits its bill and the date the treatment plant owners send in their
request for a loan reimbursement check.

Meanwhile, Weaver is paying for expensive items out of its
own funds. The mixers for the basins alone cost about $240,000.

Duthie hopes that with completion of the equalization basin,
the length of time between billing by the contractor and payment will be
shortened. He said that he wants to avoid mechanic liens, which could delay the
project and place it behind schedule.
 
Struthers extension south of Baptist under construction
 
Dirt work for the southern extension of Struthers Road is
under way. Due to restrictions related to Prebles meadow jumping mouse
habitat, construction was delayed until November. Engineers with GMS are working
with Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt to install Donalas portion of a
pipeline linking the district with Triview.
 
Well 2A redrill successful
 
Duthie said Layne-Western had performed additional
development on Well 2A, and was successful in placing the casing to the desired
depth. The walls of the well had swelled after the initial hole was drilled,
preventing the casing from being placed properly.

Pumping tests indicated a short-term yield of 600 gallons per
minute; Duthie had expected at least 400 gallons per minute.

The well should be operational in January or February.
 
Keller relinquishes deed for storage tank site
 
Donala received the deed from Keller Homes, Inc., for two
acres behind the Robert Hull treatment plant where the district would like to
place a storage tank. Struthers Ranch Development Co. had promised to give the
land to Donala as part of the inclusion agreement for the development, but had
neglected to do so before selling to homebuilders John Laing Homes and Keller.
After several months, staff was successful in acquiring the deed.

Initially, the district had planned to build a storage tank
for drinking water on the site. Duthie told the board that Donala would wait
until the scoping study for the Palmer Divide area headed up by BBA was complete
before making a decision regarding the most efficient use of the site.

Engineers from GMS will draw up preliminary plans, but remain
flexible. A tank could be used for drinking or reuse water, and the connecting
pipeline routes would depend upon intended use. Consolidation of resources in
the region could also make the tank unnecessary.

Possibility for use of Jakes Lake water discussed: Board
members discussed approaching Gleneagle Golf Club owners to negotiate the use of
Jakes Lake as a drinking water source during the months when the lake is not
being used to water the course, possibly in trade for irrigation water. More
stringent water treatment standards imposed by the state on surface sources
would have to be adequately addressed. Sources of contamination, such as
fertilizer and runoff from asphalt, can significantly affect water quality. The
expense associated with treatment could make the idea economically unfeasible.

Duthie also mentioned the possibility of enlarging a
privately owned pond off Pristine as a small reservoir site, as it is connected
to Jakes Lake. It could be expanded to about five acres. However, mouse
habitat and wetland regulations might prohibit such significant alterations.
 
2007 board meeting schedule set
 
Duthie distributed the schedule for 2007 after conferring
with members as to potential conflicts. The board will meet on the fourth
Wednesday of January (Jan. 24) and November (Nov. 28); meetings for the other 10
months will be held on the third Wednesday. All meetings will begin at 1:30 p.m.
Any further changes will be posted a minimum of 24 hours prior to the new or
cancelled meeting at one of three locations: the drop box at the Holbein office,
the drop box near Loaf N Jug or Peoples National Bank on Gleneagle
Drive.

The board went into executive session at 3:22 p.m. to discuss
the purchase, acquisition, lease or transfer of water, and personnel matters.

**********

The Donala board will hold its next regular meeting on Jan.
24 (the fourth Wednesday) at 1:30 p.m. at the Donala office, 15850 Holbein
Drive. Meetings are normally held on the third Wednesday of each month.

 
 
 Triview Metropolitan District, December 13: Triview
budget rises to $3 million for 2007
 
By Elizabeth Hacker
 
At the Triview Metropolitan Board of Directors meeting Dec.
13, the board excused President Steve Stephensons absence, and Vice President
Joe Belzer led the meeting.

District administrator Dale Hill presented the financial
summary for November and December. She reported that the district had issued two
commercial permits since the last meeting, one for a small retail business and
the other for Ent Credit Union, but that no housing permits had been pulled.
Director Julie Glenn asked if the requests for residential water taps had fallen
below the projections for 2006 and Hill responded that the housing market was
flat and that the district supplied about 75 fewer water taps than had been
projected for 2006. The board authorized funds for payment of the December
bills.

The board opened and then closed the public hearing on the
proposed 2007 budget, as there was no public comment.

District manager Larry Bishop reported that the total Triview
Metropolitan District operational 2007 budget with contingencies was
approximately $3 million, which was an increase of 11.5 percent or $317,000 over
the 2006 budget. He noted that the budget had been slightly modified to reflect
the sluggish housing market but otherwise remained consistent with what the
board had reviewed in November. He explained that of the list of itemized
anticipated 2007 projected expenditures, only funds for the water storage tank
and the wastewater treatment plant expansion were actually committed. The other
capital projects would only be considered if funds were available.

 1.5 million gallon water storage tank ($1,200,000) Water transmission line ($ 900,000) Water Treatment Plant B expansion ($1,100,000) Interconnect Baptist Road ($ 62,600) Interconnect Struthers Road ($ 166,500) Wastewater treatment facility expansion ($2,500,000) 

Total: $5,929,100

After reviewing the budget, the board had no further
questions and approved the resolution appropriating funds for the 2007 budget.

District administrator Dale Hill noted that the districts
mill levy would remain at 25 mills. She reported that to balance the 2006
budget, an additional $178,534 was needed for the general operating budget and
$650,250 was necessary to balance the budget for bond payment and interest,
thereby increasing the final assessment for the 2006 budget to $3.3 million, or
approximately a half million dollars over the approved 2006 budget. She added
that this increase was largely due to the cost of refinancing the bond debt,
which in the long run would save the district millions of dollars.

In addition to those additions to the 2006 budget, Hill
reported that an emergency fund of $100,000 was included in the amended budget
to cover any potential unforeseen problems that might occur before the end of
the year.

Bishop thanked Hill for her work on finalizing the amendments
to the 2006 budget and added that it was important to be as close to reality as
possible because any expenditure not accounted for in the budget would be
closely scrutinized by the state auditor later. The board adopted the
resolutions to amend the 2006 budget and to certify the districts mill levy.

The board then adopted a resolution to enter into an
intergovernmental agreement with the Pikes Peak Regional Water Authority (PPRWA),
committing $10,000, which was Triviews share of the cost for the PPRWA to
pursue studying the viability of surface water from Brush Hollow. The board
appointed Bishop as the primary and Hill as the back-up representative for the
PPRWA and El Paso County Water Authority boards.

In his managers report, Bishop reported that the pumping
statistics were at 82 percent, reiterating that until they were at 85 to 90
percent, he would not be satisfied. He noted they had tested the residential
meters and concluded that the loss was not at the consumption end and that the
biggest problem in determining where the loss was occurring was the lack of
meters at the wells. Because the outflows between the wells and the water
treatment plant were not being metered, there was no way to determine if there
was backwash in the system or leaks in the lines. The engineer was evaluating
the situation and would recommend well meter placement and cost at a future
meeting. Bishop added that some loss was to be expected and that pumping
efficiency of over 85 percent was considered to be in the normal range.

Bishop reported that he had met with Rick Blevins of the
Market Place at Jackson Creek and reiterated that he could not support the
request for 3.2 million gallons per year to operate Big Wave Carwash. He said
that they were discussing methods to reduce the amount of water necessary and to
determine a cost that would offset the loss of tap fees from single-family
equivalents and other businesses due to the large water allocation necessary to
operate a carwash. He noted that no specifics had been worked out but that he
would have more to report at a later meeting.
 
Baptist sewer line cost protested
 
Bishop reported that he heatedly walked out of the first
meeting regarding the cost for a sewer line along Baptist Road when they told
him that Triview would be assessed $290,000. He subsequently met with County
Commissioner Wayne Williams, County Administrator Terry Harris and County
Department of Transportation Director John McCarty, the general construction
contractor, and the developer of Sanctuary Pointe. Bishop said he was able to
negotiate the cost down to around $60,000, adding that he may be able to reduce
Triviews cost even further as negotiation continues.

Bishop reported that the rolling terrain at Sanctuary Pointe
was challenging and that they were looking for tank and well sites. He noted
that at one time the developer had proposed running sewer lines between 10 to 20
lots to Donala but said when the developer came back and proposed that 40
percent of the lots be serviced by Donala, he respectfully declined and
requested that they build a lift station to the Triview wastewater treatment
plant. He added that as yet, the developer had not signed the agreement to come
into the district.

Bishop reported that the Wastewater Treatment Facility
expansion would come in approximately $200,000 over the $8 million budgeted for
the project and that he had requested a final cost estimate from the engineer.
The money that they expected to save on the proposed lower-cost alternative
design to the concrete-lined tank did not work out so they were going with the
original design. They also looked for other cost savings such as replacing the
copper wiring with aluminum but were subsequently informed that there were more
maintenance problems with aluminum wiring, so the idea wasnt practical.

Bishop noted that the Monument Board of Trustees had
requested a joint meeting on Jan. 31 and that the boards next regular meeting
would be at 4 p.m. Jan. 24.

The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.

The Woodmoor district is currently involved in the planning
stages of the new Lewis-Palmer District 38 high school. As part of Woodmoors
conservation emphasis, D-38 officials and Woodmoor staff are engaged in talks to
provide non-potable irrigation water to the school.

During an executive session at their Dec. 14 meeting,
Woodmoor board members discussed ongoing talks to install a non-potable water
line. The directors continued to weigh options and costs at a special executive
session meeting on Dec. 27. Though the board has not yet offered a contract,
Manager Phil Steininger is confident that the two parties will reach an
agreement.

The board also reviewed and finalized the 2007 budget, which
had been discussed in detail at several meetings during October and November.
 
Integrity bank presents yearly update on investments
 
Randy Rush of Integrity Bank gave a year-end summary of the
districts investments. He reported that the current yield on investments is
5.14 percent. As specified by the board, Integrity is locking in short-term
investments for the district with three-, six-, and 12- month maturity dates.

Rush said that rates will probably decline next year. So far,
the investments managed by Integrity have been doing at least as well as those
the district has in C-Safe and Colo Trust. (Woodmoor previously had invested all
its cash assets in the two funds.)

He told members they could expect to see a greater difference
in a falling rate environment, because the district would benefit from being
able to lock in short-term investments for up to two years, whereas C-Safe and
Colo Trust return at the current rate.

He cautioned against maturity dates exceeding two years,
stating that because of the volatility of the market, he considered longer-term
investments risky.
 
Financial report shows income below expectations
 
Secretary Jim Wyss reported that income for 2006 continued to
fall below projections. The district had realized approximately 74 percent of
expected income. By the middle of December, the district should have collected
just under 92 percent to be on track. He said that sewer use fees were lower
than expected. Water use fees, which had also been low, had&quot;come back
up,&quot;and were reasonably near projections.

However, professional fees were significantly higher than
budgeted. He concluded by stating that overall, most other projections seemed to
be in line with actual figures.
 
Board approves budget
 
Steininger distributed budget packets and finalized budget
numbers with the board. He had made several revisions as actual figures became
available.

He noted that inclusion fees were substantially higher than
originally anticipated, while activations on water reservations were less than
one-third what staff expected.

Members then passed the required resolutions approving the
budget, setting the districts mill levy and appropriating funds.
 
Joint Use Committee report

Officer elections: Benny Nasser, Woodmoors delegate to
the Joint Use Committee (JUC), reported that last years officers had been
re-elected, with Lowell Morgan of the Monument Sanitation District again serving
as president, Nasser as vice president, and Todd Bell of the Palmer Lake
Sanitation District serving as secretary. The JUC consists of one representative
from each of the three districts that own the Tri-Lakes Wastewater Treatment
Facility (Monument and Palmer Lake Sanitation Districts and Woodmoor).
 
Cash Fund increase approved: In other business, all three
districts voted to add $7,000 each to the original $10,000 that each district
placed in the facilitys cash-flow escrow account. The money is used primarily
to pay bills, but may also be used for emergencies.

As executive agent, Woodmoor had previously handled
bookkeeping and on occasion paid bills from its own account when a bill due date
fell before a member boards monthly meeting, during which payments were
approved. Now that the facility is self-managing, participating agencies agreed
that the plant needed to retain sufficient funds to cover monthly bills.

The Woodmoor directors authorized board President Jim Taylor
to sign an amendment to the cash-flow escrow agreement increasing the amount
each of the three owning districts must keep in the account to $17,000.
 
Concern over copper testing: Representatives also
discussed the limitations of copper level testing. Nasser said that samples
vary, and because the copper limits specified by the state are so minuscule, the
committee felt it was important for the testing labs to specify standard
deviation when submitting test results. Facility manager Bill Burks will ask the
two labs used by the facility to include standard deviation in future test
result statements.
 
Woodmoors management of wastewater plant ends: Woodmoor
had been the executive agent for management of the Tri-Lakes Wastewater
Treatment Facility. The JUC has now assigned management duties to facility
manager Bill Burks. Nasser distributed copies of a final draft job description
for facility manager Burks position for the directors for review and comment
prior to the next JUC meeting on Jan. 9.
 
Palmer Divide Water Group wants water authority status by
January
 
Steininger told the board that the Palmer Divide Water Group
met that morning and had decided to establish the new Pikes Peak Regional Water
Authority by January 2007. Taylor asked if delegates had to be an elected member
of the board; attorney Erin Smith answered no.

The Woodmoor board then voted unanimously to approve the
intergovernmental agreement establishing the Pikes Peak Regional Water
Authority, and authorized Taylor to sign the document. In signing, the Woodmoor
Water and Sanitation District also becomes a member. Woodmoor directors had
previously attended a program along with directors and trustees from other local
districts and municipalities to hear the reasoning behind the establishment of
an authority and plans for dealing with the approaching water shortage in
northern El Paso County.

The PDWG will dissolve when the new authority officially
convenes, which will probably take place at the water groups next meeting on
Jan. 9. Board members appointed Steininger as their representative to the
authority, and Shaffer as alternate.

As a state-recognized entity, the new Pikes Peak Regional
Water Authority may enter into contracts and develop water projects to bring
surface and supplemental water into the region. Board members believe that by
consolidating effort and resources, they can accomplish collectively what
districts could not afford to do individually.

Smith reserved discussions regarding the memorandum of
understanding with Mark Morleys corporations for executive session. Morley
and his associates own Brush Hollow Reservoir and Stonewall quarry; the new
authority is interested in purchasing storage space for water it hopes to
acquire in the lower Arkansas Valley.

One of the first issues the authority will address is whether
to authorize a region-wide study headed by Charlie Stanzione of the hydrologic
consulting firm Bishop Brogden Associates (BBA).

The study would identify and examine the feasibility of
projects intended to use the areas water resources as efficiently as possible
by maximizing augmentation and reuse credits, consolidating storage and
treatment facilities, and constructing interconnecting infrastructure to link
districts in anticipation of future supplemental and surface sources. The
authority will also consider the feasibility of a satellite well field.

The favored proposal for appropriating the cost among
participating districts and municipalities is to divide the total according to
each districts buildout projections for 2020. Steininger budgeted $50,000 for
Woodmoors share. BBA will present a reworked estimate at the meeting.
 
Filter at South Water Treatment Facility not operating
 
Operations manager Randy Gillette told board members that one
of three filters at the South Filter Treatment Facility has developed a problem.
At least one of the underdrains within the filter failed, allowing filtering
media (sand, gravel, etc.) to clog 18 to 20 adjoining underdrains.

The underdrains are protected openings along a pipe that lies
in the bottom of a large filter. Raw water enters on top of the filtering media,
and the water moves vertically downward through various layers of filtering
material, penetrates the pipe through the underdrains, and is carried out of the
filter.

Gillette said district technicians were pulling the filter
apart and emptying the media, which would be put back in and the filter
reassembled after the fouled underdrains were replaced.

Gillette told the board that even with one filter down, lake
water could be properly treated for drinking using the other two.
 
Pipeline rehabilitation continues
 
Gillette reported that contractors will continue lining sewer
pipes through December and into 2007. Folded PVC is placed in the older clay
pipes, heated and inflated to provide an impermeable plastic surface that is
resistant to tree root infiltration and leakage. Lining existing pipes is
significantly faster and cheaper than excavating a decaying pipeline and
replacing it.
 
Drilling on Well 20 nearly complete
 
Steininger told members that at the time of the meeting,
contractor Henkel Drilling needed to drill about 100 more feet to the desired
depth for Well 20. BBA hydrologic engineers had decided to drill to a depth of
1,860 feet, then 50 more feet into the Laramie shale below the Arapahoe aquifer
to allow space for&quot;sluff&quot;(substrate dislodged from the well walls).

That evening, technicians were scheduled to begin well
logging, which involves lowering sonar equipment into the hole to find the
depths of the most conducive sands for the placement of the screens. Casing
construction (fabrication of the tube with alternating solid and screened
sections) and placement was set to begin about Dec. 15, with well development
(cleaning out of the&quot;mud&quot;used in drilling and readying the well for
pumping) starting on Dec. 18.

Taylor asked if the team had found water. Steininger said
yes, they had hit water, but would not know yield numbers until after the pump
tests. (See photo to the left.)
 
Meter exchange program&quot;wrapping up&quot;
 
District engineer Jessie Shaffer updated board directors on
the progress of the meter replacement program. He said that only 15 or 20
residential meters had not yet been changed out. He said that technicians were
rebuilding commercial meters; only 20 remained to be done out of a total of 80
meters.

Shaffer expected to complete work on all commercial meters by
the end of December, but cautioned that a few commercial or residential jobs
could carry over into the new year. He promised to present a rundown of the
program, including budget numbers and response rates, at the January meeting.
 
Subdivision work advances
 
As expected, contractor work has slowed during the winter
months. Shaffer ran through a status list for the board.

 Lenar, the developer of Misty Acres, which is located
 east of the RV campground and south of County Line Road, is working toward
 conditional acceptance of the water and sewer infrastructure. The as-built
 drawings have not yet been submitted to Woodmoor. Monument Business Park, located along Monument Hill Road,
 is in the design and platting phase. Mel Plowman of MGP is working with El Paso County on
 various aspects of the project. The development is located at the southeast
 corner of I-25 and County Line Road. Construction plans for the new Lewis-Palmer School
 District 38 high school are proceeding at a&quot;blistering&quot;rate.
 D-38 plans to break ground in the spring. Pulte Homes is still working on the infrastructure for
 Walters Commons Filing 1 and 2, located north of Higby. 
 
Engineering firm to evaluate Woodmoor dam safety
 
The Lake Woodmoor dam is a 1960-70s-era earthen dam
classified as Class I because failure could result in loss of life. As a Class
I, it is subject to yearly inspections by the state dam engineer.

A slide gate at the base of the dam allows water to drain
from the reservoir, and several underdrains penetrate the interior to channel
leakage. Silt and sand has collected in some of the pipes. A district crew tried
to use a television camera to examine the interior of the pipes, but the
diameter of the underdrains are too tight to permit passage of the camera. The
inspector expressed his opinion that the dams safety should be evaluated.

Steininger has allocated $100,000 in 2007 for a full
inspection of the dams mechanical parts and drain system. He would like to
hire engineering firm URS, which specializes in dams, to conduct the evaluation.

Steininger is also considering digging out the north end of
the lake to increase depth.
 
District will hold public meeting on conservation programs
 
Steininger told the board that he would like to host a
community meeting for Woodmoor residents in late winter to educate the public
about ongoing conservation programs in the region and the district, and to talk
about long-range plans to provide supplemental and surface water to the area.

Among the subjects he would like to see addressed:

 Woodmoors new rate structure: how it will affect
 residents and why it was instituted. The demand management program: feedback and other ideas
 to encourage conservation. Projects in Woodmoors long-range plan and how they
 will affect residents. 

Steininger asked board members to help put together a
community meeting outline for the January meeting. The directors liked the idea
and suggested that the district use the middle school to avoid the appearance of
collaboration with any other community group.

The public portion of the meeting adjourned at 3:02 p.m. and
the board went into executive session to discuss the purchase, acquisition, or
sale of water rights; to consult with their attorney on specific legal questions
related to negotiating positions; and to discuss personnel matters.

The next regular meeting of the Woodmoor board will take
place on Jan. 11 at 1 p.m. at the Woodmoor office, 1845 Woodmoor Drive.

 
 
 Donald Wescott Fire Protection
District, December 6: 2006 budget amendment and 2007 budget approved
 
By Jim Kendrick
 
The Donald Wescott Fire Protection District (DWFPD) board
approved the mill levy certification, budget, and appropriations for 2007 on Dec
6. Unlike the Tri-Lakes Fire Protection District (TLFPD) and Woodmoor/Monument
Fire Protection District (W/MFPD), Wescott will continue to finance its
operations with only 7 mills and has no plans to increase its property tax rate.
Wescott had an operating surplus of $8,070 in 2006. All board members were
present.
 
2007 volunteer pension budget approved
 
The DWFPD Pension Board met before the district board. The
pension board unanimously approved its annual contribution to Wescotts
volunteer pension fund from $50,000 to $75,000 in 2007 to take advantage of
short-term matching funds of 90 percent from the state. Pensions are
administered by the Fire and Police Protective Association. The board agreed
that increasing the contribution for three years would guarantee program
viability and allow lower funding levels after 2009. The pension board also
unanimously adopted the 2007 pension fund budget.
 
2006 DWFPD budget amendment approved
 
The DWFPD board unanimously approved an amendment to the 2006
budget that increased the districts estimated revenue of $1,297,573 to match
actual revenue of $1,395,070 reflecting increases in:

 State motor vehicle special ownership taxes from $60,000
 to $140,000 Interest income from $3,000 to $20,000 Grant income from $60,000 to $60,497 
The 2006 amendment also changed some 2006 expenditure totals:
 Disability insurance decreased from $4,500 to $3,000 Fire prevention supplies and expenses increased from $400
 to $1,000 Medical equipment increased from $12,000 to $18,000 Total 2006 expenditures increased from $1,371,900 to
 $1,387,000. 

The starting fund balance for 2006 increased from $350,650 to
$450,443. The ending fund balance for 2006 increased from 276,323 to $458,513.
 
2007 budget approved
 
The board unanimously approved the 2007 mill levy
certification for 7.0 mills. The certification was forwarded to El Paso County
by the Dec. 15 deadline.

The board unanimously approved the 2007 budget. Total revenue
is $1,381,502. Total expenditures are $1,368,100. The fund balance is projected
to increase by the end of 2007 to $471,915.

**********

The next board meeting will be held at 7 p.m. on Jan. 17 at
Wescott Station 1, 15415 Gleneagle Drive. Regular board meetings are normally
held on the third Wednesday of the month.

 
 
 Donald Wescott Fire Protection
District, December 27: District helps motorists stranded by blizzard
 
By Jim Kendrick
 
The Donald Wescott Fire Protection District (DWFPD) Board of
Directors held their regular monthly meeting on Dec. 27, due to postponements
caused by snow. Directors Joe Potter and Kraig Sullivan were excused.

Treasurer Dave Cross and Recording Secretary Ginnette Ritz
reported that all the districts radios were being upgraded to add channels
for the new APCO 25 standard to improve communications between all types of
emergency service providers. The money will come from the 2006 budget, which
will be adjusted to reflect that. Approximately $80,000 worth of new capital
equipment has been ordered.

Chief Jeff Edwards reported there was a total of 81 calls in
November, 58 in the district and 23 automatic aid or mutual aid calls. Total
runs for the year are at 1,019 which is a decrease of 26 percent from last year.
The department responded on 69 rescues during the last storm. Wescott responded
to a call that the Colorado Springs Police Department had received regarding
over 40 cars stranded on Voyager Parkway. There were 17 people on shift during
the storm4 full-time employees and 13 volunteers. The districts Hummer and
brush trucks were the main vehicles used for rescues. The engine or tender were
used only for fire calls.

Edwards reviewed the lengthy list of projects that were
completed during 2006:

 New beds, lockers, and bunker gear racks being purchased
 and installed Clean-up and completion of all projects for construction
 of the new Station 1 engine bay New training equipment was purchased for numerous
 training classes Department is now registered with the state for wildland
 deployments New VHF repeater has been installed New fire truck has been ordered Purchased an air bottle filling trailer and ATV Participation in the Cub Scout Jamboree, Coats for
 Colorado, Halloween&amp;Santa Patrol, the PGA golf tournament, raised
 $11,000 for MDA, worked closely with area schools, and has taught numerous
 CPR classes. Donated a fire truck to the Henry Fire Department in
 Louisiana. Received grants for $9,500 for wildland gear and a new
 life pack, and are still waiting on a grant toward a thermal imaging camera. No fire ground, EMS, or workers compensation related
 injuries this year 

The board once again set meeting dates for 2007 as the third
Wednesday of each month at 7 p.m..

Chief Edwards advised that the districts new attorney, Tim
Schutz, will be attending the January meeting, the auditor should have estimates
for 2006, and he would present an update on the staff performance appraisals for
2007.

The meeting was adjourned at 7:45 p.m.

 Tri-Lakes Monument Fire Rescue Authority,
December 13: Authority board approves $3.9 million budget despite opposition
from WMFPD treasurer; moves toward merger
 
By John Heiser
 
The Dec. 13 meetings of the boards of the Tri-Lakes Fire
Protection District and the Woodmoor-Monument Fire Protection District occurred
during a recess part-way through the joint meeting of the boards as the board of
the Tri-Lakes-Monument Fire Rescue Authority. This was done so the boards could
receive a joint briefing on the 2007 budget and then vote on that budget in
their separate meetings.

After reclassifying several items as operational rather then
capital improvement expenses, the budget was approved by both boards and the
combined board. Bob Hansen, treasurer of the Woodmoor-Monument district, voted
against the 2007 budget because the projected operational expenses were greater
than the anticipated income, that is, the budget was not balanced and would
require expenditure from the Woodmoor-Monument districts approximately
$800,000 in reserve funds to cover the shortfall of $13,080.

Both boards passed motions to start a merger of the two
districts along the lines suggested by firefighters at the November meeting. The
proposal was for dissolution of the Woodmoor-Monument district and inclusion of
those residents into the Tri-Lakes district. A committee of representatives from
the two boards was formed to negotiate a pre-inclusion agreement. Topics to be
addressed by the committee are expected to include composition of the Board of
Directors of the expanded Tri-Lakes district and disposition of the reserve
funds of the Woodmoor-Monument district.

All directors of both boards were present except Keith Duncan
of the Tri-Lakes district board.
 
Financial report
 
Fire Authority Treasurer John Hildebrandt said the authority
had received 99.7 percent of expected property tax revenue anticipated for the
year.

As of Nov. 30, ambulance revenues were $386,576, 110 percent
of the $350,000 projected for the year. Hildebrandt added that as of the Dec. 13
meeting, ambulance revenues stood at about $415,000.

Specific ownership taxes of $287,104 lagged at 83.8 percent
of the budgeted amount for the year. At the end of November, revenue and
expenditures would be expected to have reached 91.7 percent (eleven-twelfths) of
the yearly amounts.

As of Nov. 30, total revenue stood at $3.2 million or 99.0
percent of the anticipated total for the year.

The expenses for the Tri-Lakes district were 6.4 percent over
budget. The expenses for the Woodmoor-Monument district were 8.9 percent under
budget. Overall expenses stood at $2.98 million, 92.2 percent of the budgeted
total for the year, 0.54 percent ($175,396) greater than the anticipated amount
at the end of November.

Hildebrandt noted that a large part of the Tri-Lakes districts
excess expenses could be attributed to the unanticipated $89,573 spent on repair
and maintenance of Tri-Lakes Station 2 on Roller Coaster Road near Highway 105.
That station started operation November 2004. Hildebrandt also noted that the
district anticipates receiving $60,000 in grant money associated with the
purchase of an ambulance and added that the districts have adequate reserves or
an adequate bank line of credit to cover expenses through the early part of 2007
until they begin to receive property tax revenues in February and March.
 
2007 meeting schedule set
 
The board unanimously approved holding fire authority
meetings on the fourth Wednesday of each month with the exception of the
December meeting, which will be held on Dec. 12, one week early to permit
approval of the 2008 budget prior to the Dec. 15 deadline.
 
2007 budget approved
 
Battalion Chief Bryan Jack presented the revised 2007 budget.
He noted that the staff has been working on the budget since July. Some
highlights:

 Total revenues are projected at $3.94 million, up from
 $3.23 million in the 2006 budget. Of the $709,533 increase, $375,249 is from
 increased property taxes, most of which is the result of the voter-approved
 increase in the Tri-Lakes districts mill levy from 7 mills to 8.5 mills.
 The Woodmoor-Monument districts property tax rate remains 9.921 mills. An
 additional $126,000 in revenue is projected to come from the Tri-Lakes
 districts recently imposed impact fee on new developments. The fee is
 $700 per new house and $700 per 2,000 square feet of new commercial space. The Woodmoor-Monument district is projected to spend from
 its reserve funds $334,211 to purchase a new fire truck, $16,300 for other
 fire equipment, and $26,207 for capital improvements to its fire station,
 communication equipment, and computers and software. During 2007, the Tri-Lakes district is projected to
 realize a net surplus (revenue minus expenses) of $230,865. Hildebrandt
 noted that if this projection holds true it would be the first time in 10
 years that the district will end the year with a surplus. Among expenses, total salary costs are projected to
 increase 6 percent to $1.99 million; insurance costs are projected to
 increase 16 percent to $338,922 per year; vehicle fuel, repair and
 maintenance costs are projected to increase 28 percent to $87,200; and
 training costs are projected to increase 18 percent to $64,400. Regarding the revised pay and allowance schedule on which
 the budget was based, Jack said salaries are still low compared to other
 districts but that the total compensation package is better than most. Jody
 Thorpe, speaking on behalf of the Monument Firefighters IAFF union Local
 4319, said,&quot;It is a step in the right direction. It is still low but
 with the merger, and especially the impact fee, we can get closer.&quot; 

Hansen said that to balance the operational budget, some
items had been improperly moved from the operational budget to the capital
expenditure budget. He said,&quot;I reject that.&quot;He said the budget
should have been balanced by reviewing needs vs. wants. He also objected to
e-mails from other fire authority board members directing that the changes be
made to the budget. He left the meeting in protest and did not return until the
fire authority board reconvened following the separate district meetings.

Hildebrandt replied,&quot;We tried our darnedest to make the
operational side balance.&quot;

Woodmoor-Monument district Director Tim Miller said,&quot;The property tax revenue to the Woodmoor-Monument district increases very
little year to year.&quot;He added that the Denver-Boulder consumer price index
is increasing about 3.5 percent per year but the districts revenue is
increasing only about 2 percent per year. He said the district is reaching a
point where to balance the budget it must dip into its reserves or go to the
voters for approval of a mill levy increase.

The board unanimously adopted the revised pay and allowance
schedule and then took a recess to allow the individual districts to discuss the
2007 budget.
 
Reconvene
 
When the fire authority board reconvened, it unanimously
approved a revised 2006 budget with the items adjusted to reflect the actual
expenditures for the year. It also unanimously approved appropriation of the
funds in accordance with the revised 2006 budget.

The board then approved a revised 2007 budget with items
totaling $13,080 moved from the capital expenditure budget to the operational
budget. The vote was 8-1 with Hansen opposed. Appropriation of the funds in
accordance with the revised 2007 budget was also approved 8-1 with Hansen voting
no.
 
Merger steps
 
Woodmoor-Monument district President Si Sibell reported that
the Woodmoor-Monument board approved a motion to proceed with dissolving the
district and seeking inclusion in the Tri-Lakes district.

Tri-Lakes district President Charlie Pocock reported that the
Tri-Lakes board approved a motion supporting inclusion of the residents of the
Woodmoor-Monument district into the Tri-Lakes district.

Each of the boards agreed to appoint two board members to a
committee to develop a pre-inclusion agreement defining the terms and conditions
of the merger.

The authority board then went into executive session to
discuss personnel issues.

 Tri-Lakes Fire Protection District,
December 13: District ends year 7% over budget
 
By Lee Colburn
 
President Charlie Pocock opened the Dec. 13 Fire Protection
Board (TLFPD) meeting, with Keith Duncan as the only absent member. Battalion
Chief Bryan Jack was also in attendance. This meeting was held during a recess
of the Tri-Lakes Monument Fire Rescue Authority meeting.

The board reviewed the financial report and the 7 percent
overage in the 2006 budget, which came mainly from expenses for Station 2
groundwater saturation and new ambulance expenditures, and outstanding grant
reimbursements. However, the district has assets in the bank to cover
end-of-year expenses and two lines of credit to cover the first part of 2007
outlays. The board approved the amended 2006 budget and also approved a
state-mandated resolution to highlight the unanticipated changes to the budget
authority for 2006.

The board also approved a 2007 appropriation resolution of
approximately $2.3 million for the TLFPD spending authority and a budget
resolution for 2007 calendar year. Treasurer John Hildebrandt noted that 2007
budget process was&quot;superb,&quot;with all the departments coming together
to produce a well-balanced proposal. Hildebrandt also responded to questions
about the budgets personnel pay estimations and explained the budgets
revenue estimation process. Overall, Hildebrandt projected that the department
will be in the black, the first positive initial projection in 10 years. The
board unanimously approved the 2007 budget proposal.

The board also approved a 2007 appropriation resolution of
approximately $2.3 million for the TLFPD spending authority and a budget
resolution for the 2007 calendar year.
 
Merger of two districts proposed
 
Looking to the future, the board approved a three-part motion
to form a working group for a proposed merger of the two Tri-Lakes and Woodmoor/Monument
fire protection districts into one district. The purpose is to improve overall
management and operational efficiencies by decreasing to one combined board.

To prepare the merger proposal, a joint working group from
both districts will craft a merger agreement providing for one district for the
entire Tri-Lakes Woodmoor fire coverage area. The board unanimously approved the
motion.

The meeting adjourned at 8:30 p.m. and the board members
rejoined the Fire Authority board meeting.

 
 
 Woodmoor/Monument Fire Protection District,
December 13: Board votes to pursue inclusion into the Tri-Lakes district
 
By John Heiser

At the Dec. 13 meeting of the Woodmoor-Monument Fire
Protection District board, after approving the 2007 budget, the directors
unanimously voted to commence dissolution of the Woodmoor-Monument district and
inclusion into the Tri-Lakes Fire Protection District.
 
2007 budget controversy
 
Treasurer Bob Hansen stated that the district is facing a
1.78 percent increase in revenue but a 4.66 percent increase in expenses. He
added that part of the increase in expenses has resulted from an 8.72 percent
increase in salaries. Noting that the reserve funds have been set aside to cover
capital expenditures, he objected to the transfer of items from the operational
side to the capital expenditure side to balance the 2007 budget.

Director Tim Miller made a motion to move items totaling
$13,080 for fire station administration, personnel training, and medical
equipment from the capital expenditure budget to the operational budget. The
motion was approved 4-1 with Hansen abstaining.

Miller noted that with the change, expenditures would exceed
revenues by $13,080.

Hansen said,&quot;This unbalanced budget goes against
everything I believe in.&quot;

Miller said,&quot;Revenue increases are not keeping pace
with inflation. The day is fast approaching when to maintain the level of
service, we must go to the reserves or ask the voters to increase the mill
levy.&quot;

Hansen added,&quot;Or do the merger.&quot;

On a motion to approve the revised 2007 budget, the board
voted 4-1 with Hansen voting no.

Director Bill Ingram said,&quot;Starting Jan. 1, we need to
look at what we can do to bring the budget into balance.&quot;

Motions to appropriate the funds and approve the budget
message summary were approved 4-1 with Hansen voting no.

A motion to certify the property tax mill levy at 9.921 mills
was unanimously approved.
 
Board votes to pursue inclusion
 
Director Rod Wilson said that inclusion into the Tri-Lakes
district would mean a reduction in property taxes for Woodmoor-Monument
residents from 9.921 mills to 8.5 mills. He said,&quot;It is a 14 percent
savings with no decrease in services.&quot;

In response to a question from Miller regarding the merger
timeline, Battalion Chief Bryan Jack said the Woodmoor-Monument district would
appoint one or two members to meet with representatives of the Tri-Lakes board
to work out the details. Once agreement is reached, the matter would be
presented to a district court judge, who would hold a hearing within 45 days.
After the hearing, if the judge is satisfied that the matter should be presented
to the voters of the Woodmoor-Monument district, an election would be scheduled
within 50 days.

Hansen asked,&quot;What if the voters turn it down? Where
are we?&quot;

Jack replied,&quot;You still have the district and the fire
authority.&quot;

Hansen said,&quot;I have always been for this.&quot;

The board unanimously voted to seek dissolution of the
district and inclusion into the Tri-Lakes Fire Protection District.

The meeting then adjourned and the Tri-Lakes Monument Fire
Rescue Authority board meeting reconvened.

 
 
 Baptist Road Rural Transportation
Authority, December 8: Triview sewer line construction delays Baptist Road
improvements
 
By Jim Kendrick
 
The Baptist Road Rural Transportation Authority (BRRTA)
discussed construction delays caused by installation of a sewer collection line
required for Promontory Pointe and Sanctuary Pointe at its meeting on Dec. 8.
The board also approved an audit for 2005 and scheduled selection of a
construction contract manager for the I-25 Baptist Road interchange.
Commissioner Dennis Hisey was absent.

Project Manager Andre Brackin of the El Paso County
Department of Transportation gave a comprehensive engineering report on the
Baptist Road, Struthers Road, and Baptist Road interchange construction
contracts. He also discussed future projects to be performed on Baptist Road
west of I-25 using BRRTA and Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority (PPRTA)
funding.

Relocation of utilities for the Baptist Road and New
Struthers Road projects&quot;continues to be a real challenge&quot;for the
single contractor, Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt, Inc. (RMMA). Only half
the utilities have been moved so far.
 
Triview delays force workarounds
 
Brackin provided diagrams of the Triview Metropolitan
District sewer main lines that will be installed within Baptist Road for John
Laings Promontory Pointe development and Classic Homes Sanctuary Pointe
development. He said that the county has always known these Triview sewer lines
would be an issue due to the timing of the development projects.

RMMA initially estimated that delays caused by Triview not
being prepared to install the sewer lines on time will cost $232,000. All
sub-grade paving materials have been delivered to the site for final grading of
the westbound lanes. Reopening of the Kingswood Drive and Leather Chaps Drive
intersections has also been delayed. RMMA cannot do the final grading as planned
because Pate Construction Contractors, Inc., had not yet begun to dig the sewer
line trench, which is up to 19 feet deep. This scale of excavation will require
major OSHA safety precautions in the center of the westbound lanes, precluding
final grading work.

Brackin asked the BRRTA board to work with Triview and its
contractors to expedite the excavation and prevent a loss of PPRTA funding due
to major construction schedule delays. Brackin also asked the board to help work
out the major discrepancies between the initial and final sewer line drawings
submitted to the county and who would pay for the required changes. He said the
required Triview construction should be completed within four weeks.

Pate Construction will negotiate a contract to perform
Triviews trench work as a subcontractor to RMMA and will do so under RMMAs
existing construction permits, rather than Pate having to wait for the same
permits it would need to do the work independently. (See Triview article on
page 20 for other details.)
 
Brackin showed photos of the two sets of side-by-side
5-by-6-foot box culverts for stormwater drainage under the Baptist Road and
Gleneagle Drive intersection. The culverts have been completely installed under
the two westbound lanes of Baptist Road. The continuation of the two drainage
culverts under the eastbound lanes will begin in the spring when the Gleneagle
intersection will be closed.

He also said that acquisition of the new Struthers Road
right-of-way within Chaparral Hills had not been completed. Acquisition of
right-of-way for the interchange will be the most significant problem affecting
the award of a construction contract, as CDOT will not approve the bidding until
all right-of-way purchases are completed.

Brackin said environmental issues&quot;have been taken care
of&quot;by the county providing substitute Prebles mouse habitat it owns as
mitigation of state protected mouse habitat within the interchange property that
will be destroyed by the expansion.

Brackin said that every type of utility is installed under
the countys existing Baptist Road bridge over Jackson Creek, between the
interchange and Jackson Creek Parkway, due to all the utility companies avoiding
the protected mouse habitat in the states interchange. Three large box
culverts must be installed at the bridge location for stormwater control. All
the utilities in this location must be moved from their current location under
the bridge. The only alternative location is within state mouse habitat, which
will require U.S. Fish and Wildlife and Army Corps of Engineers environmental
and floodplain permits.

Coordination of these utility relocations will be performed
by the contractor selected to perform interchange contract management.
Typically, CDOT does not allow construction contract bidding to begin until all
utility clearance letters have been provided by the affected companies and all
environmental permits are in place.

his problem prevented the Monument Marketplace developer from
temporarily widening this bridge and installing a 60-inch culvert to minimize
flooding. These temporary upgrades to Baptist Road had originally been a
condition for Home Depot to obtain a certificate of occupancy in July 2004.
Neither Home Depot nor any other Marketplace store was ever held to this
condition by Triview Metropolitan District or the town. Traffic congestion and
delays at the interchange have steadily worsened since then.

This I-25 interchange approach work that would have been
performed by RMMA under the BRRTA contract will now be done under the future
interchange expansion contract, shifting about $200,000 of work.

Brackin reported that the countys evaluation panel had
selected the firm that had&quot;submitted the best proposal at a reasonable
price value for the countys needs&quot;to manage the interchange
construction contract for BRRTA and was ready to begin contract negotiations.

Brackin noted that PPRTA would provide $3,348,800 in the 2011
budget for the planned four-lane Baptist Road bridge over the Denver-Rio Grande
railroad tracks and Monument Creek. However, engineering design consultant
PBS&amp;J has estimated the cost for the bridge is about $13 million, not
counting already known mouse habitat and wetlands impacts.

The 2007 PPRTA budget includes $966,000 for roadway capacity
and widening of Baptist Road west of I-25. There will be mouse habitat and
wetlands impacts for this widening project as well. Brackin recommended
development of a work statement for engineering and utility relocation by
PBS&amp;J.

Monument Mayor Byron Glenn suggested that the town will ask
Team O2 Investments to pay for the widening as a condition of approval for the
Outrageous Oasis water park development in return for the town granting it a
10-year sales tax rebate incentive. This would allow the PPRTA funds to be
reallocated to other projects. County Commissioner Wayne Williams supported the
proposal and suggested that Glenn write a letter suggesting the reallocation to
county DOT Director John McCarty.

Dan Hunt, CDOTs project manager for coordinating the
interchange expansion with BRRTA and the county, said CDOT would waive its
customary requirement for completion of all utility relocation planning prior to
award of the construction contract. This concession will prevent many months of
delays and millions of dollars of unnecessary duplicated Baptist Road temporary
construction between the interchange and Jackson Creek Parkway.

Michael Scott of John Laing Homes said his company had been
asked by Triview Metropolitan District to facilitate installation of Triviews
sanitary sewer line under Baptist Road. John Laing will pay all costs for the
installation of both phases of the collection line.

Scott added that negotiations among the county, John Laing,
Triview, and Classic Homes had reduced the projected price of the sewer line
phases and estimated RMMA impact costs from a total of $550,000 to about
$400,000. Scott said his firm would enter into a cost recovery agreement with
Triview to receive payment from Classic Homes for its share of costs when it
begins construction of Sanctuary Pointe.

Jerry Novak of Classic Homes said that during these
negotiations, RMMA had been offered a management fee for supervising Pate
personnel. In return, RMMA has agreed to implement different work schedule
changes than originally proposed. These RMMA changes cut in half its estimated
Triview impact costs of $232,000. Novak said he believed that further cuts in
the estimated costs for traffic control during sewer line construction may also
be possible. Novak did not say how payment of the additional costs would be
divided among Triview, John Laing, and Classic.

Novak also noted that Classic had not participated in the
sewer line design because it would not need to use it for another four to five
years and that the Sanctuary Pointe parcel had just been annexed by Monument a
few weeks earlier.

Monument Director of Development Services Tom Kassawara said
he had coordinated with county project engineer Kim Reliford on the preliminary
site plan for the Monument Ridge development at the southeast corner of Jackson
Creek Parkway and Baptist Road. He said that the countys emergency services
personnel had rejected the name Olde Post Road for the main collector road
through Promontory Pointe. It will be called Gleneagle Drive.

Hunt asked the board for confirmation on how PBS&amp;J would
be paid $200,000 from BRRTA bond proceeds for performing post-design services
for CDOT. BRRTA is paying all construction and design costs. Steve Sandvik of
PBS&amp;J said CDOT would approve the bills and pass them to the county
Transportation Department, which would in turn submit them to BRRTA. Once
approved, BRRTA would pay PBS&amp;J from the $200,000 set aside in the CDOT
post-design services account.

Hunt added that the state had approved the previously
controversial state stormwater discharge and floodplain permits.

BRRTA attorney Jim Hunsaker said the countys evaluation
panel for the construction management contract had met and ranked the five
submitted bids. Brenda Gordon of El Paso County procurement said the panel would
next negotiate a contract proposal from the selected contractor and bring it
back to BRRTA for final approval and award. The board scheduled a contract
committee meeting to review the proposal at 8 a.m. on Dec. 21 and unanimously
approved a motion directing Gordon to begin contract negotiations.

The bond resolution will be approved by BRRTA at its meeting
on Feb. 9. The bonds will be marketed Feb. 12-22. The board should have a firm
interchange construction bid price before that date to be sure of the required
size of the bond issueup to $21.5 millionprior to setting the price of
the bonds. The board will authorize the bond sale before March 6, the bond
closing date. Hunsaker noted that the sales tax will not go into effect until
July 1.
 
Audit approved
 
CPA Dawn Schilling presented the draft 2005 BRRTA audit. She
noted that it was an unqualified or&quot;clean&quot;audit. BRRTAs
accounting firm, BKD, did not sign Schillings management representation
letter. Shilling said it was not unusual for third party entities to not want to
be responsible for audit results. The 2005 audit was unanimously approved.
Commissioner Williams and BRRTA Manager Denise Denslow signed the letter for
BRRTA.
 
Revised 2007 budget approved
 
BRRTA Manager Denise Denslow noted that the board had held a
public hearing and unanimously approved final drafts of the 2007 budget and
appropriation documents with the condition that changes be made to reflect the
fact that the proposed bond issuance would not occur in 2006. The final budget
and appropriation documents were unanimously approved.

The board also unanimously approved payment of 12 claims
totaling $46,982.

The board recessed the meeting at 3:50 p.m. until 8 a.m. on
Dec. 21.

The Dec. 21 meeting was continued until Dec. 22 due to a
blizzard. The BRRTA contract evaluation panel recommended a negotiated
construction management contract for $1,692,703 with Carter&amp;Burgess, Inc.
The contract was approved and awarded to Carter&amp;Burgess by contract
selection subcommittee members Williams and Glenn.

**********

The next BRRTA meeting will be held at 2:30 p.m. Feb. 9 at
Monument Town Hall, 166 Second St. Information: 481-2954.

 
 
Correction
 
In the Dec. 2 issue of OCN , it was reported that the
MGP subdivision preliminary plan was approved at the El Paso County Planning
Commission meeting Nov. 21. In fact, the plan was denied by the Planning
Commission because of drainage issues and, in particular, the question of who
would be responsible for the detention pond. The applicant wanted the county to
be responsible and the El Paso County Department of Transportation disagreed.
When the Board of County Commissioners subsequently considered the proposal, the
applicant agreed to take responsibility for the pond and the project was
approved. OCN regrets the error.

 
 
 Woodmoor Improvement Association, December
13: Emergency access to Doewood gate provided

By Chris Pollard
 
The first major item on the agenda was to resolve the final
issue of the gate on Doewood Drive. Originally put in to block off a
construction road, a review of fire evacuation procedures by local fire marshals
deemed that it should be open to allow evacuation. A memorandum of understanding
had been signed between the El Paso County Sheriffs Office and the WIA
providing that Woodmoor Public Safety now carried keys to the gate. Brian
Osterholt, director of Public Safety, said the gate could be opened only under
authority of the sheriff or the county fire marshal.
 
Traffic surveys
 
As part of the process of installing new stop signs in South
Woodmoor at Bowstring Road, Caribou Drive West and Fairplay Drive, El Paso
County had requested that follow-up traffic surveys be run to check their
effectiveness. Terry Holmes, secretary of the WIA, distributed an analysis of
the results from data taken by the WIA SMART trailer. In all three locations,
there was a significant reduction in both the volume (cars per minute) and
speeding. In addition to fewer people going over the limit, the highest speed
recorded was 15 mph less. This was despite additional construction in the
Monument Marketplace.
 
Annual General Meeting
 
Residents of Woodmoor are reminded that the Woodmoor
Improvement Associations Annual General Meeting will be held on Monday, Jan.
29 at 7 p.m. in the Lewis-Palmer Middle School cafeteria.

Its been an interesting beginning to winter and end to
2006 around the region, with two major snowstorms within the span of a week.
These storms brought the usual dichotomy to the area, with travel headaches and
life-threatening conditions juxtaposed against awe-inspiring beauty and the
power of Mother Nature.

December started off on the cold and snowy side with just
over 8 inches accumulating on the 2nd. This was accompanied by some seriously
cold air, as lows dipped well below zero late on the 2nd through the 3rd as our
first arctic air outbreak of the season moved in. This was short-lived however,
as skies cleared through the 6th, and temperatures slowly warmed back to above
normal, reaching into the upper 40s on the 5th. Another weak cold front on
the 6th brought some low clouds and fog, then warmth quickly returned by the 8th
and 9th, with highs hitting the 50 mark. Cooler conditions returned by the
next day and some light snow greeted us on the morning of the 11th. Overall,
conditions during the first three weeks of the months were quiet and mild. This
was about to take a big turn however, just in time for the holidays.

Well, a white Christmas was an understatement this year, as a
major blizzard slammed the Tri-Lakes area, along with most of the Front Range
and Eastern Plains, from the 20th to the 21st. The first signs of a pattern
change began to take shape during the early morning hours of the 17th, as the
first in a series of cold fronts pushed into the region. These initial surges of
cold air were not accompanied by any lift or moisture, so no more than flurries
and fog formed over the next couple of days. Temperatures did remain on the cool
side however, with highs holding in the 20s and low 30s for the next few
days.

During this time, our first big weather-maker gathered
strength and turned through the desert Southwest. As this ball of energy
approached the Front Range, a new area of low pressure rapidly developed in
southeastern Colorado. The counterclockwise flow around this low drew moisture
into the system and pushed it upslope against the Rockies and Palmer Divide
Several other factors came into play that allowed this storm to become so strong
and damaging. One major factor was that it slowed down and stayed nearly
stationary for more than 24 hours. Also, the pressure gradient between the
center of low pressure and the area of high pressure building in behind the
storm was steep and this allowed winds to really howl for an extended period.

So what did all that add up to? Blizzard conditions for more
than 24 hours, snowfall totals of 24-40 inches, cancellations and closure
throughout the region, and yes a beautiful winter landscape just in time for
Christmas.

But Mother Nature wasnt done with the Christmas giving
just yet, as the second major storm quickly followed on its heels. This one
followed a similar life cycle; however its positioning in relation to the
Tri-Lakes area was not as conducive for heavy snow as in the previous storm.
Because of this, we&quot;only&quot;received 15-20 inches of fresh snow, while
the southeastern plains, southern I-25 corridor, and southern foothills received
3-4 feet! Nonetheless, this was quite a storm and when added to all the snow and
headaches produced just a week prior made for some spectacular scenery around
the region.

Its been quite an eventful second half of the year, with
near record amounts of rain and snow since back in June. Itll be interesting
to see what&quot;fun&quot;Mother Nature has in store for us as we head into
2007. Look for the 2006 weather&quot;Year in Review&quot;in the next issue of
the OCN.
 
A look ahead
 
January sees the coldest temperatures of the year, but
precipitation is on the low side, with average amounts of less than an inch. The
month generally sees numerous sunny and windy days, with quick shots of snow in
between. The last few Januarys have generally been warmer than normal, with near
normal precipitation and snowfall, and after the December we just had, many
residents are probably hoping for a return to quiet weather The official monthly
forecast for January 2006, produced by the Climate Prediction Center ( http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/30day/ ),
is calling for better than average chances of slightly above normal temperatures
and precipitation. For a complete look at monthly climate summaries for the

 Letters to Our Community 
 
 An open letter to D-38 Board President Jes
Raintree
 
Regarding the employment termination of Superintendent Dr.
Michael Pomarico, it is clear from the accounts in the local press that he did
not actually resign. Rather, his employment contract with D-38 was terminated
for the convenience of the district. That is clear because D-38 bought out the
remainder of his first contract year and then paid him another years salary
equivalent, as severance.

When an employed person simply resigns, he/she is not
customarily entitled to any further compensation. When a persons employment
is terminated for cause, or for any other default of their contract, they are
customarily not paid any further compensation.

D-38 taxpayers, without any explanation from you or the
board, now have to bear the $244,000 cost of this employment termination for the
convenience of the districtan amount equal to 1.5 years additional salary.
And that compensation, after he performed as superintendent for less than six
months!

How can you and the board justify this unreasonable
expenditure of tax dollars? Why are you telling the press that the
superintendent resigned, while your actions clearly demonstrate that D-38
terminated his employment for the convenience of the board?

D-38 voters deserve better governance than you and the board
are demonstrating in this matter, and we also deserve a full explanation for
your actions. When will this be forthcoming?

Even with the loss of two days of bell ringing as a result of
the December blizzard, Monument Hill Sertoma and Lewis-Palmer Serteens collected
$35,553 during the 2006 Salvation Army Red Kettle Campaign, exceeding the 2005
Red Kettle Campaign by $3,071.

Of the Salvation Army Red Kettle total collections in El Paso
County, approximately 10 percent comes from contributions placed in the kettles
located in the Tri-Lakes community. All of the donations to the red kettles are
used to help those in need in El Paso County.

Salvation Army, Monument Hill Sertoma, and Lewis-Palmer
Serteens thank all of you who so generously donated money as you passed the bell
ringers at the red kettles located at Safeway, King Soopers, and Wal-Mart.

 A Perspective on Our Community: A Life Saved!

Ron and Kathy Lance invited two couples for an early dinner
on Aug. 7 in their Woodmoor home. Their guests were close friends with whom they
had enjoyed many shared memories: Jim and Jenanne Jenkins, from Kansas City 
prior residents of Colorado Springs, and my wife Karen and I longtime
residents of Monument and the Gleneagle areas. Jim and Jeneanne brought their
9-year-old granddaughter and her best friend to dinner with them.

The two girls finished eating early and asked Ron if they
could watch a movie while the adults finished eating. Ron agreed and led the
girls downstairs. In about three minutes the girls came running upstairs and
called out,&quot;The man fell down! The man fell down!&quot;

Jim and I went downstairs to check on Ron. We found him lying
on the floor his eyelids open but his pupils rolled upward. We aligned Rons
torso and legs, and checked for a pulse and any sign of breathing. Neither was
evident.

The wives asked if everything was okay. Jim replied&quot;No,
Karen please call 911 and request help.&quot;He looked at me and said,&quot;Lets start CPR, Glenn. Ill hold Rons head to keep his throat open
and clear.&quot;I started CPR practiced in a class some 25 years earlier as
part of my training as an Air Force pilot. Jim continued to monitor Ron for a
pulse and any sign of breathing.

Karen briefed 911 on the incident and relayed questions she
could not answer to Jim. I continued to administer CPR and Jim maintained
liaison with 911 through Karen. The fire and EMS teams arrived approximately
seven minutes after alerted. The eight trained technicians immediately began to
execute their assigned tasks. One member took over CPR; one unpacked the
portable oxygen system, fitted the mask over Rons face and initiated the flow
of oxygen into the mask; another adjusted the controls of the portable EKG
equipment; one began to apply the various leads to parts of Rons body as two
other team members cut clothing away from his body.

Over a period of 20 minutes, the eight members of the team
worked with the precision of a clock. Ron and his heart were the central focus
of all activity and effort. When Rons heartbeat was sufficiently stable and
functional, the team prepared him for transport to Penrose Main Hospital.

Fire department personnel remained behind to clean up debris
from an amazing and awe-inspiring demonstration of what can be achieved by the
perfect combination of fire and EMS team commitment, expertise, and exceptional
professional training.

Retired physician Dr. Tom Davis, Ron and Kathys next-door
neighbor, observed the fire and EMS teams in action. As the team carried Ron to
the ambulance, Tom turned to me with tears in his eyes. He slowly nodded his
head in disbelief and said in a soft but broken voice,&quot;I have worked in
many emergency situations in my career as a physician, but I have never
witnessed a team of medical technicians accomplish what this team has
accomplished under these conditions in a period of 20 minutes. They revived Rons
heart and restored his life against all odds.&quot;

A life was saved from certain death.
 
Be prepared to save a life
 
At the moment cardiac arrest occurs, breathing and all heart
function stop. Unless CPR is initiated within four to six minutes, the
probability for recovery is diminished by ten percent every minute treatment is
delayed. Even if CPR does not result in re-establishing regular breathing prior
to the arrival of a fire or EMS team, the CPR procedure supplies oxygen to the
brain by circulating the existing blood supply until additional help arrives.

Cardiac arrest is not limited to older adults. It can happen
to anyone subject to irregular heartbeat or to those involved in accidents or
situations that may induce heart arrhythmia. Without timely CPR, 95 percent of
cardiac arrest patients die en route to the hospital.

Cardiac arrest is only one of many conditions that require
immediate CPR. CPR training is invaluable for a number of other emergencies,
including choking, drowning, emotional and physical stress, genetic
abnormalities, and excessive physical exertion.

The local fire departments will arrange CPR training classes
for the public by request. Everyone should have a basic knowledge of what to do
in an emergency.&quot;Hands-on training&quot;gives us the confidence to begin
CPR at a moments notice. Time is of the essence and whoever is present must
begin CPR.

Call your local fire department to schedule training. Lets
be prepared to help sustain lifewherever and whenever the need arises.

 High Country Highlights : W inter
entertainment
 
By Woody Woodworth
 
Its easy to stir up commotion in the back yard and
transform it into a feeding frenzy for the wildlife in your area. At our house,
we have several feeding stations. Most stations are within viewing distance of a
window and have as few as one feeder, but most are multifaceted and hold two or
three feeders.

My main feeders are attached to a 4-by-4-inch pole I set in
the ground for stability. I screwed a couple of 1-by-2-by-16-inch arms
perpendicular to the pole at about 5 feet up from the ground to create a shelf
that houses a plastic saucer from the bottom of a pot. Then, I screwed the
saucer to the arms and drilled some -inch holes in it for drainage. Near the
top, I attached a metal hanger with a hook on the end that extends at an angle
about 2 feet to hold a cage with suet cakes for downy and hairy woodpeckers and
flickers.

I fill the tray with raw peanuts and whole kernel corn and
before I can turn my back, blue jays, scrub jays and stellar jays are flying in
like bombardiers to grab the prizes out of the tray. They quickly fly off to
bury their food in the leaves near the woods, only to return for another and
another until the food is gone. Their commotion arouses the fox squirrel, and he
effortlessly scales the pole to get his share of one of his favorites, only he
doesnt leave. He sits up in his&quot;throne&quot;with his tail curled over
his back and munches on a couple of peanuts as the jays try to brave getting
close enough to grab yet another piece to bury. Catherine and I believe other
animals find the peanuts that the jays bury, and we consider them helping to
feed the creatures in the woods.

One of my favorite stations is also my most colorful. Outside
a back window that views the morning sun, I hang two thistle feeders. One is a
tube feeder that is about 2 feet long and has six stations with perches and
within a couple of feet of that, I hang an eight-station octagon thistle feeder
that is quite a bit larger. When the goldfinches and house finches (red polls)
all gather on the feeders, theyll fill up every station and others will be
waiting on nearby tree branches to take the place when one bird leaves. As
spring approaches and the birds go into mating season, the goldfinches turn
vibrant yellow on their breasts and have contrasting black-striped wings. The
house finches turn shades of purple during the same time and fill that feeding
station with color.

I have two more suet feeders hanging in the back. One is
attached to the arbor and another is hanging off a 36-inch branch hook. Although
the squirrel can get to the one on the arbor, most of the time he is satisfied
with other areas in and around the yard that have easier access to feed. The
suet feeder on the branch hook is outside an office window, and its common to
see a couple of black-capped chickadees on it or have it completely covered in
pine siskins. The suet feeders are visited frequently by woodpeckers, flickers
and nuthatches.

In the far back, by the creek bed, we throw whole kernel
corn, a wild bird mix and black-oil sunflowers on the ground for the juncos,
canyon towhee, brown thrasher, squirrels and deer. I am a firm believer that
this feeding station keeps the deer out of my yard and away from eating my
bushes to the ground. It also keeps the pesky squirrels off the other feeders.
Nearby is a wire sunflower feeder full of black-oil sunflowers and, of course,
fresh water. An occasional fox strolls by for a meal to catch, or a bird of prey
may sit in the tree, waiting at their feeding station, too.

Wildlife feeding can be an enjoyable and inexpensive winter
entertainment.

 Bird Watch on the Palmer Divide: Black-billed
Magpie

 Click here or on the drawing to zoom

By Elizabeth Hacker
 
&quot;What is that beautiful bird with the long tail?&quot;is a question we are often asked by visitors from the eastern United States who
are fascinated by the coloration and grace of the black-billed magpie.

I still remember the first magpie we saw after moving here in
1990. It was standing its ground by sparring with a rabbit in our back yard.
First the rabbit kicked its hind legs at the magpie and then the magpie hopped
in front and pecked at the rabbits face. This went on for sometime, and while
magpies still frequent our yard, I havent seen a rabbit for many years, so we
assumed that the magpie was the victor in this sparring match. At first I
thought this behavior most unusual until I began hearing stories of bold magpies
harassing cats and stealing food from owls and hawks, traditionally their
predators.

The black-billed magpie is found in open country, but needs
large trees for shelter and nesting. It avoids densely forested areas and is
especially suited to the terrain of the Palmer Divide with its stands of
ponderosa pine, cottonwood and willows, interwoven with small streams, wetlands,
and open ranchland. The black-billed magpie is a member of the corvid family of
birds that include ravens, crows, and jays. Like its cousins, it is an
intelligent and resourceful opportunist.

The magpie forms large, noisy communities sometimes numbering
over 700 birds. One of my most interesting observations of this bird was in
Woodmoor, after a magpie had been struck by a car and died. It was not unlike a
human memorial service. Within seconds, a magpie flew to the dead bird to
examine its mangled body and begin to loudly call out and within minutes, what
seemed like hundreds of magpies begin to gather in the nearby trees, encircling
the body. The birds loudly called back and forth to each other. From their
perch, each magpie took its turn flying down to and walking around the dead
magpie, pecking at it and loudly shrieking as if expressing its grief over
losing a dear friend. I felt I had stumbled into a secret ceremony and still
today wonder if I was not imagining it.

Black-billed magpies are omnivores and feed primarily on
insects, especially during periods of breeding and nesting. During the winter,
its diet is higher in carbohydrates and includes seeds, berries, and pine nuts.
It also eats carrion. Most often, it eats on the ground by flipping leaves and
branches to look for food. It also eats ticks from the backs of large mammals
like bison, cattle, deer, and horses, and will clean out open sores on those
animals bodies. It uses scent to find food, an unusual trait because few
birds have a sense of smell. While often very bold, it becomes wary in areas
where it has been harassed and while nesting.

Black-billed magpies are monogamous and form long-term pairs.
Each year, the pair builds a huge new nest in the top branches of a large tree,
which in subsequent years is used by other bird species, often an owl. The nest
is dome-shaped and made of sticks. The nest is strong enough to protect the
nestlings from weather and predators and has entrances on both sides. Inside the
stick canopy is a cup-shaped nest with a mud base and lined with soft grasses,
hair, and cottonwood seeds. The typical clutch includes six to seven
olive-colored eggs, but it is not unusual to find as many as 11 eggs in a nest.
The male brings food to the female while she incubates the eggs for about 18
days. Once the eggs are hatched, both parents take turns feeding and caring for
the nestlings. In three to four weeks, the young fledge the nest to join other
broods. The parents feed their own fledglings in these large social groups for
another three to four weeks. We often see the adults teaching a fledgling to
fly, and it is truly comical.

The blacked-billed magpie is found only in the western half
of this continent from Mexico to Alaska. It is also found in Europe and Asia. It
generally does not migrate long distances but will move about in the winter
foraging for food.

The magpie has become a symbol for many cultures. In our
Native American culture, it has symbolized cunning and survival, while in
Chinese lore it symbolizes good luck and happiness. Because it has long been
known as a thief, in other cultures it has come to symbolize dishonesty.

For many years, early settlers tried to poison the magpie to
prevent it from stealing chicken eggs. For the most part, this practice has
ended. The magpie has protected status in the United States but not in Canada.

 Art Matters: On Enjoying Art, Creating
Community
 
By Janet Sellers
 
What memories are we creating in this New Year? Whatever we
are doingor not doingis what ends up building our lives. Our community is
growing in people, horses are being replaced with houses, and mellow fields are
filling with shops, streets and busy-ness. We can watch progress happen, but we
can also choose to make our progress suit us.

In my case, I grew up in the 50s in a really small town.
It came complete with hills and mountains beyond its grassy meadows, which
supported cattle and even buffalo. My birth hometown had one food market, a
lumberyard, a theater stage, and a little library. For its size, it was home to
a big population of artists. Every summer, we enjoyed the art festivals after we
swam and played at the beaches of the Pacific.

The town became famous for its art, its artists and its
beauty, but what helped it to stay healthy was a band of strong community
members who championed the water rights and reined in growth to protect the
little community.

It was a group of all kinds of people who loved where they
lived and took care of it. They encouraged public art, galleries, and arts
events. Besides the natural scenic beauty, the art and artists attracted
tourism, success and fame, which ultimately supported the town. Too bad my dads
company transferred us away from there. Oh, to have kept my Nanas little
house in Laguna Beach.

With my own children, I moved here to the Tri-Lakes area when
it had one tiny food market, a tiny library, and the kids swam, fished, and
played at the beaches of our lakes. In Tri-Lakes, we have lots of art and
artists, too. And we have art events to enjoy.

Can we build a rich life of beauty here in our community? We
are building our community in one way or another, but simply letting a community
happen to us is not an option. We vote with our support. We will get out of our
community much more than we put into it, especially as we work toward enrichment
of the people, the families, workers, visitors and businesses that are here.

The secret is to engage our selves in our community. As new
endeavors enter, and old ones retire, we can support them to be changes that are
good for all of our lives.

This isnt new for the modern person. A century ago in the
days of Monet and Renoir, people were impacted by the Industrial Revolution.
While many people flocked to factories for paying jobs, others looked at the
quality of their lives and factored in certain qualities to build their future
goals. These ideals supported communities as they built their homes and shops
and recreation areas. Their efforts are still treasured today.

In our Tri-Lakes community, well have some opportunities
to put public and private art and enrichment into the suburban eye this year.
Using the foresight of incorporating quality with progress, we can build a good
life for ourselves today that has an enriching future.

One particular venue is with the Tri Lakes Views. Its one
of many local art groups. It has begun to offer a program in our community for
public art. The current program will benefit artists works outdoors,
encourage tourism, and enrich us all each day. Contributions to the program are,
happily, tax-deductible, so donors benefit doubly well. It is a way to enrich
our community via the cultural integrity we currently have and the cultural
wealth we intend to build.

Tri Lakes Views supports efforts to preserve and disseminate
information about history, and they would like to promote the fine arts in our
area as well. In sponsoring events, creating annual events, and soliciting
sponsorships and donations, they plan to make this happen. By supporting Tri
Lakes Views, we make our public art happen.

This month, lets brave the elements for local adventurestake
in a gallery walking or driving tour through Tri-Lakes. You could begin in
Historic Monument along Second Street, down to the park and west to Third
Street. Then ride over Highway 105 to Palmer Lake and make the caf/gallery
tour finishing at Tri-Lakes Center for the Arts.
