I noticed the mention of healthier food served by subway for example, every health adviser tells you the first thing you should not eat is processed meats. Processed meats is cancer in a sandwich. Most subway sandwiches is processed meat and cheese and wheat flour which is artifical meat and salt, saturated fat and salt(cheeze) and wheat grain which is questionable if humans should even eat it. Hey just my opinion but check it out. Only you can keep yourself healthy.

I eat McDonalds Tuscan salad quite a lot, and you are mistaken, it has yogurt dressing not Garlic dressing and yes grilled chicken is much superior to crispey chicken. I live on salads and vegetables with fish and lean meats at home and I am very pleased I can get a decent meal on the road. I also drink water instead of pop or coffee and with todays coupons I can have a full meal for the price of a tip anywhere else. I don&apos;t have any vested interest in McDonalds but I am impressed with them trying to serve healthier food in an otherwise poor food industry.

If we are going to eat fast food we usually go to Subway and I turn my sub choice into a salad. These are healthy delicious and fast!

Lol @ Tina, I am a meat eater with NO cavaties and very strong teeth! I accidentally smacked myself with a rock and other hard things before right on my front teeth and they didn&apos;t even chip! hahaahah I drink milk every day, I have never broken or fractured a bone in my life even when I fell down and could have cracked my skull on the icy pavement! You are so brainwashed by the nazi vegan society and don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about!
 Submitted by hhhaahahah on Fri, 2012-06-01 5:46pm. 
That&apos;s why you only use about 1 table spoon of the salad dressing, otherwise it&apos;s still very healthy. Now when these idiots say fat do they mean the good fat that protects your heart or the bad fat? Yeah right, these salads are SOOO bad for you! LOL Thiis is so stupid. Just eat plain old lettuce then and starve yourselves to look like a skeleton.

Hello,

I have struggled with my weight my entire life. I find these articles insulting. I know if I go into a fast food restaurant and order something with rich creamy dressing, fried chicken and cheese it is not good for me. That is equally true if I order a double burger with cheese and bacon. I doubt it is necessary to publish these articles as most who have weight issues know the difference between good and bad.
Fast Food restaurants are a convenience, that we, as a society rely on.
Eating at home or veggie/vegan does not make you healthy. Last time I checked you can make cheesecake or double burgers at home and lots of Vegatarian food is high in fat or sugar!
Eating a well balanced diet,eating in moderation, excercise and rest makes you healthy.

I get annoyed when people make comments about ordering a hamburg fries and a diet coke. I get migraines from regular coke so never order it. Others may have same or similar problems. Don&apos;t always jump to your own conclusiond.

I am at the correct weight for my body and I eat once a week at Mcdonald&apos;s - burger, fries, soft drink. I also eat the salads at Wendy&apos;s. Will everyone calm down! These places aren&apos;t making you fat.....nor is the dressing, nuts, etc. In fact, nuts are healthy if you read everything Dr. Oz has to say. It is how much you eat. My Dad ate red meat 4 times a week, butter only, homo milk, lots of carbs and lived to 97 with no ailments, no pills. So stop all this nonsense and eat with PORTION control!

I&apos;m a vegetarian (eat no animals or fish) but I&apos;m no vegan (ie. i will eat eggs, milk, etc.) and have been veggie since I was 13 (I&apos;m now 32). Guys, I have terrible teeth! I have the best electric toothbrush money can buy, I eat very well (I&apos;m tall and thin and work part time for some extra cash as a model) and I see the dentist every 6 months BUT sometimes we just get stuck with our parent&apos;s genes and I take after my father who has terrible teeth. My point is this: being vegan or vegetarian really has nothing to do with good or bad teeth. Dental hygiene and most likely the genes you inherited from your parents are really what makes or breaks your teeth.
Oh, but on another note - there are lots of nutcases out there, some are militant vegans, some obsessed with steak and potatoes but if you are out there trying to find a healthy meal at a fast food joint - try Haveys and order the VEGGIE BURGER with no cheese and tons of vegetables with BBQ sauce. I have tested out all the veggie burgers out there and this one wins over even the hard core meat eaters and it&apos;s lowER in fat and better for you than the other options out there. Just a tip. Oh and then you can order the fries because you&apos;ve been good - yeah, they&apos;re also vegetarian. ;)

Once again, you have disregarded the worst of the salads&apos;offerings in fast foods&apos;restaurants. Have a look at the crispy chicken cesar salad at &quot;Boston Pizza&quot;
 Submitted by Andree on Fri, 2012-06-01 9:12am. 
I have been following a diet plan (strictly and loosely) since December 2011, and I can attest that it works. It focuses on eating the right kind of meat (lean chicken/turkey and fish). I have had little red meat during this time (while &quot;loosely&quot; following this plan). It also focuses on drinking lots of water and reducing sugar and sodium. As the diet plan progresses, more things open up in terms of what you&apos;re allowed to eat (I choose to stick to the restricted part of the plan). But I guess the point here is that - and I never thought I&apos;d say it because I love red meat - generally speaking, a healthy diet can involve regularly consuming lean meats but not red meats (the key word here is &quot;regularly&quot;). I still will have a steak once in a while, but the days of eating it (and the like) 3-4 times per week are over.

I haven&apos;t eaten in a fast food restaurant in 8 years. It used to just kill me when someone would order a big mac, ff&amp;a DIET SOFTDRINK!!!!!!! WHAT&apos;S THE POINT!!!!!!!!!
 Submitted by Barbara Olsen-Moffatt on Fri, 2012-06-01 8:16am. 
I think that both the vegans/vegetarians,and the meat eaters,are misinformed. way back when the whole vegetarian thing came about,it wasn&apos;t actually a true vegetarian diet as is today. due to storage and cleaning practices of the food stuffs, there were actually bug eggs on the food. so all though the monks and who ever thought they weren&apos;t eating animals,infact they were. also on the vegatarian side, if you respect life so much but refuse to eat meat when offered,that is probably the most disrespectful thing you could do for that life that was taken so that yours could be extended. I used to be vegetarian but after alot of thought that&apos;s what i&apos;ve learned. my reasons for becoming vegetarian was out of a respect for life. so now I do eat meat. I don&apos;t purchuse it myself,but when offered at someones home I do eat out of respect for the hosts and the animals life. as to the omnivores. I don&apos;t have any dairy in my diet. however I get lots of calcium because it is found in vegtables,fruits and in nuts.even mollasses has calcium. so you don&apos;t need milk or dairy to get your calcium at all.why do you think the milk lobby spends billions of dollars a year in commercials. they want you to think it&apos;s the only real source. many asian cultures do not have any dairy in there diets, yet they get enough calcium. so don&apos;t think it&apos;s just from dairy. also,with out weight bareing excersise,your body doesn&apos;t absorb as much calcium. if you want strong bones, you have to do these excersises. drink all the milk you want,but if your just sitting around all day your bone mass will deplete. and yes, I realize my spelling and grammer suck. how about everybody just eat what they want for whatever reasons they want. but to the people who eat meat alot. hope you realize how bad you smell. hhahhaahha

Be nice to Tina, people. You were all only eight years old once too!
 Submitted by Be Nice on Fri, 2012-06-01 2:28am. 
You have to wonder why everyone had to be so rude to pour Tina. Let&apos;s keep it polite guys. (I&apos;ll probably get trashed for this post;-)) I hope I don&apos;t make too many spelling errors.

Meat and milk have no negative effect on teeth and the calcium in milk actually strengthens teeth. Acidic drinks like juice however can desolve your enamel. That said we should be eating a mostly vegetarian diet. The fact that someone&apos;s papa ate meat and lived to 79 has no statistical significance. Perhaps if he had eaten less meat he would have lived to 89. in cultures like Japan and mediterranean countries where people eat lots of fresh fruits, vegetables and fish and small amounts of meat, people tend to live longer. Interestingly, Japanese who move to America end up with the same longevity as us within a generation as soon as they start eating Big Macs.

Everything in moderation, indulging once in a while is fine as long as you don&apos;t go overboard or make a habit of it. It has been said: &quot;there&apos;s room for all god&apos;s creatures, right next to the mashed potatoes&quot; - a proud omnivore :)

To all vegans - my father died just short of his 80th birthday - was a farmer - ate meat all his life and loved it. When he died he still had all his own teeth and NO cavities. Beat that!
I am now in my 70&apos;s and eat meat and still have all my own teeth in perfect teeth so go find another theory.

A vegan eh!! What do you think helps all those so called vegan products you eat grow ??? The answer would be animal by product ie: poop lol. No matter what you eat there is some form of animal by product. Just think about thoose mushrooms. mmmm have a great day lol.

tina your ill informed about dental health I am so happy your walking around with perfect teeth,unfortunately the world has placed far too much emphasis on having perfect white teeth,dairy does not destroy teeth nor does meat,but in you ill conceived mind you do not know the current dental practises involving cavities,makes me wonder if you have even seen a dentist.
 Submitted by Paul on Tue, 2011-12-13 3:25pm. 
I just added up the sodium content on the salads listed. Using the lable on my table salt box in my cupboard 570 mg = 1/4 tsp. Doing the calculations all of these salads have 1/2 to almost 1 tsp of salt! If there was indeed that much salt in a salad you would not be able to eat it. All you would taste is salt so this writer needs to go back to the drawing board and recalculate the numbers.

As for teeth, meat and dairy does NOT rot your teeth but strengthen them. Your bones will decay if you do not have enough calcium in your diet. The calcium found in water is a poor substitue for dairy. Vegans please change your diet to save your health. The diet you have is not safe to live on. Do your research again. Look at history, people have eaten meat since the beginning of time.
 Submitted by Chef on Tue, 2011-12-13 3:21pm. 
The way I see it, weather your eating a whole cow or a green salad, nothing takes the place of a well balanced intake of foods. We can all enjoy the finer foods that taste great. It is a consious effort that we have to put forth to balance the foods we eat with a regular cardiovascular exercise program as well. Sensible eating and exercise will allow us to eat anything we want and still look great.

I would just like to say that I am 32 years old, I still have all of my own teeth, have never had a filling and I eat meat (even the odd fast food meal!).
 Submitted by lissa on Tue, 2011-12-13 1:58pm. 
Tina,
best not to try and force your convictions on others. Especially if they involve controversial science and/or topics. I am not a vegan at this time but have been for many years in the past. I just wanted to put some info into this fast food ether chat. Meat and animal products (generally) contribute to a more acidic ph balance to the body, overall, though I am sure that some veg products do the same, but few compared to the animal products. A change in the PH balance of the body can be deadly and lead to various diseases. This goes for a body with a ph that is too acidic or basic.
If you guys are really interested in learning the truth it is probably best not to believe everything that your dentist or md says. Do some research and make a decision for yourself based on what information you believe. That is really all anyone can do.
If you care about learning more check out:
pleomorphism
or
royal raymond rife.

I also don&apos;t care if anyone attacks my spelling...so do your worst.
Also, to the omnivores, try not to fight back so much. Vegetarians, like omnivores, feel that
everyone is out to get them...:(

Calcium, which is found in DAIRY is actually good for your teeth.
nice try tina. You&apos;re correct with part of your assumption that eating fast food causes cavities. The amount of sugary drinks and pop they serve is astounding.

Who says that life in Canada isn&apos;t stressful?
 Submitted by bryan on Tue, 2011-12-13 10:20am. 
I am sure Tina is checking the dictionary to determine which spelling errors she made, as was I. With the exception of missing an &quot;r&quot; in the word mercury, which she later spelled correctly, I have been trying to determine where the spelling errors appeared. The grammar (including punctuation and missing capitals) was less than stellar, but I understood exactly what she was communicating. And while it appeared to be written with a &quot;mightier than thou&quot; attitude, I think she is just misinformed on nutrition.

Tina, have you ever watched a &quot;Milk&quot; commercial on television? Milk is a dairy product - and the advertisers have spent millions to communicate the fact that milk builds strong teeth and bones. The Dairy Council would be very upset if anyone actually believed what you are stating, as it is not true. Mother Nature created milk for all babies to live off of for the first years of their lives. Dairy and meat products rot your teeth? Who told you this? I don&apos;t know about anyone else - but my mother and my dentist told me from the time I was a little girl that candy would rot your teeth - anything with sugar. I recommend you do some reading on the causes of tooth decay and be aware and sensitive to the fact that not all problems are caused by poor oral hygiene, and they are certainly not caused by eating meat or dairy products. You are also probably not old enough yet to understand that your teeth get more brittle with age - just like your bones - and they crack, and they might even fall out. So be prepared that a diet lacking in calcium will bring that aging process on a lot sooner.

First of all, eating meat and dairy does not rot or dissolve your teeth. Acidic food can cause break down of the enamel. Lots of acidic foods are FRUIT!!
And if teenagers and lots of people out there have nice teeth, it is because they go to the dentist and have check ups and cleanings every 6 months and brush everyday.
Most dentists no longer use mercury fillings and I have seen many people at age 40+ with no fillings who are omnivores!
Tina, you give vegans and vegetarians a bad name! Does being vegan make you unable to spell?
 Submitted by Brenda on Mon, 2011-12-12 5:54pm. 
So glad to hear that you&apos;re a vegan snob, Tina.

Maybe instead of being so proud of eating a diet unnatural to human beings, you could concentrate on getting some education so that you that you&apos;re entries don&apos;t come off as drunken diatribes.

Agreed, not all salads are good, but does your diet have to affect your spelling so badly??
 Submitted by mary w on Fri, 2010-12-31 12:52pm. 
I love having my own teeth with no cavities in my head and that is why I do not eat meat or dairy products that dissolves teeth and bones.‏

I am a vegan. Firstly, I have all my own teeth and I have no cavities or filling. I do not eat meat as I do not want a mouth full of rotten teeth or false teeth ( a gum smacking mouth). I do not want a mouth filled with mecury fillings like all teenagers who eat macdonalds,KFC, and a meat-based diet - they all require mercury filling to hold what is left of their crumply,rotten, and brittle-looking teeth in their head.

I love my teeth and bones and that is why I would never dream of eating meat just look at all the young teenagers and adults around you and their rotten teeth which are all remolded and all the false teeth.

Yours sincerely,
