The Colonel vs. Flavor Flav -- Chicken Wars
 1/24/2011 5:40 AM PST BY TMZ STAFF The Colonel vs. Flavor Flav -- Chicken Wars Flavor Flav opened his chicken joint in the wrong part of town -- cause the guy who owns the Kentucky Fried Chicken RIGHT NEXT DOOR says he&apos;s ready to go clock-to-clock for fried chicken supremacy.

 Flav&apos;s joint is set to open today in Clinton, IA -- the first of a planned chain of restaurants. But the new place just happens to be next to a KFC -- which just seems like awful planning, doesn&apos;t it?

Anyway, the guy who owns that KFC tells TMZ, &quot;We&apos;ve been in business since 1963, we always welcomed competition. We have competed with six or seven brands over that time and as long as we take care of The Colonel&apos;s chicken, we will be just fine.&quot;

Looks like we&apos;re in for one helluva chicken battle ... boyyyyyyeeeee!!!!!

I&apos;d rather have Flavor Flav too! KFC is boring and has a weird taste.

I&apos;d eat chicken a monkey fried before I went to KFC. It&apos;s greasy and causes a catastrophic event within my stomach.

Opening a chicken place next to an established chicken chain ain&apos;t the smartest move. But on the other hand have you tried KFC lately? It&apos;s soggy! Nobody wants soggy fried chicken.

Good eye Damon, that&apos;s exactly what it is.

That said I can&apos;t wait to go there and make an order and have Flav himself jump on the counter and yelll YEAH BOY when I ask for an extra biscuit or side of cole slaw.

Popeyes is much better than KFC even though I haven&apos;t eaten either in years. Where does the stench of that &quot;grilled&quot; chicken come from anyway?

The Who own the KFC right next door? I didn&apos;t know The Who were in the fried chicken business. I like Roger Daltrey.

To Damon: Noticed the LJS connection right away, also...you beat me to the post. Good job. (Does this mean we eat way too much take out junk food?)

I am almost annoyed by this. Of all places for him to bring this place, it had to be MY town? I am all for new things and creating new jobs, but this is tragic.

If it lasts more than a couple of years, I will be impressed. The &quot;business partner&quot; who will be running this isn&apos;t exactly what I would call trustworthy.
