		GO GREEN
 Hand Dryers vs. Paper Towels October 1, 2008       
Hand dryers are probably one of the least popular ways to Greenify a business. They are loud, users think dryers leave skin without natural oils, and that they sometimes seem to take forever to work. But they should be among the most popular ways to go green with business owners. Why?

One report estimates that for the average fast food restaurant’s restrooms to use paper towels for a year requires the wood product equivalent of 9 full grown trees and creates 1000 pounds of landfill waste in that same time period. During the same timeframe, operating a hand dryer saves as much as 80% in energy costs, plus landfill fees, plus lowering labor costs because hand dryers don’t require maintenance.   

And we should point-out, hand-dryers are a changing, evolving asset that itself is growing greener day by day. The newest models claim they save even more energy (cutting operational costs as much as 98%), drying hands in 10 seconds or less, and providing greater hygiene than ever before.

In fact, a Canadian study claims that the warm air blown across the skin surface does slightly dehydrate the skin, which leads to a decreased ability for microorganisms to grow and penetrate the tiny crevasses on the skins surface, where as absorbent towels may not provide the same protection, even though the skin appears dryer.
There you have it: easier on the environment, lower energy and labor costs, faster and more hygienic, too. 

What could make a decision to Greenify better?
