 I feel like I haven&apos;t updated LJ in forever. I know it&apos;s been a long time. I just haven&apos;t been myself lately; I think I&apos;ve been depressed, mostly over work. I haven&apos;t written much of anything new in nearly two years, I quit learning to draw, I haven&apos;t socalized much (I really should reopen my CollarMe.com account *LOL*) and I just haven&apos;t felt motivated to do much at all. I think it&apos;s time for that to change though. I was fired (unjustly, IMO) from my job... and, truthfully, I think it was the best thing to happen to me in a long time! I miss the money, but I sure don&apos;t miss the stress or the person that job turned me into. I&apos;m currently on a three week vacation at my granny&apos;s in Ohio, I got to go to the family reunion for the first time in about seven years, and I think the change in location and the happiness of seeing family again, has also had something to do with my improved mood. I really do feel more like myself again, and that&apos;s a good thing.

As I said, I&apos;m on vaction in Ohio, so I don&apos;t really want to do a long post right now, but when I get back to Las Vegas I plan on posting everything that&apos;s happened lately, updating my writing schedual, starting some fresh projects, updating my rec reading lists... a whole lot of stuff. I spend more time on FaceBook (so much easier to update quickly) than LJ these days, but I&apos;ll definately have a big update to post here in the next few weeks. I also plan on keeping up with LJ more, even if just for writing and a few brief updates now and then. Keep an eye out for me... I&apos;ll be back!

Luv you all!!!

P.S. - I wish I was at Comic-Con. Anybody who is there: have fun for those of us who couldn&apos;t make it! Maybe next year? comments: 7 comments or Leave a comment

 I&apos;ve been completely MIA from LJ for a while. I&apos;m sorry. The major reason (one of them, anyway) has been that the only computers I have access to are either slow or complete POSs. But I used my tax return money to order myself a new computer that should be much better, and have me not only back on LJ more often, but also get me back to writing and posting new fics. Stay with me, I&apos;ll be back real soon... I promise!

I&lt;3 YOU ALL!!!!

Oh, and btw: I cheated and looked at the east coast results show for &quot;American Idol&quot; online a little while ago. It&apos;s currently airing here in the west coast, but it&apos;s already too late, I know what happens. And I&apos;m crushed! WTF? Sending Paul home? Big mistake! I know, he&apos;s not the normal Idol mold singer, but he&apos;s made of awesome. Why in the hell is he going home before either of the remaining girls, neither of which can hold a candle to any of the boys this season? I&apos;ve still got James, Casey, and Scotty to vote for, but I&apos;m still sad to see Paul leave. :( I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll do well, even without winning AI; I for one can&apos;t wait to buy his first CD. comments: 13 comments or Leave a comment

 Spent last weekend on the Las Vegas strip. Had a free room at Harrah&apos;s (not as bad as I expected) and then at Rio (very nice. the rooms were bigger than my first apartment.) Saw a steampunk themed magic show with way too much dancing. Very weird.

Went to see the newest &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movie the week it came out. Loved it. Very dark, and I cried through most of it (*LOL*) but I really enjoyed it. Can&apos;t wait to see the final movie.

I&apos;m fighting a killer cold right now. I&apos;ve spent most of the time in bed and catching up on my DVRs. Finished the latest season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; finally. The 11th doctor just never grew on me, and neither did Amy, but I did enjoy the last few episodes of the season. I&apos;m hoping for more River Song in the next season. I&apos;m catching up on cartoons now. &quot;Venture Brothers&quot; for now, and maybe &quot;Metalocolypse&quot; later.

It&apos;s shift bid time again at work. I liked my current shift, but it&apos;s not available any more. My new shift is going to be 1.15-9.15 with Thur/Fri off. I wanted a 32 hour shift again, but they were all mornings, and I just don&apos;t do mornings. comments: 10 comments or Leave a comment

 Don&apos;t have much of excitement to write about, but I just wanted to let you all know that even though I&apos;ve been quiet lately I&apos;m reading all of your posts. I&apos;m still here, promise. The weather here in Vegas is still really nice (we&apos;ve actually had 80+ temps this week) but it&apos;s kind of annoying because I go to work around noon and get off at midnight, so I&apos;m too hot if I wear anything heavy to work, and I hate to carry a heavy coat to the bus, but when I get off I&apos;m freezing my ass off some nights! I know I complain about the heat here all the time, and I sure as hell don&apos;t miss the cold of Ohio winters, but this is almost as bad. Then again, if I didn&apos;t have something to complain about I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d be happy *LOL*

I&apos;ve inherated my brother&apos;s old phone. It cost him over $200, and I could never spend that for a damn phone, but now that I have his I love it. I finally have an unlimited talk/text/web plan. Since I work on the phone for eight hours a day, the talk portion of my plan dosen&apos;t excite me much, but I&apos;m loving the text/web parts. I joined twitter and update my facebook all the time now. I have to wonder if anybody really cares about my endless updates, but at least it amuses me. If any of you are on Twitter and want to add/friend/whatever me, I&apos;m TWKitty369.

I&apos;m a little down this week because of something that happened to my oldest brother. He has a wife who&apos;s a few years older than him (considering he&apos;s from my mom&apos;s first marriage and I just turned 30, he&apos;s no spring chicken and this means that she isn&apos;t either) and neither one of them has ever had children, although he wants them. They&apos;ve tried to get pregnant a few times over the past five years or so (they live in New Orleans, and we didn&apos;t exactly grow up together, so I&apos;m not as up on everything about their lives as I&apos;d like to be... I keep missing family reunions because of work) and have gotten pregnant a few times, but they keep loosing the babies early into the pregnancies. This time they got pregnant and didn&apos;t tell anybody for a while, because they were sure to loose this one too. They finally told us a few months back because things were looking good. The baby was to be born sometime early this month, and things were still looking good, then I got a voicemail from my Grandma this past Sunday night (they&apos;re in Ohio, so there&apos;s a time difference) but since my phone is new I didn&apos;t even have the voicemail set up yet. I was kind of curious about the little flashing red thing on my phone screen, so I tried to set up my voicemail durring a break at work, and when I finally did all my Gran said was, &quot;This is your grandmother. Could you have your mom give me a call. Love ya.&quot; She didn&apos;t sound right, and everyone in my family knows about my aversion to phone calls, so the fact that she&apos;d called me worried me a lot. I called my mom and tolder her to call Gran, and I also texted my aunt (my aunt and grandmother live together, and they&apos;re in NOLA all the time) to see if everything is okay. When I went to lunch a little while later I saw a text from my aunt, and she told me that my brother and sister-in-law had lost their unborn son the day before he was born. I hadn&apos;t seen her when she was pregnant, I&apos;d never touched her belly or felt my nephew kicking, I probably wouldn&apos;t have ever even met the poor kid unless he grew up and decided to come to Vegas, but I was still hit kind of hard by it. I couldn&apos;t leave work, and I knew that getting upset wouldn&apos;t help anyone, but I just started crying. Anyone who knows me IRL knows that I never cry in front of anyone, not for real. Sure, if you give me a good book or a sad movie I&apos;ll bawl my eyes out and not be the least ashamed, but if something real pops up in my life I freeze up and don&apos;t show my pain to anyone. (I should probably seek help form a therapist, I&apos;m emotially unavailable and completely messed up internally at times) I tried to stop, I&apos;m not even sure what I was crying about except that I feel awful that my brother has to keep going through this when I know how badly he just wants a family, but before I knew it I&apos;d walked half way through the casino, in the wrong way, and my face was wet. I had to duck into a bathroom to wipe my face, and that&apos;s where I just started sobbing. I couldn&apos;t even eat my lunch. When I tried to go back to work my friend Amanda noticed that something was wrong, and she hugged me when I started crying again (sometimes I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do without Amanda, she&apos;s such an awesome person and a great friend, and I&apos;m very lucky to have her in my life) before I could stop myself. When I got home I cried some more, but I didn&apos;t let my mom see me do it, because I&apos;m sure she&apos;s hurting more than I am. We don&apos;t really talk about our feelings much at my house, we&apos;re all messed up that way, but I know that we&apos;re all feeling the loss of a baby that we never even got the chance to know. Considering how many idiot teenagers and wellfare crack whores get accidently knocked up every damn day (my stupid, drug addicted, extremely troubled cousin had his first child on his 18th birthday; and the child has been left for his father and step-mother to raise) it just seems so unfair that people who really want a child and would be wonderful parents can&apos;t have a child. I&apos;d love to get to go down to New Orleans to be with them (not that it would do any good) for a little while, but that&apos;s just not an option. Besides, I&apos;d probably put my damn foot in my mouth at some point in the visit by reminding them that adoption is a better option than ever trying again (I never want to have a child, but I do sometimes consider adopting an older child. Not that they&apos;d ever give me on *LOL*) and I&apos;m sure that&apos;s the last thing they want to hear right now.

Sorry to get so down, how about I try to make the rest of the update a little more upbeat: I finished &quot;Fable 3&quot; (don&apos;t remember if I already mentioned this) about a week or two back. I had fun, really, but after all of the hype I was a little unimpressed. The side quests to gain friends got really repetitive, and the fighting was overly easy most of the time, and everything just seemed too simple. On the up side, it was fun most of the time, and once I became king I had a lot of fun ruling. One thing that always annoyes me about RPGs (and video games in general) is that you&apos;re usually fighting to liberate/rule/take over/create the kingdom, and you spend the whole game fighting to that aim, but once you accomplish this seemingly impossible task that you&apos;ve fought so hard to accomplish... GAME OVER. WTF? I work that hard and don&apos;t get to enjoy the spoils of my struggle? So, at least in this game they let you enjoy the kingship that you fought so hard for. I just wish that part of the game had been a bit longer. They kept saying that the midpoint would be you becomming king or queen, but I don&apos;t think that you rule for even the final 1/4 of the game. It was actually a pretty short game too. Aside from some finsih-up work looking for gnomes (the replacement for the gargoyles from the second game) and flowers, as well as a few accomplishments that I didn&apos;t get in the normal play, I think I finished the whole thing in less than a month. And trust me, I do way more side quests than most people, so if it took me that long then most people wouldn&apos;t even need that much time to finish. My overall opinion? A good game that could have been so much better. I think now I&apos;ll try to finish &quot;Kingdom Hearts re: Chain of Memories&quot; on my PS2. I hate the damn card battle system. I keep getting my ass kicked by Vexen! But the game is so pretty (and I love anything with Axel in it, I&apos;m an Axel/Roxas shipper *LOL*) and I&apos;m such a KH fan that I can&apos;t not finish it. Eventually. I&apos;ve actually been playing it, on and off, for months. Then I&apos;ll have to find something new to play. Any suggestions? I&apos;ve got a PS2, Xbox 360, and Wii. I&apos;m kind of liking these previews/commercials for the newest &quot;Assassins Creed&quot; game, thinking that maybe I could go back and play the first one, but I&apos;m not sure. I prefer RPGs, don&apos;t do shooter games and usually don&apos;t do fighting ones either. I tried the &quot;Devil my Cry&quot; games and couldn&apos;t get the hang of the movement/battle stuff, and I worry that &quot;Assassins Creed&quot; might be similar to that. Anybody?

Watched the season premire of &quot;Human Target&quot; on FOX tonight. I really like that show, especially Jackie Earle Haley (the new Freddy Kruger). A bit of mother/daughter time in front of the tv.

Tomorrow I&apos;d like to head down to WalMart to pick up this pretty purple pre-lit Christmas tree and a few decorations. I hate that the stores have started putting up holiday decorations a month before Halloween, but as far as I&apos;m concerned once October 31st has ended we can start decorating. I&apos;ve already go quite a few presents (I love having a GoodWill within walking distance to my house. They&apos;re good stuff, and the people I give them to don&apos;t need to know where I got them from.) and I&apos;d like to get them wrapped and have a tree to put them under. That&apos;s the plan, anyway. Maybe then I&apos;ll hit the DVR and see what I can find. I still have half the most recent season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (not too impressed with 12 so far) to watch, I&apos;m a week behind on &quot;Glee&quot; (loved the &quot;Rocky Horror Pictureshow&quot; ep.), I still want to try &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;Kekkaishi&quot;, plus I haven&apos;t watched all of this season of either &quot;The Venture Brothers&quot; or &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;. Oh, and I need to finish S1 of &quot;Haven&quot;. No wonder I have no life, if someone looked at this update to my LJ they&apos;d think I do nothing but watch TV *LOL* Very sad. I need to try to prep my study for a paint job too. Maybe with a redesign I might finally find the energy flow to be correct and I can start writing again. I wanted to get a lot of these things done today too, but I ended up over sleeping and didn&apos;t even get out of bed until after 4pm (I didn&apos;t go to bed until after 5am though); maybe I&apos;ve been feeling so tired because I needed to catch up on my sleep though. Hopefully I got that out of the way last night *LOL* I&apos;m gonna have a drink now (I love the man/men/women who invented Mike&apos;s Hard Leomnade in pink lemonade flavor) and try to get back to bed. G&apos;night all! comments: 7 comments or Leave a comment

 Tags: ghosts , halloween , life , vacation , weird , work Current Music: TV - The Crazies Current Location: Home Security: Subject: Happy Halloween! Time: 06:26 pm Current Mood: curious 
 
 I&apos;m off for the next two weeks. Yay! My vacation didn&apos;t start too well: my indoor-only cat, Toast, somehow got out into the garage and pulled the metal grate off of the one hole in the garage wall. My mom and I walked all over the neighbor hood, twice, looking for him. I couldn&apos;t even sleep the night he was missing. Then, last night (or this morning, however you want to look at it) I hear a meow, opened the door to the garage, and he walked right back in! He hasn&apos;t left my side since. I&apos;m so glad he&apos;s home.

Today&apos;s Halloween. My brother was supposed to get married today and there was to be a costume part at my house, but he got his hours slashed a few weeks agao and they ended up canceling the wedding until finaces are better. So, no plans tonight. And I had three different costumes to choose from! *LOL* But, since I don&apos;t feel great today I guess it&apos;s worked out in my favor this time.

Something weird, in honor of the holiday: Most of you know that I&apos;m Pagan. I had on my pentagram, since today is a religious holiday for us, and a few &quot;hauted&quot; rings. I started feeling really faint/lightheaded, so I went upstairs to lie down. I took off the costume (a midevil type priestess costume, like a red crushed velvet dress with a big hood/sleeves) I had on, so I was in a sports bra and panties, and I lied down for a while. When I got up I still didn&apos;t feel good, so I decided to take a bath. Now, I have the master bedroom, and in my bathroom there&apos;s only a shower, so I had to leave my room to take a bath. I have a full wall of mirrors and another huge mirror sitting up against another wall; I saw myself in just bra and panties, and there wasn&apos;t a mark on my body. I went into the hall bathroom, took off what I had on, and started the bath running. I turned around, caught sight of myself in the mirror, and was more than a little surprised to see a six inch, bright red cross imprinted on the outside of my right thigh! It was a perfect cross! I don&apos;t know where it could have come from, I didn&apos;t have anything on that could have caused the pattern, and it wasn&apos;t there when I&apos;d been in my room minutes before. It was really imprinted deep in my flesh, I couldn&apos;t rub it off/out, and none of the surrounding skin was affected (I&apos;m pretty pale, in case you don&apos;t know, so it really stood out) at all. It was really weird. I called my mom up and had her take a look at it, and she couldn&apos;t figure it out either. She just told me to put my pentagram back on and forgett about it *LOL* I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a logical explanation, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve got an undead religous zelott living in my house marking up the heathens or anything, but it was still a little odd and more than a little unsettling.

I&apos;m gonna watch some good (or bad, depending on how you look at it) horror films and plenty of haunted specials and head to bed I guess. Hope you guys all have a happy holiday! comments: Leave a comment

 Just felt like posting to say that I&apos;m still here. I use FaceBook a bit more than LJ lately because it is a bit quicker, but once I start writing again I&apos;ll be back on LJ more. Promise.

Nothing new to most of you, but I&apos;m sick. A lot. I just spent most of the past five days in bed. I&apos;m feeling a little bit better today, which is good, but I&apos;ve got to go back to work tomorrow while not feeling 100%. We&apos;ll see how it goes.

On the up side, I had stuff on my DVR from March of this year, so I needed to do some catching up. What&apos;s better to keep your mind off an achey body than a whole lot of TV to watch, right? I watched the rest of last season&apos;s &quot;Glee&quot; that I hadn&apos;t caught up on, and although my damn DVR ate the season premire, I&apos;m all caught up for next week. Wasn&apos;t this past Tuesday&apos;s a tearjearker? I caught up on &quot;Boondocks&quot;, which I didn&apos;t really think was the best of the series, but it was mostly funny anyway. I also watched all of S1 of &quot;FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot;, which I loved. Pretty, and amusing, and just as good as the first series. (Maes&apos; death makes me cry everytime, crybaby that I am *LOL*) I can&apos;t wait to see S2. I really need to catch up on the manga too. I also got partially caught up on the newest season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The stories have been interesting enough, and I&apos;ve got nothing against Amy exactly, but I just can&apos;t seem to get into the newest Doctor. Am I the only one? Oh, and I finally finished &quot;Spartacus: Blood and Sand&quot;. I thought, over all, it was a pretty good series. Too bad there won&apos;t be a second season now that their lead&apos;s cancer has come back. A real shame. Sitting in front of the TV (or laying, as it was) may not be the most productive way to spend a week, but it helped to pass the time.

I also finished another run of &quot;Fable 2&quot;. When I finally hooked up internet to my XBox I couldn&apos;t combine my offline account with my XBox Live account, so I scrapped everything and started fresh. Can&apos;t wait to pick up my order of the special edition of &quot;Fable III&quot; later this month!

Guess I&apos;ll try to get to bed early and get in a little more rest before work tomorrow. Hope all of you are doing well. I&apos;ll try to post again soon. TTFN! comments: 1 comment or Leave a comment

 I can&apos;t believe Sunday is my 30th birthday. 30?!? When did I get so old. (Yes, I know, 30 isn&apos;t really that old, but I still feel like I just graduated highschool yesterday.) On the up side, it&apos;s a paid holiday at work. I love getting my birthday counted as a holiday *LOL*

We&apos;re getting the house slowly but surely painted. We&apos;ve got a dark green accent wall, most of the downstairs and hallway are a pale sage-ish green, and grey trim for everything. The kitchen accent wall is in pumpkin. My bedroom is purple. I like it. Some of the bathrooms will eventually get a repaint, and my study and my parents&apos; bedroom still need color, but it&apos;s getting there.

I&apos;ve been tired all weekend. I went shopping Tuesday, but I just stayed in the house Wednesday and Thursday. Watched &quot;True Blood&quot; with Mom. Am I the only one that felt kind of bad for Talbot, since he hadn&apos;t actually done anything to Eric? And Russell&apos;s tv broadcast? If the news were that interesting I might start watching it more *LOL* Can&apos;t wait for next week! I&apos;ve also started playing &quot;Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories&quot;. I know, I&apos;m way behind with KH games, but I played KH, KH2, and CoM on DS, I&apos;ve just never gotten around to this one. I think there&apos;s another one too? 365/7 or something? Anyway, this one is fun, if a little simplistic. So pretty! I hope there&apos;s a KH3 sometime soon. Between this and a replay of DA:O (I haven&apos;t even started the DLCs, I just love DA:O enough that it keeps me well occupied.)

Gotta go back to work tomorrow. Sleepy. I think I&apos;ll head off to bed early. Just hope I can sleep. comments: 1 comment or Leave a comment

 So, I remembered yesterday that I&apos;d never finished playing Fable II. Since we hooked up the XBox in the living room so I could play Rock Band with more space (I&apos;ve got the drums and guitar, and my study just isn&apos;t big enough for all of that!) I realized that I should finish it. The good news is that, as it turns out, I was very nearly done. Fifteen minutes or so and I was at the final battle. Bad news is, the ending was so anti-climatic that I wasn&apos;t even sure if it was over until the credits rolled! Serioulsy! Worst ending ever. Really. But, even though it was a big let down in the end, I&apos;m still really looking forward to the release of part three. Anybody else agree with me on the epic fail that is the ending of Fable II?

In other news, my parents have wanted to get a great dane for years. We had one when I was a kid, but he turned way overprotective towards me and we had to get rid of him. So, recently they found a great dane rescue group here in Vegas. They had talked about maybe going to see one soon. Then, tomorrow, when I get off the bus after work, there was a 150 lbs black and white creature waiting with my mom! WTF?! So glad I was consulted on this, considering it&apos;s my house and I pay the majority of the bills, and I&apos;m still freaked out by the psycho dog that thought I was his propterty as a kiddo. I was pretty weirded out last night, but she&apos;s such a softie that I can&apos;t stay that way. This dog is a two year old purebreed with champions on both sides, she&apos;s harliquinn with her ears done. She also thinks she&apos;s a lapdog, perhapse owing to the fact that she grew up with chiwawas (I know that&apos;s mispelled, I can&apos;t be bothered to look up the correct spelling) along with her fellow danes *LOL* She&apos;s about 150 lbs and apparently she&apos;s actually a little under weight! She seems pretty sweet too. Her original name was Lilly, which is a name that I actually like, but Mom doesn&apos;t like that name. She wanted to call it LadyBug, but I just won&apos;t have a giant dog named lady bug in my house! Tonight I thought of calling her Dezzy, short for Desdemona. From &quot;Hamlet&quot;? Since she&apos;s a great DANE? Get it? *LOL* I thought I was pretty clever with that one, until I remembered that Desdemona is from &quot;Othello&quot; and Ophelia is from &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Now I don&apos;t know what to call her. Any suggestions?

I&apos;ve got a free suite at the PH Towers (the timeshare behind Planet Hollywood) tomorrow night. I got a cute new dress, no plans, and desire to get into trouble ;) We&apos;ll see what happens *LOL* comments: 2 comments or Leave a comment
