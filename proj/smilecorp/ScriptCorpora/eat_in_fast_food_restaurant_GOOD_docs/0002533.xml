Is That a Kielbasa in Your Pocket?

It occurred to me today that it&apos;s a long, long time from May to December, but the days grow short when you reach September. 1 Which means that by November, the days have grown short enough that Grumpy and Sneezy could drive the lane on them. The race to get home before sunset has once again become an even-money proposition, and the smart money&apos;s on the sun.

All of which means another year has slipped by us 2 without a major weight loss or a personal best time or an organized garage or a last will and testament. How does this happen every year?

God, in Her wisdom, has seen to it that the Yankees still haven&apos;t won a pennant in the 21st Century, so we know that there are some fronts on which the forces of evil and sloth have been reduced to a holding action. But a year that winds down with the Secretary of the Treasury holding a gun to the economy and saying,&quot;Give me $700 billion dollars in unmarked bills or Wall Street dies,&quot;is not one you&apos;re gonna want to paste into your memory book next to the senior prom.

So I am especially pleased to brighten your skies with the announcement of the winner of this year&apos;s annual Jimmy Dean Best Crime Committed With a Sausage Award.

Some of you may have noticed that the annual Jimmy Dean Best Crime Committed With a Sausage Award has been something less than strictly annual of late. Sausage crime seems to have fallen off now that the Department of Homeland Security has put sausages on its list of dangerous terrorist devices, along with the eyeglass cleaning solution I was required to discard before my last flight. 3 

So you can imagine how pleased I was when loyal reader Jeff Williams of Schiff Hardin in San Francisco 4 sent me the article describing this year&apos;s award-winning entry. The article is from the Fresno Bee. 5 It begins,&quot;A burglar who broke into a home just east of Fresno rubbed food seasoning over the body of one of two men as they slept in their rooms and then used an 8-inch sausage to whack the other man on the face and head before running out of the house, Fresno county sheriff&apos;s deputies said Saturday.&quot;

Wow. Breathtaking, isn&apos;t it. Read that over again and you&apos;ll begin to understand why sausage crimes get their very own award.

Food seasoning. He rubbed&quot;Pappy&apos;s Seasoning&quot;- a local product, highly prized in Fresno epicurean circles - on the body of a sleeping man. Why would anybody want to do that? And why would they want to do it so much they would break into a home in the dead of night to accomplish it? 6 

Unfortunately, the Bee&apos;s article does not identify WHICH&quot;Pappy&apos;s Seasoning&quot;was used. Obviously, the intent of the burglar is much more difficult to divine without knowing whether he used&quot;Pappy&apos;s Choice Seasoning,&quot;&quot;Pappy&apos;s Louisiana Hot Spice,&quot;or&quot;Pappy&apos;s Prime Rib Rub,&quot;and I would have expected a fine paper like the Bee to have been more specific. But, as you can imagine, police are often very tight-lipped about details with sausage crime, for fear of inspiring copycat crimes, so the dearth of information on this point may have reflected official law enforcement policy as much as reportorial indolence.

As is often the case with sausage crime, the intent is largely inferable from the suspect&apos;s attire. In this case, the suspect, one Antonio Vasquez Jr., 21, of Fresno,&quot;ran out of the house wearing only a t-shirt, boxer shorts and socks, leaving behind his wallet with his ID.&quot;Why are we not surprised by this news?

This tells us a couple of rather disturbing things. But before we get to them, let&apos;s pause for a moment to contemplate once again the unimaginably strange life of a peace officer. These poor cops were summoned to a nighttime&quot;burglary in progress call,&quot;a serious felony that can be expected to both wake up your adrenal glands and unfasten the strap on your holster at pretty much the same time. So after preparing to confront Charles Manson, bloody knife in hand, they instead ended up arresting a nearly naked guy who had slathered seasoning rub on one sleeping victim and then whacked the other with a tube of meat. How do you survive adrenaline roller coaster rides like that with even a tenuous grip on sanity?

Alright, now that we&apos;ve had a moment to thank the Lord that our son or daughter didn&apos;t go into a field as mental-health-threatening as law enforcement, let&apos;s get back to the couple of rather disturbing things I mentioned at the start of the last paragraph. Try to keep up, here. I don&apos;t have time to re-write these things into a cohesive structure with linear trains of thought. I have a day job.

First, of course, the leaving behind the wallet thing is an obvious cry for help. It would be difficult to say,&quot;Stop me before I rub seasoning on people and hit them with a sausage again,&quot;more clearly. In fact, if you just ask yourself how many times in your life you&apos;ve heard someone say,&quot;Stop me before I rub seasoning on people and hit them with a sausage again,&quot;you will realize how difficult it must be to say that at all, much less clearly. So leaving behind your ID is probably the best way to do it. 7 

Second, it tells us the burglar apparently disrobed partially before beginning his nefarious seasoning and sausage-wielding activities. 8 To a trained student of the criminal psyche, this speaks volumes. The difference in culpability between a fully-clothed sausage-wielding seasoning-rubber and a boxer-clad t-shirt-wearing sausage-wielding seasoning-rubber is . . . well . . . huge.

Which, of course, brings us to the sausage. The eight-inch sausage. 9 To me, the sausage is the key to the case.

Let me explain. Antonio Vasquez allegedly 10 broke into the home of two farmworkers outside Fresno, stripped to his underwear, and then began rubbing one of the men with Pappy&apos;s Seasoning and beating the other with a sausage. The men awoke, Antonio boogied, and was apprehended in a nearby field in his underwear. His ID was found at the scene, along with his pants, and he was hiding - sans pants - in a nearby field, so this is not exactly a whodunit.

Intent will be the issue here. Under California law, burglary is the entry of a building with the intent to commit a theft or a felony. If you don&apos;t have one of those intents, you aren&apos;t a burglar. So if Antonio didn&apos;t take anything, he may be able to beat the rap, if the prosecution cannot show he intended to commit a felony.

I was a prosecutor for 15 years. I can imagine the consternation generated in the D. A.&apos;s Office by the collective effort to figure out what felony Antonio might have had in mind. I&apos;m sure their Sausage Crimes Task Force has been burning the midnight oil trying to find a felony that fits these facts.&quot;Let&apos;s see, what crime involves rubbing meat seasoning on your victim? Uh, well that would be . . . um . . . uh . . .that would be . . . um . . . Well, wait a minute; the guy was half-naked. Obviously, his intent with the seasoning was to . . . to . . . uh . . . Um, the sausage; don&apos;t forget the sausage. Clearly, he was going to commit the crime of . . . the crime of . . . Aw, sh_t, it&apos;s gotta be something!&quot;

Hence, the importance of the sausage. Assault with a deadly weapon, or assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily harm would be felonies. Those are general intent crimes that wouldn&apos;t require six Freudians and a cultural anthropologist to sell to a jury. So how big and hard was the sausage? Is it the type of weapon you would expect to do serious harm to someone if used as a cudgel?

This question was directed to Lieutenant Ian Burrimond of the Fresno Sheriff&apos;s Department. Lieutenant Burrimond - a man who must have done something VERY bad in his last life to get stuck with this case - was forced to look right into the camera and say that - unfortunately - the sausage was discarded by the suspect as he fled . . . and . . . wait for it . . . wait for it . . . EATEN BY THE VICTIMS&apos;DOG!

That&apos;s right. In the immortal words of Lieutenant Burrimond,&quot;The dog ate the weapon.&quot;

This is, of course, not the best defense ever devised. Any kid who ever tried to explain his failure to produce a homework assignment with the claim that it was eaten by the family dog can attest to the general ineffectiveness of this strategy.

But it&apos;s better than nothing. Those dog-slandering kids didn&apos;t have Lieutenant Burrimond on their witness list. What&apos;s more, they had the burden of proof. Antonio Velasquez doesn&apos;t. He can just sit back and watch the prosecutor herniate trying to push that reasonable doubt boulder up the hill. He&apos;s got at least as good a shot as Ernesto Miranda, and we all know how that turned out. 11 

So let&apos;s hear it for Antonio. Not only did he win this year&apos;s Jimmy Dean Award, he came up with the groundwork for the perfect burglary. Henceforth, anyone contemplating a res burg would be well-advised to take with him an 8-inch sausage and a jar of meat seasoning. Then, if your intended victims awaken or come home, strip to your underwear and start rubbing them with the seasoning, whack&apos;em with the sausage a coupla times, bark like a dog, and break for the door. 12 

Worst case scenario is misdemeanor time. You can do that standing on your head. And if you&apos;re as goofy as Antonio Velasquez, that&apos;s probably exactly how you&apos;ll choose to do it.

 1 Of course, it occurred to Kurt Weill fifty years ago, when he wrote September Song. But don&apos;t go thinking there&apos;s nothing new in the world until you&apos;ve read a little further. 

 2 Let&apos;s face it, between the Veteran&apos;s Day holiday, Thanksgiving, a dozen December holidays, and the week-long bacchanalia that is my birthday, nothing much gets done after you receive the November issue of this magazine. 
 3 Hard to argue with that logic: Terrorists who can read the in-flight magazine are indubitably more dangerous than terrorists who can&apos;t. 
 4 That&apos;s Jeff right over there, jumping off the roof over having been outed as 1/5 of my readership. 
 5 Come to think of it, maybe Jeff jumped off the roof over being outed as a reader of the Fresno Bee. That would be hard for someone living in San Francisco to explain. 
 6 Especially since you can only rub meat seasoning on a sleeping man for a very short time before he ceases to be a sleeping man and becomes a very awake man. I would imagine. 
 7 It is not, for example, something you can say with flowers. Or fruit. And, as near as I can determine, Hallmark hasn&apos;t even tried. 
 8 My original draft said&quot;sausage-battering&quot;but that sounded way too culinary, somehow. It seemed to me to suggest he was getting ready to deep-fry the sausage, which may have been the case, but has not yet been charged. 
 9 Insert your own tasteless joke here. My editor vetoed the three I came up with. 
 10&quot;Allegedly&quot;is, of course, a crucial word here. When you accuse someone of something as serious as sausage crime, you have to be careful to remind readers that he is not a sausage-wielding, seasoning-rubbing weirdo until it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 11 Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U. S. 436. 
 12 The dog barking thing is my own addition. I think the Velasquez Defense just cries out for an insanity plea.

Just Another Day in the Monkey House

When novelist Kurt Vonnegut died last year, Sports Illustrated ran an obituary. This was unusual. SI has a section in which they typically run short obituaries of sports figures, but Kurt Vonnegut was not, at least at first glance, a sports figure. It got my attention.

Turns out Sports Illustrated was running a Vonnegut obituary because Vonnegut was an ex-employee. In 1954, Vonnegut was hired as part of the magazine&apos;s first staff. They had not even begun publishing yet, and Vonnegut was assigned - inter alia - to write a caption for a photograph in the first issue. He was given a photo of a horse who had jumped the rail at Aqueduct Raceway and run through the infield.

According to SI,&quot;Vonnegut pondered the task, typed one sentence and then walked out of his office, never to return.&quot;The one sentence he typed for Sports Illustrated, before going on to write Cat&apos;s Cradle, Slaughterhouse Five, Welcome to the Monkey House, and all the other extraordinary works that made him a major figure in 20th Century American literature?&quot;The horse jumped over the f______ fence.&quot;

That was it. That was all he could come up with. And the unutterable banality of the task and his solution of it, the prospect of coming in to work every day and writing sentences like that one, drove him right out the door.

I&apos;m not sure whether he was demoralized by having to describe something so prosaic or inspired by how easy it had been for the horse to quit his job. Either way, it was nine years before he came back up for air with Cat&apos;s Cradle.

The story comes to mind today because I find myself able to empathize with Vonnegut. I&apos;ve been sitting, staring at the material for this month&apos;s column for most of the evening - getting up every now and again for bathroom breaks and to watch my team bat (1) - and if I could just walk away and write great novels instead, I&apos;d do it.

I&apos;ve got three possibilities here, three news articles from the popular press that I could comment on. The problem is that they have, collectively, caused me to ruminate way too long on the fact I have been writing about stories like this for 25 years and in all that time we don&apos;t seem to have gotten any smarter.

Clearly, evolution is a crock. We&apos;re getting dumber and dumber. Instead of running out of stupid human tricks, we&apos;re coming up with new ones at a rate that defies my ability to keep up. I&apos;ve got three examples here, and all of them make me want to turn in my homo sapiens membership card, pull a Vonnegut, and just jump the f______ fence.

Let&apos;s start with the three good old boys in Memphis who were arrested for stealing a parrot. This seems a fairly pedestrian crime, but their motive raises stupidity to an art form not previously observed outside the White House.

It seems Groucho, Harpo, and Billy-Joe had burglarized a house. While fencing their loot, they decided they&apos;d made a huge mistake in leaving a parrot behind. The parrot had heard them talking, using each other&apos;s names. And since parrots can talk . . . . 

You got it. They went back to steal the parrot for fear it would rat them out . They were loading the parrot into the car when the Memphis police showed up. A car chase ensued, ending when the Beagle Boys (2) crashed their car and the parrot flew away.

You tell me. Does that story make you proud to be a human being, or does it make you want to jump the f______ fence.

Then there&apos;s the guy in London who, according to the Orange County Register , was sentenced to 90 days in jail because he&quot;decapitated a statue of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.&quot;

Guy walked into a museum with a cricket bat under his coat, (3) walked up to the eight-foot statue of Mrs. Thatcher, and started in on his best Vladdy Guerrero imitation. (4) And when the Iron Lady&apos;s statue proved to be as tough as she was, he simply abandoned the cricket bat and&quot;used a heavy metal pole from a crowd barrier to knock off the statue&apos;s gleaming white head.&quot; (5) 

Had he stopped there, he would have gone into stir with my grudging admiration for a somewhat imaginative brand of lunacy. But he had to ruin it by defending on the basis&quot;the act was not criminal damage but‘artistic expression and my right to interact with this broken world&apos;.&quot;

That&apos;s pathetic. Parrots don&apos;t say things that demeaning. Horses don&apos;t say things that disgraceful. Only a human being would sink that low. That&apos;s just a shameful abuse of gray matter. They should have given him 90 days for the decapitation and 90 years for his rationalization of it. Where&apos;s the f______ fence?

But this month&apos;s winner, the one that makes me want to reconsider suicide and alcoholism (6) comes from Norway. There, according to Reuters,&quot;A Norwegian court has acquitted a man accused of raping a sleeping woman after he said he was asleep at the time.&quot;Yep. Acquitted him. Walked him right out the door.

According to Reuters, this poor woman fell asleep on a sofa while her friends were partying all around her. She was fully clothed. She awoke to find herself naked and a man twice her age having sex with her.&quot;The man said he was awakened by her screams for help.&quot;

Well, of course he was. Happens to me all the time. I had to stop sleeping in the nude because I kept waking up in the middle of sex with strange women. (7) 

She&apos;s just lucky she woke him up with her screaming. Obviously the court felt they were sound enough sleepers that they could have been married, had children, and lost all their savings investing in American subprime loans before one of them awoke.

And, to my adamantine astonishment, the Norwegian court, by a vote of 2-1, bought this defense. Honest. They acquitted him.

Bad break for the statue whacker in London. Had he taken out his cosmic disappointment on a statue of King Harald V of Norway, he&apos;d be showering at home today and could pick up the soap without fear.

Reuters - God bless‘em - tried to report this with a straight face. After all, you don&apos;t want a bunch of Norwegian jihadists showing up at your offices complaining you&apos;ve made fun of their judicial system. So they quoted the sleep-raper&apos;s doubtless thoroughly bemused attorney,&quot;‘He said that he was asleep and the majority of the judges found that they could not rule out the possibility,&apos;defense counsel Christian Riig told NRK public radio on Thursday.&quot;

But Reuters just couldn&apos;t leave it at that. Committed as they are to objectivity, they were nonetheless unable to resist adding:&quot;Riig declined to speculate about how the man, who had been drinking, could have had sex in his sleep, apparently after undressing the woman.&quot;

I don&apos;t know, call me a cynic, but I&apos;m betting Riig didn&apos;t want to speculate about that because he could not - because his facial muscles were so exhausted from remaining straight throughout his client&apos;s testimony AND THE RULING OF THE COURT, that he was no longer able to speak. I figure that one sentence about having somehow convinced two judges to buy this poppycock was all he could get out before his quivering lips just refused to function any more. And if you aren&apos;t satisfied by that explanation - if you don&apos;t think the strain of fighting back laughter through all of that could make you unable to utter more than one sentence - let me just point out to you that Reuters suggests the key testimony in the case might have been when&quot;an ex-partner of the man had testified by telephone that similar things had happened to her.&quot;

This, of course, would be why she is an&quot;ex-partner.&quot;I mean, how many times can you put up with sleep-raping without having to put your hands on your hips and call off the jam?

And, of course, this is also why she testified by telephone: She didn&apos;t want anyone to know who the THIRD person in Norway who bought this goofy story was.

Apparently in Norway, if you are too busy to bother coming to court for something as trivial as a rape case, you can just phone it in. And if your testimony is that the defendant has been a chronic sleep-raper for some time, you might want to phone it in from a phone booth, like the kidnappers do.

Since Mr. Riig is unable to speak, and I don&apos;t have the heart to call the poor prosecutor who lost this case (8) , allow me instead to recap for you. Two judges in Norway believed that a drunk guy passed out at a party and awoke when the screams from the passed-out woman he was raping brought him to consciousness. Only then did he realize he had undressed the drunk lady in his sleep and was having sex with her. And this was convincing because his ex-girlfriend CALLED THE COURT and said he used to do the same thing to her (and she knew he was asleep because he told her he was). On that basis, they turned him loose, presumably with an admonition to get a little less sleep.

If that doesn&apos;t make you want to jump the f______ fence, you should read some of Vonnegut&apos;s novels. They&apos;re as plausible as the sleep-raper&apos;s story and as much in touch with reality as the Norwegian court&apos;s ruling.

 Beds Notes: 
 (1) God bless the genius who designed baseball so the good stuff can only happen when your team is up. I get a lot of work done during the opposition&apos;s at bats.
 (2) If you don&apos;t recognize the Beagle Boys as the three villains of the Uncle Scrooge and Donald Duck comic books, you are clearly not a part of my usual demographic; you may want to stop reading right now.
 (3) Gotta admire that.&quot;Metal detector, shmetal detector; until they come up with a cricket bat detector, I can do all the damage I want!&quot;
 (4) And, like Vladdy, was not the least bit deterred by the fact his target was well over his head.
 (5) Memo to public building security teams: The metal detector thing is less effective if you leave large sections of heavy metal pipe accessible inside the building.
 (6) And maybe advocate legislation creating another form of justifiable homicide: people too stupid to live. Texas already has a similar defense:&quot;He needed killing.&quot;
 (7) Some of whom I was married to.
 (8) Or, for that matter, the dissenting judge. My guess is they&apos;re both hip-deep in serious psychotherapy by now.

The Ruby Laffoon Rule

I try really hard not to throw rocks at legislators. For one thing, they have a very tough job, a very boring job, a job most of us wouldn&apos;t take unless they&apos;d stopped hiring at the steel mill. For another thing, if you throw a rock at a legislator, you&apos;re gonna hit him; they&apos;re as defenseless as an animal with opposable thumbs can be. 

Near as I can determine, legislators use up all their instincts for self-preservation during the decennial re-districting process. Having successfully gerrymandered themselves into impregnable wards and boroughs cut and pasted into shapes previously known only to God and Gaudi, they are just plumb tuckered out. Their stores of energy and imagination are so thoroughly depleted that when one of their number comes barreling through the Capitol behind the wheel of one of those zombie Cadillac bad ideas they like so much, it never occurs to them to get out of the way. They just press the aye button and get run down like so many armadillos on a Texas highway.  

It&apos;s pitiful, really, and we shouldn&apos;t be laughing at them when it happens. Making fun of legislators for bad ideas is like kicking cockapoos for being tiny and adorable. 

I know that. But, sadly, while my spirit is willing, my flesh is weak. Try as I might to be nice to these people, they keep serving up column fodder, and I&apos;m just not a good enough person to resist it. 

I would rather not say mean things about them. They do a lot of good, and they set my salary. But hey, I got a deadline coming up in three days. And the folks I&apos;m gonna throw rocks at today have nothing to do with my salary. So another chance to rise above my own base personal interests&quot;gang aft agley.&quot; 1 

This time it&apos;s Kentucky I can&apos;t resist. Which is really too bad. I have a reader in New York 2 who has put together something he calls&quot;The Bedsworth Safety Map.&quot; It shows the United States with a big, red&quot;X&quot;in every state I dare not drive through because I have insulted them in print. Kentucky was my last remaining corridor to the east coast. Sigh. On the other hand, there were only six states left on the east coast I could safely visit, so maybe it&apos;s just as well.

The Kentucky state legislature is currently wrestling with a bill that would make Kentucky Fried Chicken,&quot;The Official Picnic Food of Kentucky.&quot; Seriously. &quot;The Official Picnic Food.&quot; Representative Charles Siler has introduced a bill that would so designate KFC&apos;s&quot;Original Recipe.&quot;

How could anyone expect me not to tee that up? Gandhi couldn&apos;t resist a straight line like that. 3 

Neither can PETA. You remember PETA: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They&apos;re like the Sierra Club for cockapoos. They&apos;re the kind of organization legislators should have to protect them from us rock-throwers.

PETA&apos;s very upset that Kentucky is considering&quot;honoring&quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken. They loathe Kentucky Fried Chicken. If PETA were Iran, they would consider KFC&quot;The Great Satan.&quot; So they&apos;re on Representative Siler like ugly on a bulldog. 

Their position, I think eloquently expressed, is that,&quot;If the state legislature moves forward with this one, then they should change Kentucky&apos;s state bird from the cardinal to the debeaked, crippled, scalded, diseased, dead chicken.&quot; That lovely picture is provided by one Bruce Friedrich, identified by the Lexington Herald-Leader 4 as PETA&apos;s vice president. If I were a state legislator, with my heretofore referenced diminished capacity for self-preservation, I would not want to run afoul 5 of Mr. Friedrich.

But with all due respect to the formidable Mr. Friedrich, I think PETA&apos;s missing the point here. The point is,&quot;How has Kentucky gone 216 years without an official state picnic food?&quot; I mean, I can understand failing to provide health care for its citizens and neglecting the state&apos;s infrastructure and not putting up barbed wire all along its borders to protect its citizens from terrorist hordes swarming down from Ohio like so many Buckeye Visigoths . . . but how could Kentucky&apos;s legislature have shirked its responsibility to designate an official state picnic food?

Now I know what you&apos;re thinking. You&apos;re thinking,&quot;Isn&apos;t the mint julep already the official state picnic food of Kentucky?&quot; Well, apparently not. It isn&apos;t even the official state beverage. Milk is. They decided that in 2005. 6 

They got lots of other official stuff. They got an official state dance (clogging), an official state butterfly (the Viceroy), and an official state locomotive (Old 152). 7  They&apos;ve even got an official state silverware pattern, for crying out loud (Old Kentucky Bluegrass: The Georgetown Pattern) and TWO state mottos (one in English, one in Latin, but they&apos;re different; go figure).

Yet they have NO OFFICIAL STATE PICNIC FOOD. God bless Representative Siler for straightening that out.

Or at least trying to. There is some opposition to Rep. Siler&apos;s bill quite apart from its PETA-antagonizing propensities. The Ashland Daily Independent , for example, has editorialized that the official state picnic food should just be generic, unbranded fried chicken. As it cogently points out,&quot;not all chicken served at picnics in Kentucky is from KFC.&quot; 8 

Which reminds me, didn&apos;t the KFC people become KFC by deleting the words&quot;Kentucky,&quot;&quot;Fried,&quot;and&quot;Chicken&quot;from their corporate moniker? 9  Didn&apos;t they make a corporate decision they did NOT WANT to be identified with Kentucky, fried foods in general and fried chicken in particular? Are these really the people the Kentucky state legislature ought to be honoring? 

If California Pizza Kitchen decided to call itself CPK so it could better market itself to Texans, wouldn&apos;t we be a little offended? I would be. Especially if we&apos;d put a bust of the founder of the company in the state capitol. 

Yep, there is a bust of Harland Sanders in the Kentucky State Capitol building. I know this because I almost wrote about it when Pamela Anderson tried to get the governor to remove the bust a couple of years ago because of her concern about KFC waterboarding chickens. 10  I spent an hour trying to write the column before deciding it was not worth all the effort just for the Pamela Anderson/Colonel Sanders bust/bust double entendres. 11 

So I can certainly understand the feeling of some Kentuckians that they&apos;ve already done enough for a company that jumped ship years ago.

Besides, there are some disturbing questions raised by some of the whereases in Representative Siler&apos;s bill. According to the first whereas , 12 Harland Sanders opened his first restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky 13 in 1930. But according to the third whereas , Colonel Sanders&apos;s&quot;Original Recipe&quot;fried chicken was first cooked in Colonel Sanders&apos;s restaurant in 1940. 

Which means it took ten years for the Colonel to come up with his&quot;Original Recipe?&quot; I&apos;m sorry, that&apos;s a use of the word&quot;original&quot;I - the English major - have a little trouble with. What fried chicken recipe was used for the ten years before the&quot;original&quot;recipe? What was the universe like before the Big Bang? 

If I were Kentucky, I would want answers to these questions before I enshrined that finger lickin&apos;good stuff in my codified statutes forever and ever. 14  Can you imagine how embarrassing it would be to have to stand in Costco parking lots gathering signatures for the initiative to repeal your Official State Picnic Food designation?

But the biggest reason not to name Kentucky Fried Chicken the Official State Picnic Food of Kentucky is found in the second whereas of the resolution in support of it. It says,&quot; Whereas Kentucky Governor Ruby Laffoon made Harland Sanders an honorary Kentucky Colonel in recognition of his contributions to the state&apos;s cuisine in 1936 . . .&quot; 

Governor Ruby Laffoon?!?! That alone should be enough to keep this bill from ever becoming law. It would violate Bedsworth&apos;s Third Law of Statutory Interpretation: No statute that requires an admission the state once elected a man named Ruby Laffoon as its governor can possibly be a real law. Ignore it.

 1  That&apos;s Robert Burns. It&apos;s from&quot;To a Mouse.&quot; The&quot;gang aft agley&quot;part is Scottish dialect for&quot;go oft awry,&quot;which is what the poem tells us happens to&quot;the best laid plans of mice and men.&quot; Every so often, I feel the need to include something for the benefit of those of you who think anybody could write this column - something to make you say,&quot;Oh, jeez, you need to waste three years getting a bachelor&apos;s degree in English to write this drivel? I couldn&apos;t do that; my pain threshold is too low. Maybe I couldn&apos;t write this column.&quot;

 2  Probably only one. We&apos;d have to appoint attorneys for everyone in the state before questioning them to find out if there are more, so let&apos;s just assume there&apos;s only one.

  3 Okay, maybe Gandhi could. Gandhi did not have to fill column space every month.

 4  &quot;Spanning the globe to bring you the constant variety of sport.&quot; Me and ABC&apos;s Wide World of Sports .

 5  Or, in Kentucky&apos;s case, a-fowl.

 6  And wouldn&apos;t you want to hire the lobbyist who was able to get milk declared the official state beverage in the state that invented bourbon?

 7  Hell if I know. It&apos;s a locomotive. What would an English major know about locomotives?

 8  Now there&apos;s an editorial board not afraid of controversy.

 9 Or at least&quot;entucky&quot;&quot;ried&quot;and&quot;hicken.&quot;

 10  At least I think it was waterboarding. I know it was torture of some kind. I tried to double check with the Department of Justice, but they informed me General Mukasey is still working on that one.

 11  And because at that time there were still east coast states I wanted to visit and I was hoping to keep Kentucky open on&quot;The Bedsworth Safety Map.&quot;

 12 This word apparently can only be printed in boldface fonts. I went out and looked at a couple of documents I have that contain whereases , and, sure enough, boldface.

 13 Which, lo and behold, is in Rep. Siler&apos;s district.

 14  Well, at least the first one. Maybe it is asking a little much to expect the Kentucky State Legislature to explain the Big Bang thing. At least right now while they&apos;re gearing up for re-districting.

Schaddenfreude a la Spitzer

My wife and I work together. This means I get to spend pretty much every minute of my life with her. This sometimes gets in the way because, of course, it means I have to spend so much time giving thanks to a higher power for my incredible good fortune. Other than that, it is the unalloyed blessing everyone who knows Kelly imagines it to be. 1 

For one thing, it makes for some terrific conversation on the way to work. One morning in March, for example, we spent the entire 35 minutes talking about then New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and the holocaust he now inhabits.

It was a lively and candid discussion marked by the kind of perceptive sagacity and insightful, evenhanded deliberation you&apos;ve come to expect from your courts of appeal. There were elements of history and moral philosophy and sociology and religion and politics and a fair sprinkling of psychology. There was serious analysis and impressive consensus-building.

The upshot of that discussion? I am not allowed to spend more than $150 on a prostitute.

Part of this is based on the fact that if I hire a prostitute, I will need the rest of my money for a good divorce lawyer and a nice, furnished apartment at the Oakwood Gardens. 2  The rest is based on our agreement that the $4400 ex-Governor Spitzer is alleged to have paid is just way out of line when the math is done conscientiously.

As to this latter point, Kelly and I figure that when you factor in the actual time of usage, the cost of one of the ex-Governor&apos;s prostitutes to me would be approximately $176,000 an hour. Which seems high.

Actually, even $4400 an hour is high when you figure that if I took the entire hour, we&apos;d be spending most of it doing a sudoku and watching an episode of House Hunters (two episodes if we tivoed them and fast-forwarded through the commercials).

Yet somehow the governor of New York, a smart man with a graduate degree, a product of two of the finest universities in the world, a man who has spent almost fifty years on the planet and has proved repeatedly that he can both divide and multiply, considered this a good deal. Even though he was doing it on a greased high-wire suspended over a flaming pit of hungry alligators. 3 

What gets into people? I mean, hiring a prostitute is risky business for even the most anonymous Joe Average. You can be the manager of an auto parts store, faceless to everyone you meet, barely able to get a waitress to come to your table, but you solicit a prostitute and suddenly there will be searchlights and sirens, helicopters and news vans, and your booking photo will be fed-exed to every member of your church congregation. Guaranteed.

Ask any john who&apos;s ever been busted for it. It&apos;s a low percentage play.

But if you hire a prostitute when you&apos;re the governor of the most famous place in the solar system, you go beyond the realm of the bad idea and ascend to the level of transcendental lunacy. For crying out loud, you&apos;re a guy who&apos;s on the six o&apos;clock news every night. You&apos;re being watched and listened to constantly. Everybody knows your face. Your chances of escaping notice are absolutely nil. You&apos;ve gone from a snowball in hell to a snowflake. 4 

And I&apos;m sure the erstwhile governor would identify with the hell metaphor right now.

So it&apos;s time for the Jay Leno question. Remember when English actor Hugh Grant, one of the most attractive and urbane men on the planet, was caught in flagrante backseato with a transvestite prostitute? At the time, he was dating Elizabeth Hurley, a woman so beautiful I would have paid her $4400 to pound on my instep with a claw hammer. 5  So help me, everything about Grant&apos;s transgression was inexplicable.

Well, a few nights later, he appeared on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Leno asked him what I&apos;ve always considered the single best question in the history of television journalism. Leno looked at him for about twenty seconds without saying anything and then asked the question everyone in America wanted asked,&quot;What were you THINKING?&quot; 

And Grant had no answer. He had the grace to admit he had no answer. But he had no answer. 6 

Nor, of course, does Spitzer. 

The talking heads do. Television is already full of pop psychologists trying to explain the inexplicable, trying to find some intellectual explanation for supremely anti-intellectual behavior. According to Slate.com, Dr. Laura tried to blame it on Mrs. Spitzer. Honest.           

Dr. Laura&apos;s theory is&quot;When the wife does not focus in on the needs and the feelings sexually, personally, to make him feel like a man, to make him feel like a success, to make him feel like her hero, he&apos;s very susceptible to the charm of some other woman, making him feel what he needs.&quot; 

This, of course, is absolute rubbish. This might be an explanation for cheating 7 , but we&apos;re not talking about cheating. We&apos;re not talking about falling for another woman&apos;s&quot;charm.&quot;We&apos;re talking about hiring another woman&apos;s body. This isn&apos;t an emotional faux pas, it&apos;s a commercial transaction. Blaming his wife is like blaming the trailer park operator for the tornado.

Others have suggested resort to prostitutes might indicate the governor had some issues with his mother. So now we&apos;re blaming the tornado on the trailer manufacturer. I&apos;m sure that there are dozens of journalists doing background on the governor&apos;s mother even as I write this. Has to be Freudian, right?

No. It doesn&apos;t. It might or might not be Freudian, but it doesn&apos;t have to be anything - except stupid.

You want someone to blame? Blame the tornado.

You want an explanation? Here&apos;s an explanation: My gender does stupid things.

Spectacularly stupid things.

Sure, the other gender does stupid things, too. But they seem to lack my gender&apos;s sublime capacity for the sex-driven, complete double-twisting, triple axel,&quot;Look, Ma, both hands behind my back,&quot;flaming, somersaulting, breaking-every-bone-and-crushing-your-spleen catastrophe.

Exhibits A&amp;B: Messrs. Grant and Spitzer. Exhibits C, D, E&amp;F: Charlie Sheen, Eddie Murphy, Rob Lowe, Dodger pitcher Dave Stewart. 8  Exhibit G: My own experience AS A PROSECUTOR. 9 

Having spent fifteen years in the district attorney&apos;s office, I can vouch for the fact prostitution gives prosecutors fits. It&apos;s a misdemeanor, but it&apos;s one of those third rail misdemeanors. Legally, it&apos;s a 30 watt misdemeanor; politically, it&apos;s a 20,000 volt exposed wire.

The offenders are usually sad, often sympathetic, waifs eking out a miserable substitute for a living by pitilessly demeaning themselves. 10  But the voters seem to have an interest in their punishment that far outstrips the crime. They&apos;ll go to church and pray for them on Sunday, but on Tuesday, in the voting booth, they&apos;ll crucify any prosecutor perceived as not throwing the trick book at them. The result is and always has been prosecutorial schizophrenia.

My first job as a lawyer was prosecuting misdemeanors for a great district attorney named Cecil Hicks. 11  Cecil had a rule: Prostitutes go to jail. End of story, end of discussion, end of inquiry. No prostitution case could be dealt for a fine or community service 12 or anything else. Prostitutes had to go to jail.

It wasn&apos;t that Cecil was a rigid moralist. We weren&apos;t working for Elmer Gantry. As far as I know, he didn&apos;t consider the crime itself any more reprehensible than the dozens of other misdemeanors he did allow his deputies to plead out for less than jail time. But he was convinced prostitution would be a perfect entrée into the county for organized crime, and he was determined to keep organized crime out of Orange County. So prostitutes did jail time.

I don&apos;t know if he was right. But I know prostitutes would plead to almost anything in Los Angeles County if they could get the judge to wrap up their Orange County cases as part of the deal. Fines were merely a cost of doing business for them, but jail time was hugely counterproductive.

And I know there is virtually no organized crime presence in Orange County today. 13  And Cecil Hicks could be elected District Attorney tomorrow if he were still alive. Which puts him considerably ahead of Governor Spitzer on at least four fronts. 

First, Cecil, rest his soul, is dead. Spitzer only wishes he were.

Second, even dead, Cecil is more electable right now than Spitzer.

Third, Cecil is buried. Spitzer will be radioactive for a thousand years; they&apos;ll have to launch his body into space in a lead-lined trash barrel.

And fourth, everybody I&apos;ve ever talked to about Cecil Hicks respected him as a prosecutor and remembers him as a good and decent, fair and honorable man. Everyone has a Cecil Hicks story, and they all involve laughter. But even if you spend the rest of the week trying, you will be unable to find anyone who remembers ever sharing a meal with Eliot Spitzer.

So what does this have to do with you? I hope nothing. I hope you didn&apos;t need to be reminded of any of this. But, like all cautionary tales, it has an audience - often one that nobody suspects. Maybe you&apos;re it.

But even if you&apos;re not, there&apos;s a definite bright side to this for you. Ours is a stressful profession. Sometimes it flat out beats us up. You may have had a day like that today... or a week... or more. You may have lost a summary judgment motion... or a trial... or a witness... or a partnership. You may be headed home right now with your head down.

But take heart. No matter how bad your day was. No matter how bad your week, your month, your year... it&apos;s better than Eliot Spitzer&apos;s. 

Count your blessings.
And kiss your spouse.
 

 1. Did I mention Kelly reads every column?

 2. Assuming, that is, that my needs cannot be met quite nicely by the nearest available funeral home.

 3. Yeah, that&apos;s a bad deal for the alligators, but an even worse one for Spitzer.

 4. The operative word here being&quot;flake.&quot;

 5. Now, of course, my limit would be $150.

 6. He also had no Elizabeth Hurley. Ever again.

 7. Or it might not be.

 8. And that list, I&apos;m embarrassed to admit, took only three minutes and no resort to the internet to compile.

 9. I thought that phrase needed to be shouted in case a train happened to be going by when my wife read it.

 10. Governor Spitzer&apos;s associates in The Emperor&apos;s Club notwithstanding, prostitutes are the stoop laborers of crime (no pun intended).

 11.&quot;I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.&quot;And, like Hamlet&apos;s Yorick, he carried me on his back until I gradually turned into a lawyer.

 12. They were already servicing the community; that&apos;s what got them in trouble.

 13. There are also very few elephants - a fact I attribute to Cecil&apos;s&quot;Elephants Go to Prison&quot;rule.

Gorilla Warfare

I must admit I was startled. I had not expected to see a gorilla when I left the golf course. And I certainly hadn&apos;t expected to be within 20 feet of one. 1 Yet there he was, standing on a street corner in Irvine, swaying rhythmically from side to side, listening to his iPod.

He was holding a large, arrow-shaped yellow sign that said,&quot;Homes for Sale.&quot;At the risk of sounding anthropomorphic, I had the distinct impression he was smiling, despite the stultifying boredom of standing on a street corner for hours on end waggling a large yellow arrow. I assume he was either an illegal gorilla or had fallen on hard times, since this is precisely the kind of work I&apos;m told we need gorillas to do because humans won&apos;t. 2 

I watched him until the signal changed. The whole concept of this kind of advertising eludes me. I mean, it&apos;s not like seeing a gorilla with a big yellow arrow is likely to remind me that I meant to buy a home while I was out.&quot;Oh, that&apos;s right; Kelly wanted me to stop and pick up a new home after I finished golfing. What a break: This guy&apos;s got some!&quot;

And even if I were the one guy in a million who would roll down his window and enter into negotiations with a gorilla, nobody ever goes through with those purchases. Sure, people will talk to a gorilla about a new house, people will act like they&apos;re interested in what the gorilla has to sell, but our society is still way too specist for anyone to ever close the deal. I talked to three different real estate boards and none of them is aware of a single home sale by a gorilla last year. 3 

Apparently large-animal-with-arrow-sign advertising works in other areas of marketing. I know this because it is generating more litigation nationwide than the Americans with Disabilities Act. Judging from the number of lawsuits reported in the popular press, people find large-animal-with-arrow-sign advertising almost as offensive as sexy-women-without-clothes-on dancing.

It seems a lot of places consider the arrow the key part of the act and consider it a violation of their sign ordinances. This seems to me to completely miss the truly remarkable significance of employing a gorilla. I&apos;m afraid most municipalities have focused way too much on signage and way too little on underemployed species. And, of course, the result of such short-sightedness is always tragic.

In Woodland Park, Colorado, for example, a rare giant chicken has been ordered to stop walking along Highway 24 brandishing a sign urging passersby to eat at Wild Wings‘n Things. 4 The City Manager says the chicken 5 violated the city&apos;s sign ordinance and threatened Woodland Park&apos;s&quot;mountain grandeur.&quot;

As I understand it, the ordinance in question says nothing about&quot;mascot signage,&quot;but includes a provision that&quot;All signs not expressly permitted or exempted from this regulation are specifically prohibited.&quot; Since there is nothing in the ordinance about giant chickens . . . well, you went to law school; construct your own syllogism here. And while you&apos;re at it, construct a new sign ordinance for Woodland Park; the one they&apos;ve got sucks.

While the Colorado Springs Gazette does not explain why PETA is not holding torchlight parades over this injustice, it does quote several townspeople who recognize the shortsightedness of the City Manager&apos;s decision. My favorite is,&quot;It&apos;s a funky town; he&apos;s a funky chicken.&quot;This is the kind of straightforward, cohesive logic I strive for every day. 6 

Eleven hundred townspeople have signed a petition to save the Wings‘n Things 7 chicken, who, for reasons I cannot explain other than by reference to the townspeople&apos;s affection for him, is referred to as The Chicken Man. I thought at first that might mean he wasn&apos;t a REAL chicken. But the owner of Wings‘n Things is quoted as explaining the chicken&apos;s silence by pointing out,&quot;He does not talk; he&apos;s a chicken,&quot;so I know that&apos;s not it.

And it probably wouldn&apos;t matter if it were. There seems to be resistance to this kind of advertising no matter who does it. According to my friend Kevin Underhill, who writes Loweringthebar.net,&quot;Police in Searcy, Arkansas, have no leads in repeated attacks against Steven Turnage, who wears a chicken suit on local city streets to promote a fast-food restaurant.&quot; Someone went so far as to shoot bottle rockets at that poor guy, setting his chicken suit on fire. 8 

In McHenry, Illinois, they banned a woman who dressed as the Statue of Liberty to promote a tax-preparer. Then they decommissioned a guy who dressed as a mattress to remind people their wife told them to pick up a mattress on the way home after they bought the new house and picked up the chicken wings. 9 

You know how Robert Frost said,&quot;Something there is that does not love a wall&quot;? Well, whatever that something is, it has nothing on the forces of the universe that converge against mascot advertising.

Take New Jersey. Please. 10 

According to the Associated Press,&quot;The New Jersey State Supreme Court [will decide] whether a town can ban a 20-foot inflatable rat.&quot;Honest.

Apparently some unreported natural disaster wiped out all the trial courts in New Jersey. Why else would their Supreme Court be deciding issues like this?

Seems the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers decided the best way to draw attention to their grievances against Gold&apos;s Gym was to post a 20-foot inflatable rat outside the gym. While the significance of that might not have been readily apparent in Newport Beach or Villa Park, it was clear in New Jersey. According to the New Jersey Appellate Division&apos;s opinion, a rat&quot;is a well-known symbol of protesting unfair labor practices.&quot; 11 

Anyway, the IBEW was ordered to take down the rat on the ground it violated a local sign ordinance that prohibited&quot;balloon signs or other inflated signs (excepting grand opening signs).&quot;They did, but when they put it back up 45 minutes later 12 , union official Wayne DeAngelo was cited.

He was convicted of violating the ordinance and fined $133. He appealed. The state appellate court ruled against him, BUT THERE WAS A DISSENT. Sing hallelujah, brothers and sisters, there was a dissent!

The dissenting judge pointed out the possibility of unequal treatment of similarly situated 20-foot inflatable rats. Relying on the statute&apos;s exception for grand openings, he expressed concern that had a new Disney store opened up right next to Gold&apos;s Gym, it could have displayed an identical rat right next door, to advertise the Disney film&quot;Ratatouille,&quot;while the IBEW&apos;s rat was being hauled off to the pokey. 13 That&apos;s trouble with a capital&quot;T&quot;and that rhymes with&quot;D&quot;and that starts&quot;Dissent.&quot;

This is important because there is an AUTOMATIC right of appeal to the state Supreme Court in any case in which a dissent is filed. Mr. DeAngelo is champing at the bit. His lawyer says of the upcoming appearance before the Supreme Court:&quot;That&apos;s the silver lining.&quot;

I dunno. I have a feeling the state Supreme Court may not be that thrilled about hearing a $133 inflatable rat case. They may wonder why the IBEW didn&apos;t just paint&quot;GRAND OPENING&quot;on their rat and save them a lot of trouble. Appellate counsel might be well-advised to forget the silver lining and see about getting one made of asbestos for his suit. 

Fortunately, our own Supreme Court&apos;s docket will not be similarly sullied. 14 The 9th Circuit ruled in Ballen v. City of Redmond (2006) 466 F.3d. 736, that the Blazing Bagels bagel shop could have an employee stand outside with a sign urging people to come in and buy bagels. Seems to me a shop that describes their bagels as&quot;blazing&quot;might be better off if they sent an employee outside with a gun to steer people into the store; a sign might not be enough.

But that wasn&apos;t the issue. The issue was whether Redmond&apos;s sign ordinance restricting purely commercial speech was drawn narrowly enough to pass constitutional muster. 15 The Ninth Circuit said it was not.

I could spend several more paragraphs explaining why Redmond&apos;s ordinance was flawed, but if I did, you&apos;d stop reading. I have not a clue why you&apos;ve read this far, but I&apos;m reasonably certain it wasn&apos;t for scholarly exposition of recent Ninth Circuit cases.

All you need to know about the Redmond case is that the court awarded the flaming bagel guy fees and costs and the City of Redmond ended up out of pocket $165,508. Now I don&apos;t know how much disposable cash the City of Redmond has jingling around in its figurative jeans, but I&apos;m pretty sure the next time they take umbrage over a sign, they&apos;ll be a tad more reluctant to make a federal case out of it.

And I&apos;m pretty sure all the City Managers in California know about the Blazing Bagels Case. I can&apos;t see them advising their clients to risk $165,508 over a sign unless it&apos;s pretty obnoxious.
And, say what you will about them, gorillas are not obnoxious.
 
 1. I&apos;m pretty sure of the distance between us because I had three-putted it several times in the previous five hours.
 2. Apparently, we are the only primates frightened by the prospect of&quot;dehumanizing work.&quot;

 3. Perhaps&quot;talked to&quot;is a bit of an exaggeration, since no one said a single word to me after I asked the question. But I think three hang-ups in three calls are enough to establish a negative response.

 4. Shouldn&apos;t there be a second apostrophe after the&quot;n,&quot;as in&quot;Wild Wings‘n&apos;Things? After all, we&apos;re apostrophizing both the&quot;a&quot;and the&quot;d&quot;. That&apos;s the kind of problem MY sign ordinance would address. Give thanks I&apos;m not on YOUR city council.

 5. Obviously a free-range chicken.

 6. And, according to many, achieve.

 7. I&apos;m still bugged by that missing second apostrophe. Do you think maybe they only need one because what they were going for was Wings On Things?

 8. Let&apos;s just hope no one does that to real chickens, like the one in Woodland Park.

 9. Wings IN Things?

 10. Henny Youngman, gone but not forgotten.

 11. See how much we miss out here on the left coast?

 12. Somewhere is a union lawyer who can lay claim to one of the most unusual billable hours in history: &quot;Research and analysis re propriety of rat display.&quot;

 13. Appellate work appeals to a very special kind of individual.

 14. Actually, I have nothing against the rat case, but I couldn&apos;t pass up a chance to use a phrase like&quot;similarly sullied.&quot; I just know I&apos;m not gonna get that chance in an opinion.

 15. Please pass the muster; my hot dog&apos;s getting cold.

The Korean Alien Penumbra Conundrum

On October 5th of last year, I spoke to the American Bar Association&apos;s International Law Section in London. On October 19th, I spoke to the Nebraska State Bar Convention in Lincoln.

In between, I spent a week in a decompression chamber to keep from getting the bends.

I had a great time in both venues. I officiated two NHL games in London and took in the Nebraska-Texas A&amp;M football game in Lincoln. I was a pig in slop.

In many ways, the two experiences were much the same. In London, I had great food (I could live for a long time on steak and ale pie, and they do nice things with venison) and went to the British Museum, where I saw some of the Chinese terra cotta soldiers on exhibit. In Lincoln, I had great food (you are not allowed to leave Memorial Stadium without eating at least one runza( 1 ) and went to the National Museum of Roller Skating where I saw&quot;the colorful history and the promising future of one of America&apos;s favorite sports.&quot;( 2 ) In both places I met really nice people.

So, as you can see, there is not much to choose between these two places except that London has part of an ocean protecting it from the maniacal French, while Nebraska is chockablock next to the maniacal Kansans and you pretty much live in constant fear that they might pour across the border at any moment and take your science textbooks away from you. Other than that, I think you could have a great weekend in either place.

But I must admit I&apos;m starting to think Nebraska, even given its terrifying juxtaposition with the newest state in the Union,( 3 ) might be a safer bet than England. In fact, I&apos;m starting to distrust any place that requires me to fly over a larger body of water than the Great Salt Lake.

So help me, folks, at the risk of sounding chauvinistic,( 4 ) I&apos;m starting to think governments in the rest of the world are smoking even more weed than ours is.

Let&apos;s start with the Brits. According to Reuters, a panel made up of&quot;three of Britain&apos;s most senior judges&quot;has discovered an inalienable human right not to live in France. Imagine. Eight hundred years since the Magna Carta and nobody in Britain had previously noticed that there was this innate human right lying around. Remarkable.

This will be an interesting precedent - especially for people like my wife, who tends to develop strong feelings about places we visit.( 5 ) And employment lawyers will be especially interested in this case when the head office orders their client transferred from Newport Beach to Burundi.( 6 )

The Brits detected this inalienable right during a family law case. You knew it would be family law, didn&apos;t you. Family law makes everybody crazy.

Seems British dad and French mom split up. Mom took their two sons, ages 11 and 16, with her to France. But after a visit with Dad in England, the boys refused to return to France, on the basis that in England they could&quot;walk to school, could have their own key and would not have to do as much homework.&quot;( 7 )

The court, citing the boys&apos;&quot;Britishness&quot;( 8 ), said they had&quot;an inherent right to refuse to live in France.&quot;It&apos;s not exactly&quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,&quot;or even&quot;Liberte, egalite, fraternite,&quot;but it&apos;s the first inherent human right discovered since Justice Douglas wandered into a penumbra while on a camping trip in 1965 and wrote about it in Griswold v. Connecticut, so it&apos;s nothing to be sneezed at.

Inalienable human rights don&apos;t pop up every day. I really think it should have gotten a lot more attention from the legal press than it did.

Probably, though, it was overshadowed by the decision of the South Korean Court of Appeals to suspend a prison sentence on the basis that the defendant was too important to the national economy to be locked up for three years. That&apos;s right. Go back and read it again. It says exactly what you think it says. He was too important to do the time.

Chung Mong-koo, the 69-year-old Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company, was convicted of embezzling $100 million from his company. For this he was sentenced to three years in prison.( 9 ) But the appellate court suspended his sentence ON THE BASIS HE WAS TOO IMPORTANT TO GO TO JAIL.( 10 )

Honest. According to the Los Angeles Times, quoting the Associated Press, two organizations not on the list of the world&apos;s largest importers of hallucinogenic drugs,&quot;In reversing Chung&apos;s sentence, presiding Judge Lee Jae-hong told a packed courtroom in Seoul,‘I was unwilling to engage in a gamble that would put the nation&apos;s economy at risk.&apos;&quot;

And they&apos;re clearly right. I mean, I saw a picture of him and he had a tie on and everything. He sure looked important to me. And there were a bunch of people shoving microphones in his face like he was announcing the discovery of a cure for psoriasis - or a newly discovered inherent human right.

Which, come to think of it, he was. He was announcing the right to do whatever you damn well please if you&apos;re really rich and live in Korea. It&apos;s a lot like Britishness only it comes with a get-out-of-jail-free card instead of a get-out-of-France-free card.

Nor is this some kind of bizarre fluke. According to the Times,&quot;Chey Tae-won, the chairman of another conglomerate, energy giant SK Corp., had his three-year prison sentence suspended by an appeals court last year after he was convicted of fraud.&quot; In fact, the Times says 83% of suspects in embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty cases have been set free by South Korean courts since 2001. Keep that in mind next time you feel like griping about American courts being soft on crime.

But as bad as these two are, the one that really worries me is the Italian decision that space aliens are testing secret weapons in Sicily. According to The Week, Sicilian villagers in Canneto di Caronia had reported that refrigerators and toasters and things have been spontaneously bursting into flames in their town. The Italian government investigated and concluded that&quot;aliens testing secret weapons&quot;are probably responsible.

I just don&apos;t know what to add to that. How can you read that and not think that maybe you want to postpone your trip to Venice for a year or two?( 11 )

Here is what the Malaysia Sun( 12 ) had to say about it:&quot;Dozens of experts, including a scientist from the US space agency NASA, were sent to investigate the bizarre blazes, in a two-year probe which cost the exchequer a whopping one million pounds. Now a leaked Italian report has said that aliens were a likely cause of the fires in the remote village of Canneto de Caronia in Sicily.&quot;

Makes Lincoln, Nebraska look pretty good to you, doesn&apos;t it?

Just be sure to approach Lincoln from the north or the west. You don&apos;t wanna come in through Kansas. They&apos;ll arrest you on suspicion of being a biologist and you&apos;ll have to invoke your inalienable human right to rip off Koreans in France.( 13 )

 1. This is a beef and cabbage pie, not all that unlike the British pasties, only surrounded by screaming people wearing red.

 2. Not to mention a gasoline-powered roller skate (you gotta go to their website and see this bad boy ( http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/ ), although, as you can imagine, it&apos;s much more impressive in person).

 3. This would be Kansas. True, they were admitted to the Union in 1861, but according to their school system, they were created only 6,000 years ago, which makes them much newer than any of the other states.

 4. In the original sense of the term. Nicolas Chauvin. &quot;My country right or wrong.&quot; That kinda thing.

 5. Kelly cannot understand, for example, how Houston, Texas, can be anything but a penal colony.

 6. Or Houston.

 7. Considerations which have inexplicably not made their way into any reported California custody cases.

 8. I&apos;m guessing this was established either by sophisticated DNA analysis or the fact the boys found Benny Hill funny, which is not possible for anyone who is not British.

 9. As I understand the South Korean sentencing system, embezzlement of less than the gross national product of Gambia, the maximum punishment is three years. Chung just made it under the wire.

 10. I don&apos;t resort to all-caps often, but this seemed to be a clause that merited them. In the first place, they gave him only 3 years for embezzling $100 million. Let me go on the record right here: For $100 million, I would go to prison for three years tomorrow. That isn&apos;t a sentence, it&apos;s a power forward&apos;s contract demand. But then they decided he didn&apos;t have to go to prison AT ALL because THEY SAID HE WAS TOO IMPORTANT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! That&apos;s all caps stuff, if you ask me.

 11. Don&apos;t do it. Don&apos;t EVER postpone a trip to Venice.

 12. Yeah, I know, not exactly the New York Times, but probably a lot more reliable than Fox News. What can I tell you? Except for The Week, very few mainstream news organizations covered this. Nobody wants to report on a major world government going absolutely loonytunes. It&apos;s too disturbing.

 13. No, it doesn&apos;t make sense, but if you say it loud, it may confuse them long enough for you to hightail it across the border into Nebraska. Nice people in Nebraska. Wear red.

Heir of the Dog

I had three dogs as a boy. All were named Trouble. This was because my dad named all the dogs and he was not entirely convinced by my mom&apos;s&quot;A boy should have a dog&quot;argument.

In fact, Dad disliked pretty much everything about dogs. And cats. And ferrets and hamsters and birds and... well, let&apos;s just say the concept of pets was one Dad never fully bought into. He was not only a flaming specist, he was a little paranoid about it: He seemed convinced all the planet&apos;s small animals were in league against him, and hell bent on his personal aggravation.

The whole time I was growing up, I was not allowed to own a bb gun. But Dad always had one with which he threatened to shoot any bird, cat or neighborhood child who strayed into his backyard. 1  Mostly he just threatened, mainly because Mom usually responded by threatening to leave him if he ever actually shot anything.

So Dad spent a lot of his leisure time, of which there was very little 2 , mumbling under his breath about Mrs. Adams&apos;cat or Mr. Chavez&apos;parrot or Mr. Ortlieb&apos;s&quot;yapping throw dog.&quot; 3  And my brother and I spent a great deal of time trying to make sure none of the Troubles - or any of the neighbors&apos;pets or children - got underfoot. 4 

We were the only people I knew whose dog was named Trouble. And we were the only people I&apos;ve ever known whose dogs all had the same name. Dad didn&apos;t say much, but he certainly knew how to make a point.

So you can imagine how shocked I was to learn that another Trouble had shown up on the national news. It turns out the late Leona Helmsley&apos;s dog is named Trouble. And she&apos;s got some.

This Trouble is an 8-year-old Maltese, a killer cute little white throw dog. She lives on the late Ms. Helmsley&apos;s Connecticut estate, the only occupant of the 28-room mansion other than the servants. I don&apos;t know how many servants Trouble has, but I shouldn&apos;t think she has much trouble finding good help, what with the $12 million her late mistress left her when she passed into the celestial Land of Milk and Money.

That&apos;s right. TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. Trouble&apos;s owner 5 left her twelve million dollars. You wouldn&apos;t think a dog with twelve million dollars would have any... well... troubles, but this one does.

This might be a good time to discuss Trouble&apos;s owner. Tough call for me here: Which is the reader more likely to want more information about right now: multi-millionaire dog or looneytoon owner? Let&apos;s go with looneytoon owner.

You may be old enough to remember Leona Helmsley. 6  She was a real estate mogul. Her ruthless business methods, including some fairly heartless evictions, earned her the nickname,&quot;The Queen of Mean&quot;back in the seventies. In 1987, when she was convicted of tax evasion, one of her housekeepers testified she had once said,&quot;We don&apos;t pay taxes; the little people pay taxes.&quot;

With that attitude, it&apos;s not surprising she seems to have been one of those people who inspires unanimity of opinion. No one had a good word for her. You know how some people you might cross the street to avoid talking to? Well, Leona Helmsley would make a train take a dirt road.

All of which apparently worked really well for her. She was seriously rich. The 12 million the dog got was chump change. She was worth something like five billion dollars. Five billion. That&apos;s the number five followed by a parade of zeroes and commas and floats and marching bands.

She once owned the Empire State Building, for crying out loud. That&apos;s rich.

And she seems to have been the opposite of my dad. While Dad was perpetually plotting the imminent demise of the next sparrow he saw, he loved people. Leona Helmsley left twelve million dollars to her dog and disinherited two of her grandchildren. Completely. She said they would&quot;know why.&quot;

True, she left her brother 15 million, but it was conditioned on him taking care of the dog! Honest!

That&apos;s why I say Trouble has trouble: The brother says he won&apos;t do it. According to the Associated Press,&quot;The New York Post, citing an unidentified source, reported that [her brother, Alvin] Rosenthal, 80, expressed no interest in caring for Trouble. Whether her grandson David Panzirer, Helmsley&apos;s second choice, would step in was not known.&quot;

David might want to give this some serious thought. True, he was not one of the disinherited grandchildren. He got five million. But the five million is conditioned on him visiting his father&apos;s grave at least once every year. 7  A chance to triple your money by spooning some kibble into a dish twice a day might be a pretty sweet deal. 8  Especially since Trouble is gonna be pushing a hundred in dog years by 2013. It&apos;s not like he has to marry J. Howard Marshall, 9 he just has to walk the dog.

But it&apos;s not all sunshine and chewbones. Ms. Helmsley&apos;s will specified that when Trouble passes on to the Big Dog Park in the Sky, her earthly remains are to be buried with Ms. Helmsley. That would be fine, except that New York law does not allow animals to be buried in human cemeteries. 10  So a big chunk of Trouble&apos;s money figures to go to the lawyers - and or legislators - hired to fix that little snafu.

And a lot more will probably have to go to the lawyers charged with defending Trouble in the civil suit. That&apos;s right, Trouble is being sued. David might want to consider whether he really wants to buy a Maltese that comes with a leash, a collar, a bowl, several servants, and two lawsuits. Maybe a nice golden retriever would be a better choice.

Seems one of Helmsley&apos;s former housekeepers claims Trouble often bit her during her three-month job with the billionaire, and she wants a chunk of Trouble&apos;s inheritance to assuage her pain and suffering. According to the AP,&quot;Amfira Sfara, 48, had sued her employer in 2004 over one of those bites, but lost the case when a judge ruled Helmsley was protected from liability under the Worker&apos;s Compensation Law.&quot;

Now Amira&apos;s son, Remus Pop, says his mother is entitled to a big bite of that 12 million dollars. Remus Pop? The woman&apos;s son is named Remus Pop? Who&apos;s writing this story, Charles Dickens? 11 

According to AP, Remus says,&quot;That dog got money. That money is going to be taken away from that dog.&quot; Frankly, it sounds like Remus and Leona would have gotten along famously. What a shame they ended up on opposite sides of this dispute.

Okay, class, let&apos;s review. Housekeeper sues multibillionaire over dog bites. Gets thrown out of civil court into worker&apos;s comp arena. Now dog has more money than the entire New York Worker&apos;s Comp system, so housekeeper is suing dog directly (and the trust set up for the dog). Remus Pop is on the case. Discuss the following issues: Liability, assumption of the risk, agency, res judicata and/or collateral estoppel, trust liability for torts committed by a beneficiary before it was formed, federal diversity jurisdiction, 12 computation of punitive damages against a dog, name change for Remus Pop, and whether the points and authorities for your demurrer should say more than,&quot;Gimme a break, Judge; it&apos;s a DOG!&quot;

Get that into me in two weeks. I won&apos;t be here for next week&apos;s class. I have to spend that time researching pedigrees. I have to figure out whether any of my Troubles were related to Leona&apos;s. I mean, it IS an unusual name.

 
 1 It wasn&apos;t that he had anything against the neighborhood children; it was just that cats and birds required that he shoot fast, and his target acquisition software was pretty primitive. If it was small and moving, it was a target.
 2 In fairness to Dad, he worked 70 hours a week at two jobs; there wasn&apos;t much time to cuddle with the Troubles, or throw sticks for them to chase. He missed out on the good parts of pet ownership.

 3 Dad felt the only thing Mr. Ortlieb&apos;s Pekingese was good for was to&quot;throw at any burglar who breaks in.&quot; Hence,&quot;throw dog.&quot;

 4 As near as we could determine, Dad was all talk, but it was pretty scary talk.

 5 Yeah, I know that term has fallen out of favor in some quarters. The PETA people say it&apos;s smacks of interspecies slavery. But the alternative seemed to me to be&quot;mistress&quot;and I&apos;m pretty sure Ms. Helmsley, who was 87 when she died last month, would not like being referred to as anybody&apos;s mistress.

 6 Fortunately for you, that is NOT one of the questions on the MCLE quiz that follows this column.

 7 Didn&apos;t I see this movie? It&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve and millionaire playboy grandson is out partying when he suddenly realizes he has to get to the cemetery before midnight or he&apos;ll lose all his money, and goes racing through Manhattan only to trip over a small white Maltese and have to crawl the last hundred yards with the assistance of the good-hearted cocktail waitress who doesn&apos;t know he&apos;s rich? Dudley Moore and Goldie Hawn, right? 1985 or thereabouts?

 8 It certainly makes me want to re-negotiate the agreement I have with my cats.

 9 Don&apos;t know the name? Neither did I, which is amazing because he was almost as rich as Leona Helmsley. Do what I did: Google Anna Nicole Smith.

 10 How do we get laws like that? What&apos;s the constituency for&quot;no dead dogs in the human cemeteries&quot;laws? Other than my father, that is.

 11 Who plays Remus Pop in the movie? Snoop Dogg? I mean, there&apos;s gotta be a part for him somewhere, right?

 12 Did I mention Trouble is not a citizen?

Railroaded

My first year criminal law class spent very little time on the elements of crimes and a lot on the&quot;philosophy of punishment.&quot;I griped about the curriculum and complained that we should spend less time studying the music of the spheres and more time learning how to distinguish battery from bottomry. 1    I was twenty and knew a lot.

Forty years later, I know considerably less - a fact you may previously have had the occasion to remark upon. I&apos;ve learned how tough it can be to figure out the elements of crimes (See, e. g., People v. Williams (2001) 26 Cal. 4th 779 [arcane mysteries of assault]; People v. Hobbs (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 1 [wrestling with what crime is committed by surreptitious videotaping of girls&apos;locker room]), and I&apos;ve also - reluctantly - come to the conclusion humans are very bad at figuring out appropriate punishment for transgressions. 

It begins to appear to me that we should be spending a lot more time on the&quot;philosophy of punishment. 2 

Take Amtrak. 3 Amtrak&apos;s true name is the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. It is wholly owned by the federal government. 4 Its directors are appointed by the President of the United States, which probably explains why it feels the necessity to operate under a pseudonym, but I think you have to give them some credit for coming up with the portmanteau&quot;Amtrak&quot;as the pseudonym. After all, they correctly divined that no one would entrust their vacation to an outfit whose acronym was&quot;Nerpsie.&quot;As railroad names go,&quot;Amtrak&quot;has a lot more panache than Short Line or B&amp;O. 5 

And my own experiences with Amtrak have generally been favorable. They&apos;re not as good as the Canadian railroads I&apos;ve traveled, but, hey... they don&apos;t have Gordon Lightfoot. That gives the Canucks a big advantage. Take Vlad Guerrero out of the Angel lineup and they wouldn&apos;t be as good as a Canadian railroad either.

The only other railroads I have personal experience with are the French and the Spanish, and I wouldn&apos;t trust either of them to get me to Bakersfield, so I&apos;m reluctant to criticize Amtrak.

But their philosophy of punishment needs some work. Just ask Roosevelt Sims.

Mr. Sims retired from his factory job in June at the age of 65. He decided to take a train trip to Los Angeles to celebrate.

This is hard for me to understand. L.A. is my home town, and I will always feel a certain allegiance to it, but it&apos;s hard for me to understand someone in St. Louis wanting to come here on a vacation. I think L.A. is like a bad magician: the farther away you are, the better the act looks to you.

Anyway, for whatever reason, Mr. Sims decided to take a train to L. A. But, a few hundred miles from his destination, near Williams, Arizona, railroad personnel took it into their collective head that he was drunk. So they put him off the train. 

In a forest. In the middle of nowhere. 6 In the middle of the night.

They threw a 65-year old man they thought was drunk off the train and into a pine forest, at 8,000 feet elevation, five miles from the nearest town and eight hours before daylight. There was no water where they left him and the nearest road was two miles away. 

That strike you as over-reaction? 

Does me.

In fact, Mr. Sims&apos;family says he is a non-drinker and was in fact not drunk, but going into diabetic shock. If they&apos;re correct, Amtrak&apos;s response makes Molokai look positively enlightened.

Somebody at Amtrak was not paying attention during Philosophy of Punishment 101. The punishment for drunkenness is not being marooned on a desert island or dropped on Denali without shoes. It is a fine. 7 We save the burial in anthill punishments for more severe infractions.

Mr. Sims is 65 years old. As I approach 60 myself, I&apos;m a lot more willing to see 65 as the new 45, but I don&apos;t know too many 45 year olds I&apos;d expect to do well drunk at night in a national forest. 8 

In my own case, dropping me five miles from Williams with no road and nothing to guide me but a quarter moon would be a death penalty whose disproportionality I would expect Amnesty International to complain about unless I had murdered a family of missionaries.

I mean, the guy is 65 years old. It&apos;s not like he&apos;s gonna overpower the train personnel and attack the engineer. It&apos;s not like they found him with a bomb and they&apos;re afraid he might have confederates in the club car. They couldn&apos;t have waited until there was a town? 

How about this? You put him into an empty compartment, station a conductor there to keep him from leaving, and call ahead to the next town to have the sheriff take him into custody. The guy&apos;s a drunk, for crying out loud. 9 My 20-year old daughter can handle an obnoxious drunk, and she doesn&apos;t weigh 120 pounds soaking wet. 

I mean, this isn&apos;t the Trans-Siberia Express; you&apos;re not gonna have to wait until Tuesday for another town to come up. Williams was only five miles away when they dumped him. You telling me they didn&apos;t have anybody who could handle this man for the 10 minutes it was gonna take to get to Williams?

Yeah, it&apos;s more bother - and probably less entertaining for the train staff - holding onto him than it is putting him off two miles from a road in the middle of the night, but doesn&apos;t it seem a punishment better suited to the crime?

Certainly it did to the law enforcement officers sent out to try to find Mr. Sims. The lieutenant who spoke for the City of Williams Police Department put it pretty well:&quot;You don&apos;t put anyone off in an area like that.&quot; 

That&apos;s how you get to be a spokesman - by leaving out phrases like,&quot;What are you, crazy?!&quot;

Amtrak got lucky. Coconino County sheriff&apos;s deputies found Mr. Sims. FOUR DAYS LATER. He was, miraculously, alive. Barefoot, dehydrated and disoriented. He&apos;d spent four days wandering in the wilderness, and I have no idea how long it will take him to recover, but he&apos;s alive.

 So the lawsuit, which I would handle for free if the state would let me, will not be for wrongful death, but merely victimization with outrageous stupidity compounded by a complete lack of perspective. 10  

Now, to borrow from the great legal philosopher Harry Callahan,&quot;I know what you&apos;re thinkin&apos;.&quot;You&apos;re thinking I&apos;m being too hard on Amtrak. You&apos;re thinking the stupid mistake of one or two conductors should hardly be allowed to tarnish the entire Amtrak leviathan.

And I&apos;d agree with you... if only they&apos;d kept their mouth shut. But they didn&apos;t. Neither did they immediately issue a statement that it was all a horrible mistake for which they were truly sorry. If they had, I&apos;d still be looking for a story with which to fill this space.

No, their official position is that they&quot;followed company policy.&quot;That&apos;s it. They think that&apos;s enough. They think that should resolve the matter. They followed company policy.

Apparently, company policy is to hire only lawyers who did not study the philosophy of punishment. Be interesting to see how that works out for them in this case. 
If there&apos;s any justice, they&apos;ll get a good, swift kick in the nerpsies.
1  Look it up; it&apos;s not what you think.

2  Professor Kadish, I apologize for doubting you.

3  Go ahead. You know you&apos;re thinking it. Go ahead and say it. The Henny Youngman line:&quot;Please.&quot;

4  Although, at the rate the present administration is driving up the deficit, it could belong to Rupert Murdoch before Christmas.

5  Personally, I would have gone with&quot;Midnight Flyer&quot;or&quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;or&quot;Occident Express.&quot;I guess that&apos;s why I&apos;m not invited to sit on many boards.

6  Technically, it was the middle of Arizona, but the distinction is too fine for me to understand.

7  Indeed, in California, it&apos;s often a civil commitment to a specialized facility mandated by the legislature almost forty years ago because they felt public drunks needed more help than they were being given. (See, Penal Code section 647 (g); Welfare&amp;Institutions Code section 5170.)

8  With the possible exception of Chris Day, who could be expected to kill a few bears for food (and for their booze, if they had any) and show up for breakfast the next morning, complaining that he was not provided with catsup.

9  At least Amtrak better HOPE he was drunk. If the family is right, that he was going into diabetic shock, the people who threw him off the train are liable to find themselves facing an arrest warrant from The Hague for human rights violations.

10  Remember, you sue Amtrak, it&apos;s a federal case. I&apos;m pretty sure victimization with extreme stupidity is a cause of action under the Federal Rules.
