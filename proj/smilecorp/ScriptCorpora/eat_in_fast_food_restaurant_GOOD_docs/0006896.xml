I don&apos;t eat there often, but I have never been disappointed in the fries. They are about the best I can get in my area. My problem with the burger is that it&apos;s too big, and I feel kind of sick after eating it. So I usually get a grilled cheese. Anyway, maybe your Five Guys is a bad one. Our is pretty consistantly good.

Do you get regular (two pattie) burger or the little burger? I find the little cheeseburger to be the perfect size for me. My problem with the fries is I eat too many and get a tummy ache if I don&apos;t have someone to split them with.

 re: Janet from Richmond 
The little bacon burger makes me so happy-it&apos;s perfect. I can almost finish it comfortably. But I can see how a big eater or someone who eats fast could be disappointed. The last time we ordered cajun fries (well done) they really skimped out and actually did not even fill the styro-cup. The fries we did get were stumpy ones, and if it had been our first trip I would have thought like our RCTriple-bummed out friend...
I care deeply for 5 guys and a new one is opening here in FL-VERY close (whoo hoo!)

I&apos;m replying to myself!
The new Five Guys opened in Lady Lake and we went- it was mobbed. I asked for the fries well done, then noticed she didn&apos;t type it in. I asked again, and she said &apos;They will be crispy&apos;. When the order came, the fries were soggy- I just brought them back to the counter and asked for an order well done- they apologized and the new fries were PERFECT.
It&apos;s going to take restraint not to go whenever I&apos;m out shopping...

 re: Janet from Richmond 
I made my first trip to Five Guys today, and loved it. The little burger (actually little cheeseburger with satuteed onions) was the perfect size for me, and my 14-month-old devoured his grilled cheese. I was warned about their fry serving sizes, so I caught the guy before he put our fries in and asked him to not put the extra scoop... I knew I would have eaten them all and felt guilty all afternoon!

 re: jeanmarieok 
I tried Five Guys in Kansas City area last week. I thought it was good. Burger okay. Fries, waay better than In-N-Out. Excellent, actually, compared to my researching how to do fries at home: cook at 300-325, to cook the inside, recook them at 375 to get crisp and soft and steamy inside. How come In-N-Out owners haven&apos;t figured out their fries are a really weak link? Two-stage cooking isn&apos;t rocket science.

I kindof think McD&apos;s may do first-stage vaccum-champbrer freeze-dry, sublimation under vacuum to reduce intra-cellular water. I&apos;m just guessing, but it works. You can alternatively cut frys and run them through a baker assembly line to eject water and do some cooking, then through them into the hot oil.

I&apos;m going to Smashburger in a couple weeks to see what they do.

At home, I either get some frozen ground buffalo, or some chuck or sirloin whole-meat and grind it so I can grill on the deck and have medium-rare without getting sick from bacteria.

Did you not notice the prices on the menu when you were ordering, or the fact that when you gave them a 10, you only got a George Washington back?

And, really, shame on you for driving 45 minutes for a Five Guys meal. I don&apos;t know of any chains that I would drive 45 minutes out of the wa for.

Also, if the fries were&quot;soggy&quot;how could you tell they were&quot;stale&quot;? How could the fries be stale -- ie. dry or hardened -- and also be soggy at the same time?

1. Quality Control at Five Guys varies widely from store to store. One will have excellent food/service; another will serve skunky meat.

2. The deal with the fries is that they MUST come out of the bag ASAP. The steam builds up and soggifies them at an alarming rate.

 re: monkeyrotica 
the meat was very good. it just wasn&apos;t INCREDIBLE like all of the hype says, but it was definitely a good tasting burger and surprisingly it wasn&apos;t burnt. i was pretty pissed when i asked them if they could take mine off the grill a little sooner because i dont like them well done, and they said no. although it was cooked perfectly and i think if they only cooked it medium itd be undercooked so that was good.
the double burger was just so ridiculously small. it was like two jr whopper patties on a thin bun but the taste was an 8/10. fuddruckers is ten times as good though.

the fries werent what ive heard about i didnt get a huge paperbag overflowing with fries i got a small cup of unevenly seasoned cajun fries that were soggy and old tasting.
it was definately a burger iwouldnt pay more than 4 dollars for, but if they lowered it to 4 dollars id definately get it again IF I WAS IN THE AREA..
but to answer the question of why would i drive 45 minutes to eat there? well ima fast food junkie i kid you not it is my life goal to eat at in n out and jack in the box before i die LOL im from new jersey so that&apos;s is kind of hard. but five guys is supposedly even better than in n out and there was one within driving distance so i putt he pedal to the medal and got some.
its funny this five guys was JAMMED packed so i guess everyone else likes paying 10 dollars for a burger slightly bigger than a bigmac burgers.double stack and a dixie cup of soggy fries.

yeah the closest one is 45 minutes or so away from me and its in a confusing area to get home from. but they have 1 pound burgers at decent prices and they cook it how you want. they dont force you to get it well done. and the taste is on point!

anyway i decided to give fiveguys another chance (dumb i know) i called in my order this time and ordered two of the double bacon cheeseburgers since one was not enough for me last time. i was then asked :no fried today?:
iwas thinking to myself no soggy fries today but thanks for asking. anyway i am glad i got this five guys thing out of my system the food is terrible. i mean one of my burgers tasted pretty good (not fuddruckers good) but the other was burnt and it was a struggle to get through.

i think when i have any more luxurious burger cravings ill skimp on the small over priced small 6.00 burgers that five guys has and go for the big 1 pounders at fuddruckers. what sucks is there was a fuddruckers that was very close to here but they closed down a long time ago. man what a mistake that was for them i would have been there every day all the time lols. apparently ostritch meat is popular at fuddruckers they were always sold out of its.

I always get the one-pounder at Fuddruckers, load it up, and devour the whole thing with onion rings to boot. I love their pico de gallo, cheese sauce, barbecue sauce, jalapenos, and just a bit of honey mustard on the burger. The Fuddruckers I grew up going to in Miami used to have a big vat of hot sauerkraut too, which I loved to eat on the side or create a&quot;Zimmerman Note Burger&quot;with kraut and pico de gallo. Unfortunately, the Fudds near me doesn&apos;t have sauerkraut.

Nothing at Five Guys even comes close to that level of awesomeness.

Thats right, I grudjingly tried that angus abomination at McD&apos;s the other day when Fudd&apos;s was les than 1/2 mile away. If I&apos;m going to pay $5+ for a burger I&apos;ll just go to Fudd&apos;s. Fresh homade grilled bun, meat cooked the way you want it, love their mustard and I&apos;ll put a heaping spoon of pico on a lettuce leaf to have with the burger. Kind of an&quot;out of hand&quot;salad. No more Mikky D&apos;s, done!

Every time a new business is opening in my neighborhood, I desperately hope it is a Fuddruckers. The closest one is 45 minutes away in the touristy part of Orlando, and even though I end up there a few times a year, I&apos;d much rather have one nearby.

It seems to depend on which 5 guys you go to. The one I go to is excellent.

Secondly, I would hardly call the burger small. If you only got one patty, that would be one thing but for some inexplicable reason, a single comes with two patties.

I liked the fries but they weren&apos;t great. You need to de-bag them ASAP so they don&apos;t steam.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By specification, a Five Guys burger is 3.3 ounces......personally, I would call that small for the patty itself.....it&apos;s arguable whether the final assembly of the burger is or is not small after all the toppings are ordered.....but consider that Five Guys Burger itself calls their single patty burger *Little Hamburger or Cheeseburger*. Their Hamburger/Cheeseburger is a double patty...at least here in New Jersey. That may be the reason for your belief *a single comes with two patties*......or the staff at your local FG&apos;s needs a remedial math course refresher.

btw, not a FG&apos;s Burger fan myself, although they do have nice peanuts and fries.

 re: fourunder 
well i got two doubles and that was just right for me. actually it was a little too much. was a struggle to eat it but ithink thats cause it was burnt. if it was like the first time i went i think two doubles would have been perfect. the patties may be double but they are not big patties. the patties are the size of a wendys double stack from the dollar menu. a tad bigger though. throw on some burnt bacopn and a little slice of cheese. i happened to enjoy the bun though i will defend their buns i know a lot of people dont like 5 guys buns but i enjoyed that part.

 re: RCTRIPLEFRESH5 
With the news of free peanuts I decided i had to try it the next opportunity I had to be near one. Which was Saturday.
I found the burger I had, a regular, to be very good and well-priced comparatively. The fries were very good, although I would have liked them to be a little crispier. If that were such a big deal for me, I would have ordered them well done. I did not, so I can&apos;t really complain. The service was very good, everyone was on top of everything, and I didn&apos;t feel like I was just part of a cattle line (step aside, please) as some of the line workers would chat with the waiting customers whenever they had a free moment.

Is Five Guys the best? No. Are they as good as the hype. Depends what hype you&apos;re talking about. Would i go back? Certainly.

Agreed. The OP&apos;s&quot;analysis&quot;has been somewhat inconsistent and contradictory. And I&apos;ve yet to have fries there that weren&apos;t far superior to any other chain.

His primary complaint is the burgers are too small -- the regular double patty burger is not enough, so he had to order 2.

As a critique, that makes no sense. A single patty is slightly less than a 1/4 pounder, the regular two patty burger is 6.6 ounce -- well over a Wendy&apos;s single, a McD&apos;s quarter pounder, BK Whopper, etc. Have you seen anyone whose chief complaint about THESE fast food burgers is that they are too small?

Sorry, but if you&apos;re eating 2 Five Guys burgers -- 4 patties altogether. You are pigging out (not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that, but don&apos;t complain). Based on his language, writing style, and eating habits, he seems to be either a high school or college age boy, so I guess the ravenous appetite is expected.

It&apos;s always seemed to me that he disliked this place disproportionately. That said, there&apos;s a burger chain up here that I felt was such a rip off that I was actually mad. Not just didn&apos;t like the place. I was flat out mad.

well ive eaten a lot of burgers in my days and this was not much bigger than a double stack. i didnt totally bash this place either. i said the fries were limp but tasty, and the burger meat was pretty good quality. i did not totally bash this place but i did say that it was bad experience. i then gave everyone the benefit of the doubt and went back there to give it another shot and was not happy with it. fuddruckers and cheeburger cheeburger blow this place out of the water. 14oz burger with pepperjack cheese,marinara sauce,onion rings,pepperoni lettuce for 8.49. 3.00 more than five guys but over twice the size. and cheeburger offers toppings i actually like. i didnt get any extra toppings on my 5 guys burger. i make my cheeburger to taste like a pizza sort of.
just because one double fills you up does not make a 6 oz burger big. its not uncommon at all to see people get two double quarter pounders at mcdonalds. besides i can afford to pig out i ma weightlifter i need the fuel.

My experience has been that you might get more at Fuddruckers, but it doesn&apos;t necessarily taste any better than a good Five Guys. However, Fuddruckers is fairly consistent from store to store; Five Guys not so much.

And really, if you want a burger that&apos;s&quot;small as f*ck&quot;there are plenty of gourmet slider places where you get three small as f*ck burgers and they hand you a bill for the month&apos;s rent.

I&apos;ve gotten plenty of huge and tasteless burgers in my time and I&apos;d much rather have a good but small Five Guys burger. Size is not the end all and be all of cuisine. Five guys is a fast food restaurant where the sizes tend to be a bit smaller than what you see at full-service places like CC and Fuddruckers. I really haven&apos;t talked to anyone who found the Five Guys regular cheeseburger to be inadequate, so I imagine that most people who visit it would not be interested in a gigantic 3/4 pound burger. People don&apos;t want to spend that much money and often have less time to eat when they go to places like Five Guys.

well all i know is that if i remember correctly a 1 pound burger with big slices of cheese at fudds is 8.00. they also cook itmedium, and i found it to be the best tasting burger ive had at any chain or restaurant. i enjoyed the ruby tuesdays triple prime burger equally although it wasnt as big as the fudds obviously. i do think the meat at 5 guys was very good quality, although i like chee burgers and fudds better, and to be honest i think chee burger is a rip off too but it is slightly less of a rip then 5 guys. fudds is a good value if the prices havent increased. i feel that even if five guys is a great chain, they should not be as busy as they are in comparison to a place like fudds but thats my personal opinions. i guess

But I used to work near one say 10 years ago it was a very good deal
I would stroll up to the produce and condiment bar and get enough tomato onion and lettuce for a decent salad. I would rate it ahead of 5Guys except that 5Guys french fries reign supreme

 re: zzDan 
As has been documented elsewhere, the sogginess of 5G fries has nothing to do with them sitting out and getting stale. The fries are always made fresh. However, they get soggy if left in the bag for any amount of time. If you&apos;re not eating them in store, open the bag immediately to let out the steam. Otherwise, by the time you&apos;re ready to eat the fries, the steam builds up inside the closed bag and they go soggy.

OK I&apos;m a peasant

I&apos;m sure there are better french fries but they aren&apos;t worth the drive and with 5Guys @$2.25 for small fries it&apos;s my kind of bargain. They always give a humongous serving

Absolutely. They&apos;re as good as any fresh fries you can get at a fair/festival, and at a good price too. You HAVE to vent the bag a bit - after tossing the &apos;fry container&apos;, shaking in salt/pepper and giving it a good shake. These fries are way the hell too good to have a customer mess them up.

The french fries are fantastic w generous portions. They&apos;ll cook them a bit longer if I ask and they are not too busy. The hamburgers were OK as far as I&apos;m concerned

Plus the roasted peanuts to snack on are a nice touch. I always eat a bunch

Tried my first one yesterday. I thought it was a good size, and the meat, while overcooked for my tastes, was flavorful. I wish they had real cheese though. The onions were ok, but the mushrooms really didn&apos;t have any taste. Will have to go back and try the fries, I wasn&apos;t that hungry yesterday.

Though it wouldn&apos;t drive me to the F-bomb (twice!), Five Guys does, indeed, suck. Overpriced, low-flavor beef with too-soft buns that disintegrate and way, way too many non-meat toppings.

Wrapping the severely undersalted fries tightly in the bag the second they&apos;re done cooking guarantees they&apos;ll steam and lose their crunch almost instantaneously. Even when you open the bag as soon as you get to your table, they&apos;ve already lost almost all their positive qualities.

I&apos;ll never go back. Their success is due to the atmosphere and the perceived&quot;value&quot;of getting more fries than one person should eat in a sitting. Total garbage&quot;upscale&quot;fast food.

IMO, they do have the best chain fries, but the last few burgers I&apos;ve had became soggy in their wrapping. Best part about their fries is that I no longer eat frozen fries. Frozen potato products are simply disgusting, about as flavorful as their cardboard containers, but with excessive calories.

I tried Five Guys for the first time this weekend. I would not consider it a disappointment after reading this thread. I do agree that the hamburger patties are on the bland side but nothing a few sprinkles of salt and other condiments could not remedy. Their fries however are delicious. Thick, crisp, hot out of the fryer. I find that the regular fries taste better because they are not disguised by the heavy cajun seasoning that the cajun fries have. Overall, not a bad experience. Is is the best burger I have ever eaten? No. Is it something I would revisit again? Of course.

I had the same experience. The burger (regular bacon) meat quality was somewhat better than regular fast food but not leaps and bounds. Overall the burger was small.

The fries (smallest size, regular $4.95) were enough for two people (why not offer a smaller size?).

Certainly I didn&apos;t think the experience warranted $14.95. For the same price I can go to a trendy bistro and get a much larger burger with even better beef and a decent portion of fries.

...Or I could just go to Wendy&apos;s, sacrifice a little quality, and pay half as much.

5 Guys days are limited. No real flavor to their burgers. Homemade style fries are for when you were 10 years old. They suck. I&apos;ll be glad to see them all close up shop later this year.

Just went to 5 guys here in MA and at 11:30am the place was packed. Maybe it is the location but the fries were great, no sogginess at all. Burger was fine as well. Seriously doubt they&apos;ll close later this year from what I&apos;ve seen around here as well as what I&apos;ve eaten.

I think it&apos;s extremely safe to predict that 5 Guys will not be closing up later this year or any year. Some locations always don&apos;t pan out--for example, I know of one on I-81 in Virginia that is no more, but that only suggests that Interstate exits may not be optimal for them. It is the kind of place that develops a local following and needs a local repeat, not a transient, clientele.

Maybe LuckyMike would like to put his money where his mouth is and bet me, say, $1000, that all 5 Guys will be closed by the end of this year. My money&apos;s on the table Mike.....

We discovered Five Guys last year about this time.
(We live out in the boondocks, so we often aren&apos;t on the cutting edge of anything.) But we (Mr. Shallots and I) both had known Fuddruckers for going on three decades and we&apos;ve watched a lot of them close.
Five Guys is an interesting concept, well executed. It can&apos;t hold a candle to INandOUT burgers from the west coast. (We did some couple of days apart comparison testing in May.)
We&apos;ve had Five Guys in five states and haven&apos;t had a bad meal. We do eat in (and forgive them the ambience.) (But then, we aren&apos;t paying for the ambience either.) Five Guys may be Mr Shallots favorite out of town cheap eats. We&apos;ve grown to trust them and haven&apos;t been dissapointed, nor have they given us food poisoning. And when we travel, that latter lack is much appreciated.

And that&apos;s the trade-off for not being able to order your burger less than well done. A lot of folks complain about 5G overcooking their burgers, and not being willing to do it less done to the customer&apos;s preference. 5G seems to have made the corporate decision not to take a chance. I will say, however, that in spite of the degree of cooking they seem to be juicy (greasy?) enough to me.

I got food poisoning from a medium rare burger at local place with really good burgers once. No fun. But how one prefers his/her burgers depends on one&apos;s own risk tolerance.

According to their website, there are over 250,000 possible ways to order a burger @ Five Guys. Two Points....

1. If that&apos;s not trying to cook to your preference, what would you say they are trying to achieve to be different an any other place. For many, that alone discounts them from having the best burger.

2. Out of over 250,000 possible combinations ......rare is not possible in one of them.

I kept going back to Five Guys about six times, hoping to start liking it, but it just doesn&apos;t do it for me. The fries LOOK delicious, but they&apos;re totally bland. They only offer American cheese for the burgers, and American cheese is cheap, sucky cheese. They can&apos;t even provide a cheddar option at those prices? I started ordering my grilled mushrooms on the side b/c if they put the mushrooms on the burger before they wrap it up, the whole burger gets soggy. But when I went to put my&quot;side&quot;mushrooms on, I noticed they smelled horrible so I left them off. After my last visit, I decided I don&apos;t ever need to eat there again. I can get a better burger at Backyard Burgers, or even Checkers.

5G uses fresh cut Idaho potatoes, they fry them in peanut oil,salt them, then serve. What in your opinion is wrong with that? Whose french fries do you prefer, and how are they different? Did you try using malt vinegar on them, as is recommended?

I disagree with this. I make french fries at home, I go to other restaurants that make fresh cut fries, they are never, ever dark, dark brown and mostly hard, like they are at 5 guys. I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re frying them in, but I&apos;ve tried them 4 times and they&apos;re always way dark and they don&apos;t taste good. Probably from the oil they&apos;re using.

I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the oil they&apos;re using, I think it&apos;s their technique. Even if they fry at a high temperature, the fries are going to be soggy. Places that serve belgian frites fry once at 450 to partially cook the fries then, when an order comes in, they fry them again at 475. You end up with a light, crisp fry that isn&apos;t soggy or greasy. Unfortunately, this technique requires separate fryers at different temperature, which is why most fastfood places don&apos;t use this technique.

Mcdonalds avoids the two-fryer problem by using pre-fried frenchfries.

Isn&apos;t it 350 and 375 for the double fry? I think oil breaks down much over 400.

In any event, I think I saw an article that indicated Five Guys DOES double fry. I&apos;ve brought home and yes, they are soggy, but that is unavoidable. When I&apos;ve eaten in the place, they are hot, crispy and not greasy.

You&apos;re right about the 350/375 thing.

I&apos;ve also had pretty good luck just opening the fry bag as I drive home. Greatly reduces the sogginess; doesn&apos;t help the ones at the bottom of the cup though.

I&apos;ve had authentic belgian frites twice and didn&apos;t like those either, they are also really dark colored and mostly hard. I actually prefer a&quot;soggy&quot;fry, but the ones I&apos;ve had from 5 guys just taste...bad. Overdone or something. They get a little&quot;soggy&quot;from steaming in the bag, but not the same thing as a regular, limp fry, which I like. For example, when we go to the fair every year, there are stand after stand selling fresh cut fries. They schlump them through a shoestring-fry cutter right there, dump them in oil and cook while you wait. They are white colored, like the inside of a potato, not dark brown/spotted/mottled like 5G fries, and largely rather limp, spilling over the sides of the cup they overstuff with the tasty, hot goodness. THOSE are fries. The hard, dark things at 5G? Not for me. I just don&apos;t get the appeal.

Well, you&apos;re talking a personal preference thing, then. The&quot;fairgrounds fries&quot;are, as you pointed out, a single fry. This means they are considered&quot;done&quot;when the moisture has evaporated and the fry starts to absorb oil. Hence the sogginess. A double fry cooks the fry to the point where most of the moisture has steamed out -- but not all. They are cooked through, but pulled out of oil before they can reabsorb. They then get a second dunk to crisp them. The double fry is the quote-unquote proper way of doing it. But it doesn&apos;t mean everyone has to like it that way.

YES! I think you&apos;ve hit on it. The belgian frites I had are also double fried and I can&apos;t stand them. That being said, local lore says one of our best local chefs double fries his shoestring fries that are served with his lunch plates, and I love them. They are crispy, not soggy, but they are not brown and don&apos;t look taste burned or dry. Not sure what the difference is. Hmm.

Typically, shoestrings get a single fry. They are the exception to the double-fry rule because they are so thin they can cook to crispy with one go at it.

The brown-ness you refer to could be due to FG (or whoever) reusing the fry oil over and over without proper straining. Any little starching bits that remain in the oil can burn, breakdown, and cause a darkening of the oil and the items being fried in it. This can also impart an off-flavor.

I don&apos;t know if FG is guilty of this, but could be....

Oh, and if french fries need to be doused in malt vinegar, or anything else for that matter, in order to taste good, or to taste the way they&apos;re&quot;supposed to&quot;or&quot;recommended,&quot;then they can&apos;t be that great to begin with. As much as I enjoy honey mustard on fries, good french fries stand on their own when the desired condiment is not available.

I don&apos;t know why you spend so much time bashing Five Guys. It is in mall food courts next to Chick-Fil-A and Sbarro, so I can&apos;t see it as anything other than a fast food joint. Yes, there are freestanding Five Guys, but typical sit-down restaurants like CC or Fuddruckers are not places where you can order something in the food court and get it in 2 minutes.

Whatever category Five Guys falls into, I don&apos;t think it is the same as CC or Fuddruckers, which both employ servers and have a much larger selection of items.

The only two places I have had a Fudd Burger outside of NJ was in Myrtle Beach and Orlando.....which were set up exactly as they were here in NJ.

 re: fourunder 
You&apos;re semi-right about Fuddruckers. IIRC, and it&apos;s been a while, they don&apos;t have servers, but they do give you your food on a plate on a tray. Cheeburger Cheeburger is definitely a sit down and they bring you your food, again on a plate. 5G gives you your stuff in a paper bag and they have tables if you want to hang around. So 5G ambiance is definitely downscale from the others. Maybe that&apos;s what was in queen&apos;s mind.

As to the comparison with 5G burger quality, IMO both of them turn out a more elaborate burger than 5G, but the basic quality is worse, and moreso with the sides especially fries. Perhaps the basic issue here is that our OP is confusing variety of toppings with fundamental quality. To each his own I suppose.

I&apos;m having a very hard time fathoming what you&apos;re trying to say.

1. What is a&quot;practical&quot;topping?

2. What is&quot;standard&quot;about grilled onions at 5G?---they list 15 toppings, of which 6 you have to ask for and 9 that you presumably don&apos;t and thus would be automatic if you didn&apos;t specify, but I have always specified exactly what I wanted from among the entire 15 and I think that&apos;s what most people do.

3. You said&quot;i didnt say the quantity was better just the quality and the quantity./&quot;Please clarify this rather interesting assertion.

4. In your post of Oct 13, you said

&quot;cheeburger has amazing free toppings, like marinara sauce, onion rings, peanut butter(which i find strange) and lettuce and peperroni (they have more but those are the ones iget)&quot;

Are these the&quot;practical toppings&quot;to which you referred? Also, please clarify how anyone who has such toppings on a hamburger could be in any position to evaluate the quality of the burger itself.

5. Finally, I would note that it is helpful to readers&apos; understanding if posters use a modicum of correct grammar, style, and spelling.

I consider Five Guys to be fast casual, not fast food. The setup is more like Panera than McDonalds. I have never seen a Five Guys in a mall food court. The (at least) four locations I&apos;ve been to in Orlando are all in nice outdoor shopping centers with not a Sbarro or other fast food join in sight. Fudds is slightly better, and Cheeburger is considerably better.

Five Guys is about to open a new store in a very prominent location at 14th and I above the McPherson Sq Metro station in DC. I expect this place to be mobbed from the jump as the lunch options around here in the moderate price range are pathetic. I plan to give it a try, since I have not had Five Guys for a long time.

Five Guys has finally made it to my part of the country (Ohio) and hubby and I went for the first time yesterday. The location we visited was incredibly noisy, so I don&apos;t recommend eating in. And since they basically just dump the VERY GREASY fries directly into a paper bag, I recommend having some way to keep them from greasing up the car as you take them home. I thought the burger was slightly better than average for a fast food burger. The bun was the same gummy cheap white bread thing you get at a lot of places and was a detraction as opposed to an enhancement of the burger. About half the burger and a handful of fries were all I was able to eat, and I&apos;m usually a glutton for fast food and grease. As fast food goes this is not cheap. I won&apos;t be back.

I can&apos;t answer for RC but I ate the fries in the restaurant within moments of being served. I couldn&apos;t understand how they could be so simultaneously greasy and flavorless. There&apos;s a regional chain in my area called Penn Station which also fresh cuts and fries in peanut oil, and theirs are delicious. How do you actually extract the flavor from something which by all accounts should be tasty?

5G just opened near my office in Boca Raton Fl, I have been there 3 times now and I much prefer it to McD&apos;s or BK but it is more expensive. Still we order the junior burgers, share fries and it comes to around 6 bucks each.

I think many of the comments here are complaining for no good reason, it&apos;s just burgers and fries, the potatoes are real, grab some peanuts and enjoy.

ok, so i went to 5 guys today, and got my &apos;&apos;usual&apos;&apos; i ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon, no fries. since i was eating i nthe restaruant i decided to try the peanuts.

the peanuts were absolutely disgusting. t hey tasted like an old stale popcorn, if i wasnt such a cheapskate i would have bought a drink to wash it down, but i just ate my burger and washed it down.

the service was ok, i waited 5 minutes for my food. it kind of annoyed me when they called my number they said bacon cheeseburger with no fries...kind of pointing out how i didnt pay for the fries

the burger was tasty. i rate it a 7.5. it was pretty good. i got mayo, ketchup, and lettuce on mine. the lettuce was horrible so i removed it. the burger was good, but i would rate a wendy&apos;s burger a 7/10 and five guys a 7.5/10. i definately wont be driving out to five guys again. however i will be in the area again on monday, and i plan on getting two bacon cheeseburgers, and maybe springing for a coke this time. (small coke since the refills are free i think? lol) i wasnt super hungry going into five guys, but when i finished my burger i was left wanting more so that is a great sign. i think 5 guys is a decent burger joint, but i still fail to understand why its so popular i dont get it. with a bogo coupon i can get two wendys doubles for 4 dollars. and im pretty sure they are bigger as well. or i could go to BK and get 3 double cheeseburgers for 3 dollars.

oh and the burger kept falling aparrt, the bun remained ok, but the meat was falling apart.

Five Guys is a burger without a heart. It comes pretty, the bun is soft, the toppings ample, the cheese gloppy (um, just American?)...but the burger just isn&apos;t available...it&apos;s like it&apos;s not there. There is no flavor to it. They do everything right, except it isn&apos;t a good burger. They even give you plenty of fries...except they are bland and lightweight. For two dollars more, including tip, you can get a better burger brought to your table. I think that is more desirable.

i went to 5 guys for the first time last friday. had a late lunch before a long night of drinking before/during/after a college football game. interestingly simple menue: burges w/ or w/o cheese and w/ or w/o bacon, two sizes plus dogs, fries, and drinks. the build your own concept with a lot of toppings at no charge included things that you are almost always charged extra for like mushrooms and grilled onions. a good profit enhancement move because, given the prices, everybody pays for the extras whether they want them or not.

i ordered a cheeseburger and a small fry, no drink. $8+. liked the free peanuts - had a dish full while waiting. i was surprised that the burger was a double patty. melty/gooey cheese, a bit greasy- kind of like a slider. decent. the fries were thick cut. i watched the guy behind the counter carefully measure out a styrofoam cup, put it in the bag, then grab a little metal tray filled with fries and dumped them in the bag. essentially a large fry for the price of a small. by the time i got to the table, the bag was spotted with grease from the fries. i am not opposed to greasy fries but i would have preferred them to be more crisp. i also wish that i had paid closer attention to the menu and tried the cajun fries.

overall, decent but a bit pricey. i may go back, but i will not go out of my way to go there.

You didn&apos;t miss anything with the cajun fries. The spicing really isn&apos;t that interesting. Just ask for the regular fries&quot;extra crispy&quot;and they&apos;ll keep them in the fryer a bit longer.

It is interesting to note that underdone fries are one of the most frequently heard complaints about In-N-Out. Asking for them&quot;well done&quot;there is almost an axiom.

I have to say that I have never gotten the 5 guys hype. tried it once, didn&apos;t think it was anything special, was told by a 5 guy fanatic that it must be a bad location, so tried a recommended location, Nope still nothing to write home about. than one opened near me and of course my girlfriend wanted to try it, so I got dragged to that one too, and we both walked out thinking we would have gotten a better burger and fries at a local place that serves a real burger cooked to order, for the same price.

we faxed an order to 5 guys today from our office, left 10 mins later and was there within 15 minutes. Nothing was ready. Waited another 10, got back to the office and they had made every single burger wrong, all the numbering was wrong, none of us had fried onions except for the person who didn&apos;t want them, pickles added when not requested and the veggie burger was omitted from the bun so one person had just bread and tomatoes for lunch.

Okay, I&apos;ve now made 5 visits, all to the same 5 Guys.

I can honestly say that I&apos;m surprised at the inconsistency even at one location.

First of all, 2 times the burgers were absolutely fantastic. A diner style burger, just a hint of pink with a great balance of meat, cheese, bacon, condiments and bun.
1 time is was just shy of that.
1 time it was quite good but certainly not great.
1 time it was merely good.

One complaint I will voice is the person slicing onions needs to check them. A couple times I&apos;ve bit into a rather large chunk and that isn&apos;t much fun.

5 Guys is overpriced. The food is nothing special, okay... but why pay double for what you would get at Wendy&apos;s? The 5 Guys food is cooked to order - I really can&apos;t taste the difference, but it means 5 or 10 extra minutes waiting around to get your food. Also, if the secret to &apos;good&apos; fries is to get them out of the bag ASAP, then why on earth does 5 Guys put every order (including the&quot;to stay&quot;orders) in a bag, in the first place? It&apos;s not an accident that the fries are getting steamed - 5 Guys is making it happen. I have to outsmart my fast food restaurant? Totally overrated and overpriced, and no reason to go there in my opinion.

I tried Five Guys for the first time last night (they are new to AZ) and I have to say I *loved* it. The burger was juicy, fresh and tasty, and I loved the fresh veggies on top, and the soft bun. And the fries were perfect - hot and salty. I can&apos;t wait to go back. Yes, it is more expensive than Wendys but I thought it was way better and I&apos;d rather spend the few extra bucks for a great burger every once in a while.

serve an overcooked 3.3oz piece of way too greasy meat, slap it on a cheap bun and slathered with fair toppings. market it right and they will come. tell people the origin of the potatoes and all of a sudden they will feel they are perfect when in fact they are usually under or overcooked. sometimes place some salt on and sometimes don&apos;t. while they wait serve them low end peanuts.

and yet the place makes money.

do not bet against the bad taste of the american public.

Well J. As I&apos;ve said before, my opinion is exactly the opposite.

I prefer the cheap bun to a fancy one on a burger. The burgers I&apos;ve had have all been great. Maybe a touch greasy but it&apos;s a diner style burger. They&apos;re supposed to be a bit greasy.

My fries have always been cooked perfectly too. Never over or under done.

As has been pointed out, the quality control of this franchise it horrendous.

Recently, I had some hand-cut fries at a local white tablecloth eatery. They were horrible: parts were burn, parts were soggy, and someone went overboard with the kosher salt. The next day, I had a side order of plain old frozen Ore-Ida crinkle cut fries from a Chinese carryout. And they were awesome: fried hot and hard in fresh oil, they had a uniformly crispy crust, steamy potato interior, and just the right amount of salt.

Just because it&apos;s a hand-cut fry from some magic potato garden doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s going to taste good, and just because it comes out of a 20lb Sysco bag doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s going to taste bad. It all comes down to whether the cook knows what they&apos;re doing and whether they care enough to do it right.

Most frozen fries are pre-cooked; throwing them in 475 degree oil gives them that&quot;second cooking&quot;that the best fries are supposed to get.

And I didn&apos;t get them at a restaurant, I got them at a chinese carryout. 5 whole fried chicken wings with frenchfries for $6.

I love the fries but they are more like English chips than the over crispy often hollow American frozen ones. And they are especially good with the malt vinegar they supply and they then become more Englishified. Now if they would only do a good bit of battered cod or plaice ....................

I&apos;ve eaten at 5 Guys a couple times and while I find their burgers to be very good, they are not as good as In &apos;n Out&apos;s. The flavor of the beef was just OK. The topping choices is what sets 5 Guys apart from other fast food chain burgers.

I do not recommend ordering to go. They wrap their burgers in foil, and while that works well keeping in the heat, it also keeps in all the moisture which makes the bun real soggy.

In CT - the 5 guys franchise is owned by one group.

They mash the sh!t out of the burgers when cooking them - well done hockey pucks.

Other than that, the iced tea is acceptable with the lemons provided.

And the fries are among the best if eaten on the premises.

Other than that, and a coronary by-pass,&quot;how was the play Mrs. Lincoln?&quot;

5 Guys came here, but they went out of business in about a year. It looks like a Chinese restaurant may be taking that space soon.

My thoughts are that the toppings bar is supposed to be the big draw, but I have two sons who only like very basic toppings. I&apos;m not really all that keen on all the extra stuff. I like to taste the burger.

The biggie (especially with a basic burger) in this area, I&apos;m pretty sure, was the price. My older son went to 5 Guys from the YMCA where he worked. Double burgers with fries and a drink were close double the fast food joints, and 5 Guys does look fast&quot;foodie.&quot;They were teens and caught off caught on the prices. While they had cash to do the Burger King across the road, they tapped out at 5 Guys, and my son used the back up credit card I gave him. The other boys paid him back. But, the YMCA kids passed the word, and I doubt any of them went back (as a meal at that price would cut into an after school paycheck in a big kind of way).

I would expect to pay a premium price for a better burger and fries, but I can&apos;t honestly say that the local 5 Guys was any better than the fast food chains (and not as good as some) - priced quite a bit lower. I went on opening day and one other time.

They didn&apos;t make it here. The economy is bad. But, burger joints tend to do well here. Even the chains that charge more sell a lot of burgers. It seemed like they banked on a salad bar to toss on the burgers in an area where that is not going to sell. And, they priced out for a place that looked and felt like McDonalds.

I completely agree. There is no Five Guys near our home, so when one opened in Anaheim, I made my daughter take me when I visited her a couple of months ago. The wait was long, there weren&apos;t enough places to sit, and they completely lost my order ... okay, I came for the food. The burger was greasy greasy greasy and the bun was spongy and had no taste. Likewise the fries. I was disappointed - we see all these raves about it on TV, on the Today show and everything, and it was just awful. I wanted a good burger. Choices? - I get more choices at Carl&apos;s Jr., the burgers are better, definitely the fries are better and they&apos;re everywhere. I feel so bad about this, I hate to write anything bad about anyone, they&apos;re people too, but this hype is wrong and it&apos;s misleading!

I&apos;m not a fan of 5&apos;s, but I actually like their basic bun. Sure, it&apos;s no brioche or something that adds much, but it does a good job of holding the greasy patties and has what I think is an enjoyable texture.

i am pretty picky, particularly about chain food/fast food. there&apos;s a 5 guys at our mall in the food court and they consistenly turn our really good fries, burgers, and hot dogs that are cooked to order. i don&apos;t think you can say that about most places. and they are certainly not small, sometimes we forget and accidentally order the&quot;regular&quot;which is 2 patties and way too much food. not sure if the problem is other locations are not consistent or what. consider the price of a regular burger at wendy&apos;s or red robin and in my opinion, 5 guys is much better and better quality

...and much more expensive. You conveniently forgot to mention that. You can&apos;t compare a place like Red Robin or Islands to Five Guys because Five Guys does not have servers. That&apos;s like comparing apples to oranges. In-n-Out is the closest thing to it and is WAY better and costs HALF the price. I certainly hope this burger joint fails miserably on the West coast.

My brother&apos;s family used to love the place, but the last time we went, the service was just horrible. My nieces, who were six the last time we all went, are particular but good eaters when they get what they like. The amount of seasoning on their food (a chicken sandwich that came out spicy as well as the over-seasoned fries) really challenged their usual good behavior. They ordered off the kids&apos; menu, so what they received was entirely unexpected

I agree that they are not the incredible amazing burger they claim to be, but my fries were fresh and good, the burger was on the large side (certainly bigger than In &apos;n Out&apos;s, which is the best fast food burger BTW) and I thought they were good. Certainly better than Carls, BK, MacDonalds and the National chains.

Very few people would call the double burger &apos;small&apos;. The little burger is a normal sized burger, my husband and I go and spend $12.67... The small fry is more than enough to share between 2/3 people. A double cheese burger is $6.19, with whatever you want added to it, that&apos;s CHEAP...

I challenge you to go to a restaurant where you can add bbq sauce, cheese, jalapeno, grilled mushrooms and onion, and spend less than $6.34... A DOUBLE burger and 2 orders of cajun fries would be about $9 at a fast food restaurant, and this is NOT fast food, they don&apos;t freeze the meat. I happen to love their burgers, and 2/3 times I didn&apos;t like the fries, but they use different potatoes all the time, I think it&apos;s cool.

But a rip off? No sir, you don&apos;t need a double burger. And share a small fry. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap and good.

It&apos;s hard to get good chain burgers. Burger King used to have it, Jack-in-the-Box. Then came E coli nasty strain. It wasn&apos;t the hamburger vendors fault, it was the meat packers.

There&apos;s something to be said for home-cooking. Take a sirloin steak, a chuck roast, whatever you want, and grind it yourself and throw it on the &apos;cue. We never had to do this in&quot;The Olden Days.&quot;Bob Cummings, said, in the 1960s,&quot;If you get ground beef, it might be contaminated by trichinosis-ground pork leftovers in the grinder. Grind your own beef at home.&quot;

Take-home lesson, there have been risks for a long time. Vegans say,&quot;Go with veggies.&quot;They&apos;ve been contaminated with E coli too. The only good news is, if you aren&apos;t severely immunocomprimized, you&apos;ll survive, with nothing than a case of runs.

&quot;Totally safe food&quot;? Not possible. Attempts to achieve it, tastes crappy.

I tried the Five Guys in Las Vegas, what a joke and a 1/2. The place is way too crowded with stuff everywhere it&apos;s not supposed to be, and when you are spending $7-13 on a burger, it should be better prepared than what I got yesterday.

Breezymoon, I can make my own 1/2lb burger at home for less than that, including onions, BBQ sauce, mushrooms, etc. While it&apos;s nice to know some places can make a good burger still (SmashBurger is excellent), I won&apos;t be going back to five guys any time in the near future.

You can always make things cheaper at home... that&apos;s the point of going out, it&apos;s going to cost more for the convenience. Your home kitchen is not hiring people or paying rent. The point was that people were calling it expensive, and $12.67 for TWO people to eat is CHEAP... People shouldn&apos;t be eating 1/2 pound burgers, that&apos;s why our country is fat. Five Guys little burger is plenty for normal people, and at $4.89 WITH BACON CHEESE AND ANY TOPPINGS, it is CHEAPER THAN FAST FOOD, but it&apos;s not fast food.

Yes, it&apos;s a ripoff. Our family of four could go to the sit down Islands (where you have a server) and spend about the same price. The Island burgers are also 10 million times better. Charging almost $40 for a fast food type restaurant is simply WAY too expensive.

Are you letting each kid get their own GIGANTIC fries? A SMALL fry is enough for 2-3 people. How are you spending $40? Each person gets a soda with free refills? Share a soda or skip it. I have no idea how you&apos;d spend so much since a 1/4 burger is $4.89 with bacon and cheese, and a 1/2 pound Chris Farley FATTY burger is $6.19 with bacon and toppings that cost up to $1.00 each ... Place by my house charges $1 each for mushrooms, bbq sauce, jalapenos, etc. I wouldn&apos;t call a place expensive just because you go in and order the entire store. If your family is eating a fry each that&apos;s something else to look at. My husband is a BIG eater, and I&apos;m no skinny minnie, and we spend $12.67 for 2 people. Sounds like you should look at your choices. It would be nice for 5 guys to do a kids burger though, that was smaller than 1/4 pound.

I couldn&apos;t agree more! A Five Guys restaurant recently opened up in Corona, CA and I decided to take my family there to try it out. When I saw the prices I couldn&apos;t believe it! $5 to $7 for a burger? Almost $3 for a regular fries?? Add in expensive drinks and the total for my family came to $35! That&apos;s INSANE. My thought was that these better be exceptional burgers. The burgers were no better than a premium burger at McDonald&apos;s which is half the price. I kid you not. I also couldn&apos;t believe that they just used crappy American cheese and it wasn&apos;t even melted all the way. We did enjoy the Cajun fries but for $3 they were still way too expensive.

Besides the outrageous prices for mediocre burgers, the one thing that really floored me was the fact that they refused to accommodate certain requests. For example, I wanted to buy the large fries but I asked if I could have half Cajun and half regular. The respones was that they can&apos;t do that. Huh? Second, my wife enjoys the protein burgers at In-n-Out and she asked if they could just wrap the burger in lettuce. Again, the response was a resounding no. The cashier had the audacity to say&quot;...just take off the bun.&quot;This is NOT good customer service.

My family will be sticking with the far better and far less expensive In-n-Out. It costs us about HALF the price and the burgers are way better in my opinion. Five Guys will not be getting any more business from me. I can&apos;t understand why this burger restaurant is so popular on the East coast. It truly baffles me. Perhaps they&apos;ve been hypnotized by the free peanuts.

5G is popular on the East coast (specifically NoVA and DC where they got started) because there is no In-n-Out. We&apos;re stuck with Burger King/McD&apos;s/Wendy&apos;s for fastfood burgers and Good Stuff Eatery/Shake Shack/BGR for the&quot;gourmet&quot;burgers. So you can either get cheap slop burgers or the $15 gourmet stuff. The only thing in between is Five Guys.

Yeah, you have no idea how pissy people in my state get that we have no In n Out. I&apos;ve never gotten to try one, but for now, I can make my burger outings at Five Guys super cheap, less than fast food. $3 for fries is HUGE, should feed 2-3 fat people. I&apos;ll stick with them until someone with a brain brings In N Out to Oregon.

LOL...I&apos;d hardly call just getting fries an acceptable way to&quot;fill up&quot;but to each their own. That simply would not entice me to keep coming back. BTW, for $3 you can get two orders of fries at In-n-Out which I think would be about the same (if not more) fries.

Oh, and to comment on your post asking how we spent close to $40. It was rather easy and we definitely did not go overboard. I think the 4 burgers came to around $23 (insane), 1 large fries for almost $4 (which we all shared and really INSANE), 4 small drinks for $8 (enormously insane). That&apos;s $35 plus tax or almost $40 (outrageously INSANE). Yes, I suppose we could have gone without drinks and asked for water but to me the fact that you would even need to do this tells me the place is clearly a huge ripoff.

I refuse to support places like Five Guys that overcharge you for no apparent reason.

I&apos;m definitely in the&quot;meh&quot;category with 5 Guys. I just feel greasy after eating there, and the food doesn&apos;t blow me away. It&apos;s ok... but I could go to Wendy&apos;s for much cheaper and achieve a similar satisfaction level. Yeah, the extra toppings are great, but... it just doesn&apos;t move me.

Recently, however, I&apos;ve discovered smashburger, and that just blows me away. Plus, I can go a little teensy bit healthier there with a black bean burger and herb-seasoned sweet potato fries. (Meanwhile, 5 Guys is uniformly a health nightmare.) They also have Tazo&apos;s Awake Tea for their iced tea, which is excellent. And they provide very personalized service (heck, the girl behind the counter remembers my name based on my weekly visits). They&apos;re totally worth the extra cost above a run-of-the-mill fast food joint.

5 Guys is good, but not good enough to spend 2x as much as In-N-Out. My single burger w cheese, fries and coke was just under $10...at In-N-Out, it&apos;s $4.95 for the same order. This is not even a competition.

Which is why many of us on the East Coast are begging for In-N-Outs.

I hate to rain on your parade, but In&amp;Out is not the answer, unless you&apos;re looking for really cheap, tasteless (unless doctored up w/ gross sauce, pepper&amp;salt)burgers.
Best thing about I&amp;O;is it is clean, and the workers seem to really like working there.
The burger, fries&amp;shakes are worth exactly what they cost as orangeplow stated&quot;$4.95&quot;
Give me Fatburger or Fuddruckers, any day.
if you&apos;re in SoCal, even Polly&apos;s does a really decent burger (not fast food price, tho).

What do you mean, it was small? The Burger is a double patty, the Little Burger a single. Did you get the single? The Little Burger is comparable to other FF chain burgers, as far as size. The Burger is super-sized awesomeness, it&apos;s what I always get, and it is not small.

The only time I was disappointed in 5G was when they forgot my A1. And I was driving home from Chicago - not gonna turn around for A1. But I considered it. : )

If you&apos;re replying to the OP, I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll see you. He posted this more than two years ago, and hasn&apos;t been on the boards in over a year. However, later on in the thread he said that they were small because they were not enough meat (two thin patties, instead of two thick ones) and that he had to have two of the regular (two-patty) burgers and fries in order to fill up. Which is more food than most of us would ever eat in one sitting.

LOL - totally didn&apos;t see the old date. I did think it very odd he complained about the size - what is he, a polar bear? Requires a gazelle-sized meal? : )

 re: JReichert 
I could understand if he didn&apos;t like the fact that the patty was thin, as sometimes I prefer thicker burgers. But to say that TWO 5G burgers, and an order of fries, wasn&apos;t enough to eat?

Yeah, polar bear sounds about right.

 re: Ditdah 
I don&apos;t think most forums care if the OP ever reads it, this post is about more than the OP now. :) I agree, anyone who can&apos;t fill up from a giant 5G burger and fries has way more important issues to deal with. My husband eats quite a lot, usually gets double burgers at most places, but gets the little burger at 5G then we share a small fry and are stuffed. The other night he went big and got the double and was miserable full, saying he&apos;ll never get the fatty again. And he&apos;s not a small guy. If you can eat two of those, please go make daily appointments at the gym and cardiologist. Thanks.

 re: breezymoon 
Well, no, that&apos;s equally weird. No one who is&quot;stuffed&quot;by the small burger and half an order of fries can, by definition, qualify as a big eater.

I&apos;m not saying the OP was right either -- I can&apos;t imagine anyone stuffing down two doubles -- but the small single is hardly gargantuan and would not likely satisfy a big eater or any typical big guy.

Concur... When my wife insists that we do not need two orders of fries anywhere (and that she&apos;ll just have a &apos;few&apos; from the single order), I&apos;ll generally take the path of least resistance and agree that the single order was fine to share and that I&apos;m full enough. Much like when she asks whether I think the female server looks good in that short skirt, and I reply:&quot;What server??&quot;or&quot;It _does_ looks a bit too short, doesn&apos;t it&quot;. :-) In sum, no single order too large; and no skirt too short, for the common man. And I suppose I&apos;m as common as they get :-). And now, I&apos;ll duck...

 re: breezymoon 
Yes, I agree that it&apos;s ok to continue threads even when the OP isn&apos;t around, since (like this one) they become just topic threads that all can read and gain information from. I was just telling JReichert that the OP wasn&apos;t around because his (her?) post seemed to be in response to and included a question directly for the OP. Just trying to be helpful, not telling him not to post. :)

Long time In-N-Out lover. Five Guys is just now developing this area (South OC, CA) so I gave one a try.

I don&apos;t want to come to any permanent conclusions after one visit,, but my first impressions were:

1. Fries are WAAAY better than In-N-Out.
2. Single burger with fried onions, lettuce/tomato (to get a good comparison) at 5 Guys was overcooked and had very little flavor,
3. Price at 5 Guys seemed to be about 30% more for basically the same meal.

Maybe need to bring the 5 Guys fries to In-N-Out. ;o}}}

Had never been to one, thought I would try it, asked for med rare burger, was told only well done. I was hungry so I got one with fries and a soda. About $8.00. Roll was good, everything else no better than McDonalds at twice the price.

Across the street at the diner they grind their own beef. 1 inch thick 8 oz med rare delicious juicy burger w/fries for $7.95.

Haven&apos;t been back to 5 guys since!

FIVE GUYS ONE REDEEMING VALUE

I want to echo a brief comment by johnb above. First, I think Five Guys is tasty but a pretty piss poor value for the money. It&apos;s good but not really good and when you include the fact that you can go to a really high-end burger joint for one or two bucks more it doesn&apos;t even rate.

Here&apos;s the thing though. I live in SoCal and Five Guys is the only place that does classic East Coast boardwalk fries. These are thick cut, skin-on fries fried lightly served vertically in a cup, then completely smothered in malt vinegar. There was a fry stand called Thrasher&apos;s in Rehoboth DE and Ocean City MD (not sure if it was elsewhere) that did this style and it&apos;s one of those touchstone foods from my childhood.

At the Five Guys I&apos;ve been to in Cali I have never once seen anyone but myself use the malt vinegar. It sits on the counter like its a touch to the decor. Maybe it&apos;s the childhood association but I really think this is one of the best ways to eat fries. I&apos;ve had the burger three or four times now but if I happen upon a five guys I just pop in and get the fries. Takes me right back - and those I&apos;ve shared them with really like them too so I&apos;m inclined not to just chalk it up to some weird regional taste thing.

If you go to five guys skip the burger - douse your fries in vinegar and see if you like it.

Thrashers is still open in Rehoboth. There&apos;s a Five Guys directly across the street. I&apos;ll have to do a taste test this summer.

Somewhere above I commented that what I&apos;d like is 5 Guys fries with an In-n-Out burger. I was very disappointed in 5 Guys burgers and In-n-Out fries are OK if you order them crispy but miss the mark overall. We need a 5 In-in-Out Guys around here. ;o]]]

I am a big fan of 5 Guys. I always eat in the store. Recently, people from work went to get 5G for us all for lunch. I&apos;d guess that it took about 10 - 15 mins. from the time they were wrapped in foil until we unwrapped them in the office. Wow. I couldn&apos;t believe how much the quality had degraded compared to eating them as soon as they are made. The difference was striking. Another thing (and I realize this was just one store, and on just one occasion) but they got our toppings completely wrong on this take-out order. That had never happened before. So I won&apos;t be getting 5G take out again.
