Rating for Harry&apos;s Hofbrau in Foster City, CA 
 4 Advertisement 
If we want a quick bite to eat and do not want to go to a fast food restaurant, we usually go to Harry&apos;s Hofbrau Restaurant in Foster City, CA.

When you walk in, there is a feeling that you are in a mountain resort restaurant because the tables are wood, light and dark brown, and the interior has a mountain type motif. The food is arranged in a way that you do not have to travel all around the restaurant to order, in other words, it&apos;s cafeteria style where you order your food quickly and start eating.

I personally, enjoy their pastrami sandwiches, their beef-stew, and their roast beef---I guess this tells you I am a meat person, but I also like their different salads. Watching the servers cut-up the food has shown me how to use a carving knife, which has helped me in carving food at home.

When we are sitting here, we can see they have a least three TVs showing sports without sound, which makes the place quiet while eating. When you finish with a dish, the bus boy is right there to take it away, which gives you a cleaner table to eat on. If you finish your soft drink, water, or coffee, while eating, the bus boy is there asking if you want a refill.

So, with all this service and quietness, it is an enjoyable place to get a quick bite to eat, instead of going to a fast food restaurant.
