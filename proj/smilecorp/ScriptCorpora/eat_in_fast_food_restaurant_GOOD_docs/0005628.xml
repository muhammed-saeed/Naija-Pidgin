SERVICE OPERATIONS
 
 Photo by: Dmitry Kalinovsky 
 Services lie at the hub of economic activity in the United States. Service
 jobs account for almost 80 percent of total U.S. employment. As such, we
 say that the U.S. has a service economy. Within this service economy, the
 term service has several meanings when paired with other words. For
 example, a service firm is defined as one that derives more than 50
 percent of its sales from providing services. RCA&apos;s service
 revenues now exceed its revenues from electronic manufacturing. A service
 package is a bundle of explicit and implicit benefits performed with a
 supporting facility and using facilitated goods. When you eat at a fast
 food restaurant (supporting facility), you may purchase a hamburger
 (facilitating good) that someone else cooked for you (service). The
 service concept is the perception and expectations of the service itself
 in the minds of the customers, employers, shareholders, and lenders. The
 service system is the equipment, layout, and procedures used to provide
 the service and maintain quality and delivery standards. The service
 revolution relates to the shift in the United States to a service economy
 and the proliferation of service automation.

A service operation is an open transformation process of converting inputs
 (consumers) to desired outputs (satisfied consumers) through the
 appropriate application of resources (family, material, labor,
 information, and the consumer as well). More simply, services are economic
 activities that produce time, place, form, or psychological utility. A
 meal in a fast food restaurant saves time. A meal with a date in an
 elegant restaurant with superior service provides a psychological boost.
 Wal-Mart attracts millions of customers because they can find department
 store merchandise, groceries, gasoline, auto service, dry cleaning, movie
 rental, hair styling, eyeglasses and optical services, and nursery items
 all in one place.

The U.S. economy consists of sectors producing goods and services. The
 goods-producing sector consists of manufacturing, construction, and
 extractive industries such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing.
 Different types of services include business services such as consulting,
 banking and financial services; trade services such as retailing,
 maintenance and repair; social/personal services such as restaurants and
 healthcare; public services such as government and education; and
 infrastructure services such as transportation and communication.

SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES

Services are not peripheral activities, but are an integral part of
 society. Except for basic subsistence living, services are an absolute
 necessity for a functional economy and enhancement of the quality of life.
 While an industrial society defines the standard of living by the quantity
 of goods, a service society sees the standard of living through quality of
 life as measured by health, education, and recreation. The central figure
 in this society is the professional who can provide information rather
 than energy or physical strength. In addition, infrastructure services
 (communication and transportation) are seen as essential links between
 sectors of the economy. These infrastructure services are prerequisites
 for the industrialization of an economy, so no advanced society can be
 without them.

The United States, like most societies, began as an agricultural economy.
 As manufacturing became dominant, the economy became centered around
 industry. In the early part of the twentieth century, only 30 percent of
 those employed in the United States were working in services, with the
 rest in industry or agriculture. However, by 1950, half of the workforce
 was employed in services. In 1956, for the first time in the history of
 our industrial society, the number of white-collar workers exceeded the
 number of blue-collar workers. The United States can no longer be
 characterized as an industrial society, but rather as a postindustrial or
 service society. Services now account for approximately 70 percent of the
 national income and 80 percent of the jobs.

A traditional lack of productivity in the service sector is one reason for
 its increasing growth. Generally, productivity in services lags that in
 manufacturing and agriculture. As productivity grows faster in some
 segments (manufacturing and agriculture) these segments will invariably
 shed jobs that will then be picked up by the less productive sector
 (services). Also, during the past four recessions in the United States,
 service-industry employment actually increased as jobs in manufacturing
 decreased or were lost to other countries. This suggests that consumers
 will postpone purchases of hard goods but are not willing to give up
 services such as education, telephone service, banking, healthcare, and
 public services (such as fire and police protection). Finally, countries
 with successful manufacturing histories are the ones that now have the
 ability to create service jobs. There is a ripple effect from
 manufacturing to the creation of services, along with a continual stream
 of newly invented services for sale. Also, services can now be bought in
 greater quantities than in the past.

The fact is that the service sector has replaced the goods-producing
 sector as the economy&apos;s dominant force. This shift in the economic
 locus has variously been called the service sector revolution, the
 postindustrial revolution, the information age, and the technotronic age.

CHARACTERISTICS OF SERVICES

While the variety of services is endless, there are a number of
 characteristics that most services share. Services are generally performed
 with an open-systems perspective, that is, the system is not closed or
 isolated from the consumer as it is in manufacturing. The consumer is said
 to be within the service&apos;s&quot;factory.&quot;There is a high
 degree of customer contact throughout the service process, with the
 customer frequently participating in the process itself. Customer
 participation within the process means that there is simultaneous
 production and consumption; thus, the service cannot be stored for later
 use, possibly as a buffer to absorb fluctuations in demand.

Although services can have tangible (high goods content) and intangible
 (low goods content) attributes, services are generally regarded as
 intangible, that is, you can&apos;t see, feel, or test a
 service&apos;s performance before purchasing it. Hence, reputation is
 extremely important. Since services are intangible, it makes sense that
 they can&apos;t be patented. The intangibility of services sometimes
 makes it difficult for the service firm to identify their product. Is the
 product at a restaurant the food itself, the service, or the atmosphere?
 Another problem, due to intangibility, is the difficulty in measuring
 output. Service output tends to be variable and nonstandard, making
 quality control and productivity measurement a problem. In fact, quality
 control is usually limited to process control. Even this is difficult
 since a high degree of personal judgment by the individual performing the
 service makes homogeneous input a near impossibility. Measures of
 effectiveness and efficiency are also subjective.

Services are time perishable. An empty seat on an airline means that that
 seat on that flight will never be available again. The same holds true for
 an empty hotel room. The empty room will never again be available on that
 particular night. The usefulness of service capacity is
 time-dependent—another reason that services cannot be inventoried
 and held for a later date. This means that services cannot be transferred
 or resold but must be sold directly to the customer. It also means that
 services cannot be mass produced.

Labor intensity is another characteristic of services. In fact, labor is
 usually the most important determinant of service organization
 effectiveness.

Site selection for services is usually dictated by the location of
 consumers. Preferably, services will utilize decentralized facilities
 within close proximity to customers.

Services can also have very weak barriers to entry. Though not true for
 all services, many require little in the way of capital investment,
 proprietary technology, or multiple locations.

CLASSIFYING SERVICE FIRMS

Service firms can be classified according to their various
 characteristics. This allows clarification of the relationships between
 firms and customers and of potential strategies for competition.

A simple classification of services is by capital intensity and labor
 skills. This allows services to be grouped into equipment-based services
 and people-based services. Equipment-based services can then be subdivided
 into automatic services such vending machines and automated car washes;
 services monitored by unskilled labor, such as dry cleaning and movie
 theaters; and services operated by skilled labor, such as excavating,
 airlines, and computer services. People-based services are subdivided into
 those utilizing unskilled labor, such as lawn care, security guards, and
 janitorial service; those utilizing skilled labor, such as appliance
 repair, plumbing, catering, electrical work, and auto body repair; and
 professional services such as law, medicine, accounting, and consulting.

Though generally thought of as a manufacturing tool, Wheelwright and
 Hayes&apos;s product-process matrix also provides a basis for
 classifying services. This framework groups firms based on their position
 on the product life cycle and product structure and their stage within the
 process life cycle and process structure, yielding the classifications of
 project, job shop, batch, repetitive-assembly, and continuous-flow
 manufacturing. Projects include professional services in which the process
 is characterized by a number of interrelated, well-defined activities,
 accomplished in a sequence. Doctors, lawyers, and architects typically
 manage a number of projects. Job shops and batches define services that
 are tailored to the customers&apos;specifications. Repetitive assembly
 has a line flow, as do services that can be standardized and divided into
 routine tasks such as university registration, license renewal, and
 military medical examinations.

Richard Chase has argued that service delivery systems can be improved by
 separating them into high- and low-contact operations and managing them
 accordingly. High-contact services must have their operations near the
 customer and must be able to interact well with the public, since quality
 is often subjective (in the eye of the beholder). Output is variable, so
 wages have to be time-based. Low-contact services can place their
 operations near their suppliers, labor, or transportation, since the
 customer is not 
 in the environment. The workforce is required to have only technical
 skills, as work would be performed on a customer surrogate. This also
 allows wages to be output-based.

Roger Schmenner expanded this concept by including the degree of labor
 intensity and customization with the contact (interaction) classification.
 Service firms with low interaction/customization utilize standard
 operating procedures and pay less attention to physical surroundings.
 Firms with high interaction/customization strive to maintain quality,
 react to customer intervention and gain employee loyalty. Low
 labor-intensive firms concentrate on capital decisions, technological
 advances, maintaining a high utilization rate, and scheduling service
 delivery. Highly labor-intensive services emphasize workload scheduling,
 managing growth, hiring, training, and employee welfare.

In his 1986 article,&quot;How Can Service Businesses Survive and
 Prosper,&quot;Shemenner provided a framework for understanding services
 and utilizing them strategically. This framework, which resembles
 Wheelwright and Hayes&apos;s Product-Process Matrix and is used in
 similar fashion, is called the Service Process Matrix. Within this matrix
 service firms are classified by their position on a graph with two
 dimensions. The horizontal dimension is the degree of labor intensity,
 which is defined as the ratio of labor cost to capital cost. The vertical
 dimension of the matrix measures the degree of customer interaction and
 customization. Firms that have a high degree of labor intensity and a high
 degree of interaction/customization are termed professional services.
 Service firms with a high degree of labor intensity but a low degree of
 interaction/customization are called mass services. Low labor intensity
 and a high degree of interaction/customization characterize the service
 shop, while firms with both low labor intensity and a low degree of
 interaction/customization constitute a service factory.

As with the product-process matrix, firms on the service matrix have
 strategic implications dependent upon where they fit within the matrix.
 Again like the product process matrix, service firms are generally more
 effective if they stay in close proximity to a diagonal running from the
 upper-left corner to the lower-right corner of the matrix.

SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING

Theodore Levitt, in his classic article,&quot;Production-Line Approach
 to Service,&quot;describes how service managers can design their
 operations to achieve the economics of production. The design and
 conversion processes of services are sometimes called the&quot;technical core.&quot;By insulating the technical core such that
 the customer has essentially no personal contact with the service
 providers, the business can operate more efficiently. The technical core
 can be insulated by restricting the offerings (fast food restaurants have
 very limited menus); customizing at delivery (as computers are);
 structuring the service in such a way that the customer has to go where
 the service is offered (like banks); trying to incorporate self-service so
 that customers can shop at their own pace; and separating services that
 lend themselves to automation (ATMs and vending machines). By insulating
 the technical core one can essentially apply to services what has been
 learned in manufacturing, namely standardization and mass delivery. Levitt
 uses the example of McDonald&apos;s to provide a picture of a service
 that utilizes manufacturing techniques to the point that the end product
 results in what he terms the&quot;technocratic hamburger.&quot;McDonald&apos;s makes use of a limited menu, division of labor, a
 standardized product (food preparers at McDonald&apos;s have little or
 no discretion when it comes to making the product), task grouping to allow
 specialized skills, and an assembly-line approach, all applied to the
 technical core that is insulated (away from the ordering and seating area)
 from the consumer.

LOCATION AND LAYOUT IN SERVICES

Location selection in services is a macro decision, while site selection
 is a micro decision. As with manufacturing, service location decisions
 involve such variables as expansion, impact on the environment, and
 governmental regulation. However, services also factor in such variables
 as access, visibility, traffic, competition and parking.

Service layout requirements are somewhat different from manufacturing but
 the same terminology is used. In both services and manufacturing we find
 the fixed-position layout, process layout, and product, or in this case,
 service-based layout. The fixed-position layout is the simplest. In this
 situation, the customer remains in one place throughout the service as
 materials and labor are brought to that location. If the customer or item
 being serviced must remain in one location, the service must relocate
 there, as with pool cleaning, landscaping, or home decorator consulting.
 In other cases, the nature of the equipment dictates a fixed position.
 Examples include dialysis machines, beauty salons, or psychiatric
 counseling.

In process layouts, similar machines, such as hair dryers in a beauty
 salon, are grouped together to produce batches of services (much the same
 as in the batch or disconnected line-flow process of the product-process
 matrix). University classrooms and movie theaters provide excellent
 examples of a process layout in a service environment.

If the equipment required to serve the customer is sequentially arranged
 according to the steps of the service process, the layout is said to be
 service-based 
 (or product layout). As in manufacturing, the product layout can be
 continuous (without interruption) and is usually lacking in flexibility.
 Drivers license renewal, registration for university classes, and
 cafeterias are examples of a service or product layout.

SERVICE OPERATIONS STRATEGY

As with manufacturing, service operations require a strategic approach.
 Metters, King-Metters, Pullman and Walton describe the strategic planning
 process as a hierarchy consisting of strategic positioning, service
 strategy, and tactical execution

STRATEGIC POSITIONING.

Strategic positioning involves first defining the firm&apos;s target
 market. In other words, what is the set of customers the firm seek to
 serve. Next, the firm must determine its core competence or what will
 distinguish it from other service firms, i.e., cost leadership,
 differentiation, or focus. At this point, the firm then must make
 decisions regarding its mission and high-level goals and objectives.

SERVICE STRATEGY.

At the service strategy level, the service firm must define its service
 concept, operating system and service delivery system. The service
 strategy links the firm&apos;s strategic position with tactical
 execution. The firm begins by determining its competitive priorities, and
 its order winners and order qualifiers. Competitive priorities are the
 characteristics of the firm or things that it does better than other
 service firms (e.g., low cost, quality, service, or flexibility). The
 firm&apos;s competitive priority(s) must be both an order qualifier and
 an order winner. The order qualifier is a characteristic that the service
 must possess in order to compete in the market. If the firm lacks this
 then the consumer will not even consider purchasing the firm&apos;s
 service. The order winner is the characteristic that will cause the
 consumer to purchase the firm&apos;s service over its competitors. The
 service concept then is the set of competitive priorities that the target
 market values.

The operating strategy describes how the firm&apos;s different functions
 (marketing, finance, and operations) will support the service concept. If
 the firm&apos;s order winning competitive priority is quality, what will
 operations do to ensure quality of the service and how will marketing
 promote this characteristic?

The service delivery system defines the components of the system necessary
 to execute the service concept. Examples of the needed variables are
 capacity requirements, quality management systems, and management
 policies. Each of these should support the firm&apos;s competitive
 priorities so that the firm is clearly distinct from its competitors.

TACTICAL EXECUTION.

Finally, the firm approaches tactical execution issues. Tactical execution
 involves the day-to-day activities required to function and support the
 service strategy. Included are capacity management, facility location,
 inventory management, facility layout, supplier selection, operations
 scheduling, staffing, and productivity improvement.

Decisions that are made in the above strategic planning process are
 heavily influenced by their position on Marc McCluskey&apos;s service
 maturity model. This model divides service maturity into four stages:
 
Stage 1: Baseline service—the focus is mainly on responding to
 requests in a timely manner.

Stage 2: Operational efficiency—the focus is on cost reduction

Stage 3: Customer support excellence—the focus is on efficiency

Stage 4: The focus is on changing the concept of service and growing
 market opportunity
 
McCluskey notes that most firms are still in stage 1, moving into the
 second.

AUTOMATION IN SERVICES

A recent phenomenon in services is the application of automation. Often
 services lag manufacturing and agriculture in productivity. One way to
 improve productivity in services is to remove the customer from the
 process as much as possible by whatever means possible. One way is the use
 of automation. Many of these applications are things we see everyday but
 give little consideration; most were introduced in fairly recent times.

Financial services have seen the proliferation of ATMs and the use of
 electronic funds transfer. Education makes use of PCs, audio-visual
 equipment, calculators, translation computers and electronic library
 cataloguing. Restaurants and supermarkets make wholesale use of optical
 scanning. If you have been to Las Vegas or an airport you have probably
 stood on a moving sidewalk. Hotels utilize electronic reservation systems,
 electronic locks, electronic wake-up calls, and message services. Other
 fields such as government, communication, healthcare, and the leisure
 industry have all benefited from the automation of services. As technology
 advances, we are likely to see more and more services being automated as
 service productivity increases.
