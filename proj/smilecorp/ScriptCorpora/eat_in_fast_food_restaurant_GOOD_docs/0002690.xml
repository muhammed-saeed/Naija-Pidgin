Poutine vs. Freedom Fries: Americans are Fatter Than Canadians
 by Briana Rognlin | 10 Comments | Share a Tip 
 

Plenty of countries are known for their svelte, attractive populations: Canada isn’t one of them. But despite the country’s deep love for poutine (french fries drowned in gravy and topped with cheese curds, pictured above) and Nanaimo bars, they’re still not as fat as Americans . According to new info from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only one quarter of Canadians are obese, compared with one third of Americans.

The data, taken from a three year time period ending in 2009, shows that the difference is biggest between women in the two countries: 24% of Canadian women are obese, while a full 36% of American women have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above. (The difference between males is smaller: 27% of Canadian men and 33% of American men are obese.)

Why such a big difference between countries that are so close? It could be a more active Northern lifestyle, or that Canadians are eating more greens with their poutine. What do you think keeps Canadians slimmer? Sound off in the comments section, below:

I’m from Montreal, most people I know don’t eat poutine that often. The most often I’ve seen someone eat poutine is around once or twice a month. Also, I live in downtown Montreal. I’ve lived 2 years in Calgary (where the lifestyle is closer to the american lifestyle) and the difference is really big. In Calgary most people use cars to go where-ever they have to go, here in montreal, (downtown anyway) most people walk and take the subway, because everything is very close. As you get further from downtown, there are more overweight people. Also the portion sizes is a MAJOR difference between Canada and U.S. And prices are different too. In U.S. a simple burger is twice the size and half the price of the same burger in Canada. When I compare myself to people around me, either at work or at school, I’d be in the“needs to work out more”category. But when I went to Florida this summer, I was in the“skinny”category. I think Canadians might not have very healthy eating habits, but we still have healthy meal portions. That’s what makes the biggest difference.

Actually, you really don’t have to look very long to find plenty of morbidly obese people in Canada. In the downtown areas of big cities people tend to be thin, but once you get to to the suburbs or small towns, you could very well be in the Deep South. The official numbers are one out of every four Canadians is overweight, as opposed to one out of every three Americans–a real difference, but not quite as big as some of my self-satisfied fellow Canadians would have it.

Where are these small towns that look like the Deep South? Canada’s a pretty big place so it’s not really fair to throw out a stereotyped opinion stated as fact. Also, um…one in four is the same as one quarter and one in three is the same as one third…as stated above. You may be a skinny Canadian but your reading comprehension and math may need a little work.

Whenever I visit our Southern neighbors, I am absolutely astounded by the portion sizes that are often up to 4 sizes larger than what I’m used to in Canada. Even look at the size of that poutine container- it’s much smaller than what you’d get if you asked for an order of fries in the states. Last time I was in the US with friends we just started ordering a‘single’portion for all 4 of us, and still always had leftovers XD

Ski hill poutine is the best…. hmmm I havent had one yet this season lol. Must ski/snowboard first to burn all the calories :)

I live in Quebec and love poutine but I rarely eat it. Why? It’s really bad for you, I usually eat it at a ski hill or on special occasions. It’s really like a treat to me. (I guess I also eat healthily most of the time anyways.)

I also rarely see morbidly obese people here…

I love a poutine just as much as any other fellow Canadian. However, despite this possibly being the best food invention of all time (okay, maybe not really), I only enjoy this tasty treat maybe twice a year at most, preferrably in the winter at a ski lodge in Quebec…yumm.

I find there is not as much fast food restaurants here in Canada (at least in Ottawa), but maybe I am biased since I don’t really eat that much fast food to begin with.

Interesting. I’m guessing most Americans eat french fries more often than twice a year, so you could be onto something.

I wonder if Canadians tend to eat at home more or cook more. So many Americans eat prepared/packaged foods, which tends to be less nutritious/more fattening (even if it’s not technically from a fast food restaurant). Or maybe you just burn off lots of calories trudging through that snow up there!

Great. Now I want poutine. And I don’t even particularly like it, just that picture, and it being so close to lunchtime, totally set me on the craving train!

Sorry! I’m sure there is poutine somewhere in New York, if you look hard enough…
