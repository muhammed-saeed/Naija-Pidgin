		Lifestyle Spending Table 








 
          A Lifestyle Fact To Ponder: 
 
 Estimates of revenue from video games for the year 2000 were $7.98 billion. Estimates of revenue for the year 2010 were $19.66 billion. (Figures were provided by The NPD Group.) 

      Number 17 and Nayeli E Rodriguez, &quot;Exactly How Much Are The Times A-Changin&apos;?,&quot; Newsweek, July 26, 2010, p. 56. 

           A Lifestyle Thought For Action: 

 In 2000, people spent $7.98 billion on video games. By 2010, people spent $19.66 billion on video games. Somehow, people “found” an additional $11.68 billion a year in 2010. That amount could have stopped child deaths and evangelized the world. Why aren’t we getting organized about Jesus’ priorities? For an idea to mobilize the church to more missions, see empty tomb’s Mission Match®Discipleship Tree® . 

      

           A Call To Action: 

 &quot;A final word: Be strong with the Lord’s mighty power. Put on all of God’s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies and tricks of the Devil. For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world, and against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms. Use every piece of God’s armor to resist the enemy in the time of evil, so that after the battle you will still be standing firm. Stand your ground, putting on the sturdy belt of truth and the body armor of God’s righteousness. For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News, so that you will be fully prepared. In every battle you will need faith as your shield to stop the fiery arrows aimed at you by Satan. Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Pray at all times and on every occasion in the power of the Holy Spirit. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all Christians everywhere.&quot;
