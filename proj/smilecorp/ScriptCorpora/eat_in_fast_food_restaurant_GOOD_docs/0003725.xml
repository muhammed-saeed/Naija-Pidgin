A Preliminary List of North American Species of Cyperus, with 

Descriptions of new Forms. 

By N. L. Britton. 

(A) Sub-genus Pycreus, Beauv. 

* Umbel sitnple or capitate, rarely slightly conipoiind. 

t Superficial cells of the achenium oblong. 

1. Cyperus Jlavescens,!^. Canada to Texas throughout east- 
ern North America ; also in northern Mexico, Brazil, southern 
Europe, northern Africa and western Asia. 

t t Superficial cells of the achenium quadrate. 

2. C. diandrus, Torrey. Throughout eastern North 
America, extending westward to Arkansas and New Mexico. 
(Fendler, No. 869.) 

Var. castaneiis, Torrey. {C. Elliottianiis, Roem. and Schultes, 
Mant. ii., p. 100.) With the type. I cannot agree with Mr. C. 
B. Clarke, (Journ. Linn. Soc, xxi., p. 65) in regarding this plant 
as a distinct species under the name C. rivularis, Kunth. The 
varieties eliLta and dcpanpcrata which he proposes (1. c.) are, in 
my opinion, but forms of the variable C. diandrus. There is 
still another form, characterized by elongated, spikelets, which 
has been collected by Hunter in Lincoln Co., N. C, and by Leg- 
gett at Summit, N. J. 

Var. CAPITATUS, n. var. Inflorescence a single capitate cluster 
appearing somewhat lateral ; involucre of one or two elongated 
leaves with one or two bracts; glumes generally brown-mar- 
gined. Texas and northern Mexico j:o California. Here 1 in- 
clude the var. castaneiis of Watson in Botany of California, ii., p. 
214 ; No. 1949 of C. Wright&apos;s New Mexican Collection, and No. 
49a of Dr. Palmer&apos;s Chihuahuan Collection&apos; of 1885. 

3. C. bipartitus, Torrey. New Orleans, La., (Dr. Ingalls 
in Torrey Herbarium.) This appears to be distinct, but more 
specimens are needed to establish its relationship ; it may be but 
a single-spiked form or variety ot&quot; C. diandrus. 

4. C. Nuttallii, Eddy in Sprang. Neue Entdeck., i., p. 
240; Torrey. In salt meadows along the Atlantic and Gulf 
coasts (Curtiss, N. A. Plants, 3050.) For synonomysee Torrey, 
Ann. Lye, iii., p. 252, C. Cleaveri, Torrey, is but a depauper- 
ate, single spiked form, of this species. 



206 

5- C. Olfersianus, Kunth. Umbel very simple, I to few- 
rayed ; heads composed of few straw-colored spikelets ; achenium 
oblong, its surface marked with quadrate cells ; otherwise re- 
sembling C. flavescens. Plaquemines Co., La., (A. B. Langlois, 
1882); Mexico, West Indies and eastern South America. 

6. C. polystachyiis, Rottb. New Orleans, (Torrey Herba- 
rium ; an old specimen.) Widely distributed in tropical regions, 

Var, leptostachyus, Bceckl. {C. niicrodontiis, and C. 
Gatesii, Torrey, C. Texensis, Steud.) Virginia to Florida (Cur- 
tiss, N. A. Plants, No. 3049, part), and Texas, (E. Hall, 6^6^ 

7. C. leucolepis, Carey, MS., fide Clarke 1. c, p. 61, (not 
of Boeckl. ; C. divergens, Chapm., not of HBK.) Quincy, Flor- 
ida. Related to C. piimihcs, L., of India. 

8 C. unioloides, R. Br., var. bromoides, Clarke. Spikelets 
much larger than in any of the foregoing species, straw-colored, 
Cienaga, Los Angeles Co., Cal., (J. C. Oliver in Gray Herba- 
rium) ; Mexico, West Indies and South America ; the type in 

Australia. 

* * Umbel compound. 

9. C. flavicomns, Vahl, Torrey, Ann. Lye, iii., 253, Boeck- 
eler, not of Michaux, which, according to Mr. Clarke (1. c, p. 
71), is C. strigosus, L. Virginia to Florida; also in Brazil. 

10. C. Hochstetteri, Nees. (C, flavicomus, Torrey, Bot. Mex. 
Bound. Survey.) Glumes dark reddish brown ; achenium broadly 
ellipsoidal, twice or three times the size of that of the foregoing 
species, which it otherwise resembles. Louisiana (Hale) ; Texas 
and New Mexico (C. Wright, No. 1965) ; also in tropical Amer- 
ica, Australia, India and Africa, 

(B) Sub genus JUNCELLUS, Griseb. 

11. C. IcBvigatiis, L. Southern California (Brewer, Lem- 
mon, Wright, Parish, No. 1050.) Widely distributed in tropical 

regions. 

(C) Sub-genus EUCYPERUS, Clarke, 

Section i. Aristati, Kunth, 
* Spikelets digitate. 

12. C. amabilis, Vahl. (C aureus, aurantiacus and oligo^ 
stachyus, HBK; C. glareosus,\-A€b&apos;Ci\?) Sanoita Valley, south 
crn Arizona, (Rothrock, No. 599, in Expl, and Surveys West of 



207 

lOOth Meridian, under C. Niittallii) ; Mexico, (Dr. Palmer, No. 
49b, 1885); also in the West Indies, South America, eastern 
India and Africa. 

* * Spikelets in dense terniinal clusters. 

13. C. aristatiis, Rottb. {C. injiexus, Muhl ; C. confertus, 
Chapm., S. Flora, not of Swartz.) Throughout North Amer- 
ica, but local. (E. Hall, PI. Oreg., 557, and PI. Tex., 677.) Dr. 
Chapman&apos;s specimens from South Florida, marked C. confertus, 
differ mainly in the reddish-brown glumes, which is the charac- 
ter given by Clarke (1. c, p. 92), for his forma versicolor. The 
species is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions, 
not, however, occurring in Europe. 

14. C. sesleroidcs, HBK. Sanoita Valley, southern Arizona, 
(Rothrock, No. 614, P^xpl. and Surveys West of lOOth Meri- 
dian) ; also in Mexico, Hartweg, No. 256 ; Liebmann ; Parry and 
Palmer, Nos. 910, 911 and 911^; Chihuahua, Dr. E. Palmer, 
No. 49^, 1885, named by me C. spectabilis^ which appears to be 
a totally different plant. Specimens from various other Mexican 
localities in the Gray Herbarium very closely resembling those 
here cited are determined as C. divergens, HBK., which nearly 
related, if not identical species Bceckeler and Clarke refer to 
C. spectabilis, Schreb. • Following these authorities I was led into 
error in my determination of Dr. Palmer&apos;s plant. 

Section 2. Conipressi, Kunth. 

15. C. conipressus, L. Maryland and southward along the 
Atlantic and Gulf coasts to Texas (Curtiss, N. A. Plants, No. 
3026; E. Hall, PI. Tex., 682); also in ballast at Camden and 
Philadelphia ; Mexico and Central America and in the warmer 
portions of Asia and Africa. 

16. C. Rnsbyi, Britton in Bull. Corn Bot. Club, xi., p. 29. 
Near Silver City, New Mexico, Dr. H. H. Rusby, 1880. 

17. C. Buckley I, Britton. Valley of the Lower Rio Grande, 
(Buckley); rocky hills near Chihuahua (Pringle, Plantae Mex., 
1885, No. 311); Indian Terr. (E. Palmer, 347). 

18. C. Schzveinitzii, Torrey. Western Pennsylvania and 
Canada to Texas and Arizona (Lemmon, No. 2905) ; westward 
to the Pacific coast, extending north to Oregon (Geyer) ; also in 
Mexico, (Parry and Palmer, 907). 



208 

Var, DEBILIS, n. var. Much smaller and more slender, about 
6-8 inches high ; inflorescence very simple ; spikelets few flowered ; 
glumes blunt, strongly nerved. Arizona and New Mexico (C. 
Wright, No. 1944 ; Rusby, No. 430, Coll. of 1880) ; also in Mex- 
ico (Bourgeau, No. 529.) 

19. C. Fendlerianus, Boeckl. Texas, Arizona and New Mex- 
ico (Fendler, No. 865 ; C. Wright, No. 1945 ; Rusby; Matthews; 
also Hall and Harbour, Rocky Mountain Flora, No. 584,) 

Section 3. Viscosi, Clarke. 

20. C. viscosiis, Alton. (C trachynotus, Torrey.) Florida 

to New Mexico (Nos. 1943 and 704, C. Wright; No. 15 15, Mex. 

Bound. Survey); Mexico, West Indies and northern South 

America. 

Section 4. Liisuloidei, Kunth. 

21. C. Luzulcs, Rottb., var. UMBELLULATUS, n. var. {C. 
vegetiis, Pursh, Muhlenberg, Elliott, Torrey, Chapman,&amp;c., not 
of Willd. ; C. virens, Gray, Manual, not of Michaux ; C. dis- 
tinctus and pseiido-distinctiis, Steud.) ; Delaware (Canby) to 
Florida (E. Palmer, No. 586, 1874), and westward through the 
Gulf States to Texas (Lindheimer, No. 201), the Indian Territory 
and Arkansas. Differs from the type mainly in the compound in- 
florescence. Specimens received from Mr. Ravenel, collected at 
Aiken, S. C, closely approach the type, which occurs in Mexico, 
the West Indies and South America, (Mart. Herb. Flor. Brazil, 
No. 245.) 

22. C. vii^ens, Michx. North Carolina to Florida (Curtiss, 
N. A. Plants, No. 3062), and westward through the Gulf States 
to Texas (E. Hall, No. 680) ; also in Mexico and Guatemala, 
(fide Hemsley) ; California (vide Watson, Bot. Cal., ii., p. 214.) 

23. C. Siirinamensis, Rottb. {^C. Drununondi&apos;i, Torrey); 
Florida, (Curtiss. N. A. Plants, No. 3032) to Texas ; in ballast 
grounds, Camden, N. J., (Parker); also in Mexico, the West In- 
dies and South America. « 

24. C. ochraceus, Vahl. {C. f or mos us, Vahl (?), vide Torrey 
in Ann. Lye, iii., p. 269; C. aureus {J), Britton in Bull. Torr. 
Bot. Club, xi., p. 85 ) Abbeville, La. (Langlois, distributed as 
No. 855c); Texas (Buckley), and in the West Indies and Mex- 
ico (Botteri, Nos. 739, 740); Mex. Bound Survey, No. 15 19. 



209 

25- C. serrulatus, Watson. Placer Co., Cal., G. R. Vasey ; 
Alta, Cal., Pringle ; Sacramento, M. E. Jones, Flor. Cal., 3530. 

26. C.reflexns,V-a\\\. (C r;//^j-&lt;:^;w, Torr. and Hook.) Texas, 
(Drummond ; E. Hall, No. 679, in part ; Wright ; Nealley.) 
Specimens recently received from Mr. Nealley show that the 
scales are not always red, and that the spikelets may be as many 
as 30-flowered. 

27. C. cyrtolepis, Torn and Hook. Texas Drummond, 
Wright, Mex. Bound. Survey, No. 1520, E. Hall, 678 in part, 
Buckley, Reverchon) ; Camp Grant, Arizona, (Rothrock, Exp. 
and Surv. W. of looth Merid., 390); Indian Terr., (Palmer 351.) 

Var. DENTICARINATUS. {C. rufesce7is, var. denticarinatns, 
Pritton in Bull. Torn Bot. Club, xi., p. 85.) After a re-examin- 
ation of Mr. Buckley&apos;s specimens from the valley of the lower 
Rio Grande, I am convinced that they belong rather to this 
species than to C. ricfescens. 

28. C. acumijiatus, Torr. and Hook. Illinois and Tennes- 
see to Louisiana, Kansas and Arizona ; also collected by Howell 
(No. 567) along the Columbia River in Oregon, and by J. W. 
Congdon in Tulare Co., Cal. A form of this species collected by 
E. Hall at Hempstead, Texas (PI. Tex., 679), has dense heads of 
many spikelets. 

Section 5. Haspani, Kunth. 

29. C. Haspan, L. Virginia, North Carolina (Curtis, Can- 
by), to Florida (Curtiss, N. A. Plants, No. 3041), and westward 
to Texas (E. Hall, No. 683) ; also occurring in Mexico, the West 
Indies, South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. 

30. C. dentatus, Torrey. Cumberland Co., Maine (J. Blake), 
Rhode Island and northern Nev/ York (Leggett), to South Caro- 
lina, mainly near the Atlantic coast, but extending westward to 
West Virginia (Mertz.) 

31. C. Lecontei, Torrey. Florida (Curtiss, N. A. Plants, 
No. 3045) to Louisiana. 

Section 6. Fiisci, Kunth. 

32. C. laterifloriis, Torrey. East of Santa Cruz, Sonora, 
(C. Wright, No. 1950.) Not since collected. The species is 
nearly allied to C. difformis, L., of the tropical regions of the 
Old World, and may be the same. 



210 

33- C Iria, L. Santee Canal. South Carolina (Ravenel ; 
Curtiss, N. A. Plants, No. 3043.) According to Dr. Chapman 
it was probably introduced from eastern Asia, where, as elsewhere 
in warm-temperate countries, it is a noxious weed in rice fields. 

34. C. fuscus,\^. In ballast sand, Camden (Parker); Revere 
Beach, Mass. (H. A. Young, in Gray Herbarium.) Adventive. 

Section 7. Glomerati, Clarke. 

35. C. cepJialantJius, Torn and Hook. Texas (Drummond, 
3d Coll., No. 445) ; Louisiana (Carpenter, Langlois.) 

&apos;^G. C. spectabilis, Schreb. Texas (Drummond, in Calcutta 
Herbarium, fide Clarke, 1. c, p. 142.) Arizona, (Rothrock, 600 
and 601, in Expl. and Surveys W. of lOOth Meridian.) (See No. 
14 of this List.) 

37. C. distans, L. Eastern North Carolina (Gerald Mc- 
Carthy, 1885.) The species was recorded from the same region 
by Pursh (Flor. Amer., Sept., i., p. 53) and its rediscovery by 
Mr. McCarthy confirms Pursh&apos;s statement that it grows &quot;in wet 
woods, Carolina and Georgia.&quot; It is widely distributed in trop- 
ical countries. 

Section 8. Corymbosi, Kunth. 

* Culm jointed, leafless. 

38. C. articiilattis, L. South Carolina and Florida (Curtiss, 
N. A. Plants, No. 3024) to Texas along the Gulf Coast (E. Hall, 
No. 703.) In all tropical regions. 

Van coiiglomeratiis, Britton. Valley of the lower Rio Grande 
(Buckley.) 

A form of this species with the spikelets greatly elongated 
has been collected by Mr. Nealley in Texas. 

* * Culms leafy. 

t Perennial l)y tuberiferous stolons. 

39. C rotuiidiis, L. North Carolina to Florida (Curtiss, N. 
A. Plants, No. 3055) and Texas (E. Hall, 684); also in ballast 
grounds at Jersey City (Brown), Philadelphia and Camden 
(Parker), and at Port Eads, La., (Langlois) ; throughout the 
warmer regions of the globe. For synonomy see Clarke, 1. c, 
p. 162. 

40. C esculentjis, L. {C. pJiymatodes, Muhl. ; C rcpens, 



&apos;211 

Ell.) New Brunswick (Fowler) and Wisconsin to Florida (Cur- 
tiss, N. A. Plants, No, 3052) and Texas throughout eastern 
North America ; westward to California and extending north- 
ward along the Pacific coast to Alaska (J. O, Rainer, 187 1) ; also 
in Mexico, South America, southern Europe to the Cape of Good 
Hope, and in Australia. 

Var. inacrostachyiiSy Boeckl. (C hitescens, Torr. and Hook, 
Ann. Lye, iii., 433). Florida (Chapman), Texas (C. Wright, 
1849, No. 705 ; Drummond, 3d Coll., No. 452), San Diego, Cal., 
(Orcutt, No. 1 3 14.) 

Var. ANGUSTISPICATUS, n. van Spikelets narrowly linear, 
about one line wide and three-fourths of an inch long; a well- 
marked form. Kentucky (Short), Missouri (H. Eggert), Wash- 
ington, D C, (Vasey), Lexington Co., S. C, (J. Donnell Smith.) 

Var. Hermann:. {^C. Hervianni, Buckley; C. pJiymatodes, 
var. Hermanni, Watson). Kern River, Cal., (Blake, in Torrey 
Herbarium) ; Bank of San Joaquin (Lemmon, Flor. Cal., 1509.) 
41. C. HalLII, n. sp. Culm triangular, 2 to 3 feet high ; 
leaves elongated, 2 to 3 lines wide ; involucre of several leaves, 
one of them elongated far beyond the others and reaching a 
length of a foot or more ; umbel more or less compound, of 5 or 
6 elongated rays and several shorter ones; involucels setaceous; 
spikelets linear, 9 to 15-flowered, arranged in loose heads; 
glumes ovate, acute, strongly 7 to 9-nerved, dark reddish-brown, 
with lighter colored margins and apices; achenium triangular, 
linear. Rootstocks scaly. 

Texas (E. Hall, PI. Tex., No. 685, distributed as C. pJiyuia- 
iodes, var.) ; valley of the lower Rio Grande (Buckley) ; Indian 
Territory (E. Palmer, No. 353). 

t t Annual or perennial ; roots fibrous, but stems often liard and corm-like at 

the base. 

42. C. strigostis, L. [C. Micha?Lviamis, Schultes, not of 
Torrey, fide Boeckeler ; C. flavicomns, Michx., not of Vahl ; C. 
stenolepis, Watson, Bot. Cal., not of Torrey.) Canada and Min- 
nesota to Florida (Curtiss, N. A. Plants No. 1820, distributed as 
C. stenolepis?) and Texas, throughout eastern North America; 
also in California. Among the many forms of this variable 
species I think the following may be distinguished : 



212 

Var. robiistior, Kunth, Enum., ii., p. 88. Spikelets large, 
elongated. lO to 25 -flowered. With the type. 

Var. capitatns, Boeckl, Liniiaea, xxxvi., p. 347. Inflores- 
cence of several capitate clusters, rays short. Indiana (Dr. 
Clapp, 1838); St. Louis, Mo., (Engelmann) ; Illinois (Dr. 
Schneck); Massachusetts (Morong) ; Camden, N. J., (Martin- 
dale) ; Texas, (Bigelow.) 

Var. COMPOSITUS, n. var. {C. strigosus, var. Torrey, Ann. 
Lye, iii., p. 262.) Umbel compound ; spikelets one-third to 
one-half inch long, 4 to 5 -flowered. Astoria, Long Island 
(Leggett) ; Pennsylvania and New Jersey to Alabama. 

Var. GRACILIS, n. var. Slender, leaves shorter than the 
culm, umbel of 1-3 short rays, bearing few, linear, spreading 
spikelets. Valley of the Lower Rio Grande (Buckley) ; Fayette- 
ville. Ark., (Harvey.) 

Var. ELONGATUS. {C. Michauxianus, var. {}) elongatus, Tor- 
rey, Ann. Lye, iii., p. 432 (?). Rays much elongated, bearing 
single, capitate clusters. North Carolina (Curtis, in Torrey 
Herb.) The originals of Dr. Torrey &apos;s variety were collected by 
Drummond in Texas, but there are no specimens from there in 
his herbarium, and I have no means of knowing if they are the 
same as the one from North Carolina on which the present variety 
is based. 

43. C. stenolepis, Torrey. North Carolina to Florida and 
Texas. 

44. C. setigerus, T&lt;yrr. and Hook. (Including C. Intescens, 
Torrey, Bot. Mex. Bound. Survey, p. 227, and Herbarium.) 
Texas and New Mexico (C. Wright, No. 705 ; Buckley ; Bigelow, 
and Herb. Berland. Texano-Mexicanum, Nos. 2410 and 980.) 
I can see no reason for keeping the two species separate, and Dr. 
Torrey states (1. c.) that his C. Intescens is probably too close to 
C. setigerus. 

45. C. sp/iacelatus, Rottb. Southern Nevada (Lieut.

Cerastium arvense, L., and its North American Varieties. 
By Arthur Hollick and N. L. Britton. 

Plates LXIII-LXV. 

While botanizing on Staten Island, New York, during the 
past ten or twelve years, our attention was frequently attracted 
by a Cerastium, which grows abundantly at many places on the 
serpentine hills, and in no other parts of the Island. This plant 
agrees in general with the description of C. oblongifolhun, 
Torrey, in the Flora of the State of New York, and yet it exhib- 
its such a variety of forms that we were led to collect a large 
number of specimens and memoranda for comparison. The 
further the subject was investigated the more interesting it 
became to us, and finally resulted in the study of not only this 
plant, but of allied forms from other places. Our studies have 
resulted in the conclusion that the Staten Island plants are more 
properly to be regarded as a variety of C. arvense, L., and that 
many other American forms of Cerastiwn are to be referred to 
varieties of this species, as modified by climate, soil, etc. 

In addition to specimens in our own collections and those in 
the herbarium of Columbia College, others from the following 
herbaria have been kindly placed at our disposal : Harvard 
University, United States Department of Agriculture, Academy 
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and Torrey Botanical Club. 
In addition to these, we have received specimens and notes from 
Prof T. C. Porter, Mr. C. E. Smith, Mr. W. M. Canby, Mr. J. M. 
Macoun, Dr. J. C. Arthur, Prof S. M. Tracy, and others. 

The following is our proposed arrangement of the North 
American forms of the species : 

Cerastium arvense, L. Leaves hnear or narrowly lanceo- 
late ; those of the stem distant ; stem and leaves hairy or nearly 



46 

smooth ; bracts small ; capsule equaling or somewhat exceeding 
the calyx. (Plate LXlV., f. I.)

near Alexandria, Va. (A. H. Curtiss) ; Washington, D. C. (Vasey, 
Ward); Montgomery Co., Md. (J. D. Smith); Newcastle Co., 
Del. (Canby, Commons); Lancaster Co., Penn. (Porter); eleven 
miles west of Philadelphia (C. E.Smith); and abundant on the 
hills of Staten Island, N. Y. ; also extending westward to the 
Sierra Nevada; Sandusky, Ohio (Douglass); Ogle Co., 111. 
(Bebb) ; Dixons, 111. (Vasey) ; Decorah, Iowa (Holway) ; 
Amherstburgh, Ontario (Macoun) ; Belleville, Ontario (Mrs. Roy); 
Santa Magdalena Mts., N. M. (G. R. Vasey) ; near Bozeman, 
Montana (Scribner). 

In the eastern United States, from southern New York to 
Maryland, this variety is apparently confined. to magnesian rocks. 
On Staten Island it is certainly restricted to the serpentine 
area ; with regard to the Pennsylvania localities, Mr. C. E. Smith 
writes : &quot; So far as I know or have ever heard, it is unknown in 
our district (Philadelphia), except in one spot about eleven miles 
west of the city, where the road to West Chester crosses the 
serpentine rocks, where it is plenty;&quot; and we have examined a 
specimen of Dr. Darlington&apos;s collecting, marked &quot; Serpentine 
hill, Westchester, Pa.,&quot; while in his &quot; Flora Cestrica,&quot; he remarks, 
&quot; Banks of serpentine rock, frequent ;&quot; as to the Delaware sta- 
tions, Mr. W. M. Canby says, &quot;I do not know of its growing 
elsewhere in this State, nor anywhere in this region (Newcastle 
Co.), except on the serpentine, where it is very plentiful,&quot; and 
Mr. A. Commons collected it &quot; on serpentine rock, Centre- 
ville, Del.&quot; It also appears to grow in other places on magnesian 
limestone, though we have not been able to verify this- to any 
extent ; specimens have been seen by us marked &quot; Banks of 
Susquehanna, Lancaster Co., Pa., T. C. Porter;&quot; and Professor 
Porter has sent us specimens from the vicinity of Easton, Penn., 
at both of which localities magnesian limestone occurs ; and the 
original of Dr. Torrey&apos;s C. oblongifolhun came from a region of 
magnesian limestone near Sandusky, Ohio. Further south and 
west than these points we have thus far been unable to follow 
this interesting association. 

In this connection we have thought it a matter of some inter- 
est to present the following analysis of the ash of this plant, from 
specimens collected on Todt Hill, Staten Island, kindly made 



49 

for us by Mr. Ernest J. Lederle, of the School of Mines : 

SiHca ( Si O2) - - - - - 39.85 

Alumina and Oxide of Iron (AI2 O3 and Fcg O3) 18.58 

Lime (Ca O) - - - - - - 9.35 

Magnesia (Mg O _ _ _ . _ 19.79 

From this it is seen that the magnesia constitutes about one- 
fifth of the entire ash of the plant, and is present in larger 
quantity than any other constituent except the silica. 

It should be remarked that the specimens seen from about 
Washington, D. C, and from Montgomery county, Md., are 
larger than those from the serpentine areas. The same may 
also be said of the specimens from Amherstburgh, Ontario, said 
by Mr. Macoun to grow in &quot;damp woods,&quot; and also of those 
from the West. In some respects these approach the forms 
referred by us to var. maximum. 

In Meehan&apos;s &quot; Native Flowers and Ferns of the United 
States,&quot; Vol. ii., plate 48, is an illustration of one of these large 
forms, made from a specimen collected in Bergen Park, Colo., at 
an altitude of 7,000 feet. If this drawing is correct, it very 
nearly represents our var. maximum, but we have not seen any 
specimens of this from the Rocky Mountain regions. 

Between Dr. Torrey&apos;s original description in the American 
Journal of Science and Arts, in 1822, and his later description in 
the Flora of the State of New York, published in 1843, there is 
the following discrepancy : In the former the leaves are described 
as acute, and the capsules as shorter than the calyx, while in the 
latter the leaves are described as mostly obtuse, and the capsules 
as about twice as long as the calyx. This is, perhaps, to be 
accounted for by the original imperfect material. The latter 
description agrees with the characters of our var. oblongifolium,. 

Var. VILLOSUM, n. var. Stem leaves lanceolate to ovate- 
lanceolate ; capsules 2 to 2\ times the length of the calyx ; the 
whole plant densely villous-pubescent. (Plate LXV., f 8.)

This variety is to be regarded as the extreme broad-leaved 
and hairy form of the species. Its range appears to be restricted 
to the serpentine barrens of Pennsylvania, where it apparently 
passes gradually into the var. oblongifoliiivi. 

Var. FuEGlANUM, Hook., f Low ; smooth ; leaves short, small, 
coriaceous and imbricated, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate in out- 
line ; pedicels solitary, or in few-flowered cymes ; capsules some- 
what exceeding the calyx. (Plate LXIV., f 3.)

This interesting form is identical with the var. Fiiegiamim, 
Hook, f, in Bot. U. S. Expl. Exp., i., 129 (our Plate LXIV.,

it. 

As analagous to this remarkable distribution we have that of 
Carex Magellanica, Lam., whose range in North America is 
from the arctic regions to northern Pennsylvania and Utah.

ca?i/is, \\e indicated two species, N. denndata and .A&quot;, foliosa. 
Bentham regarded the two species eis one, in which he was prob- 
ably right, the more so as Nuttall says they grow together and 
perliaps are not distinct; and to the combined species he gave the 
name of N. Nuttallii, ob\&apos;iousl&gt;- because neither of Nuttall&apos;s 
names was properl}- appHcable to the species as he regarded it. 
This mode of proceeding has not been rare in similar cases, and 
in the present instance seems to be quite justified, if not actually 
demanded, by the rule that false names are inadmissible. 

Note on Sarracenia variolaris.* 

Last March I had in my room, in Gainesville, Florida, a vase 
full of Sarracenia variolaris (Yellow pitcher plant), and my at- 
tention was attracted towards one blossom which failed to open 
all of its petals. Examining it, I found that two of these, opposite 
each other, clung by their tips to the center of the umbrella- 
shaped style and were fastened securely there. Using a little 
force, I tore the tips of the petals off&quot;, instead of pulling them 
assunder as I had expected to do. I then opened the style with 
a pin and found that the tips of the petals had penetrated the 
style and had reached nearly or quite to its base. 

After that I examined all the blossoms of 5. variolaris that 
I could gather, and noticed a considerable number of variations. 
I saw the first case repeated in one instance, but this time there 
was only one petal connected with the style. 

The normal number of sepals and petals is five with the 
margins entire. I found irregularities both in the number and in 
the shape of these. Often there were notches in the petals, and 
these were sometimes found in the sepals too. The division was 
even carried so far that occasionally six petals would be found. 
There were also irregular notches in the umbrella-shaped top of 
the style. In several cases the yellow^ petals were marked with 
delicate reddish lines at the base. Mary F. Peirce. 

/ *CoMMUNiCATED BY Dr. Gr.w.— Oil examination of the style in some of the 
specimens supplied by Miss Peirce. we find that it is more or less hollow, the tube 
widening at the orifice. Perhaps there is a viscid secretion, by which the tips of the 
petals were stuck fast. This should be looked to ne.xt spring, on the living plants. 
We cannot make out what is meant by the tips of the petals having &quot;penetrated the 
style.&quot; Asa Gray.

Plant Notes from Termiscouata County, Canada. 
\l\ J. I. North ROF. 

The parish of Notre Dame du Lac lies on ihe western shore 
of Lake Termiscouata, Termiscouata Co., Canada, about forty- 
eight miles from Riviere du Loup and thirty-one miles from 
Edmundston, N. B. 

The surrounding country is for the most part rolling hills 
covered with the usual second growth of spruce, fir, larch and 
birch. There are also groves of sugar maple and yellow birch, 
and on the lowland near the lake the balsam poplar, Populus 
balsamifera, grows luxuriantly. Populus tremuloides, Acer rii- 
briini, A. spicaticm, Prnmis Pennsylvanicuni and Rhus typhina are 
common trees of the region. 

The lake is about thirty miles long, and varies from three- 
quarters of a mile to two miles in width. The .shore is in most 
places of slate, forming rocky points running into the lake, some- 
times so abruptly as to make passing exceedingly difficult. \\\ 
the crevices of the slate grow Lobelia Kalmii, Campanula roUuid- 
ifolia and Parnassia Caroliniaua. Near the bank we find 
Potentilla fruticosa, Spircea salicifolia and Myrica gale. 

Farther up Alnus viridis, Coi^nus stolonifera and Viburnum 
Opulus form thickets guarded by the ever present Joe Pieweed, 
Eupatoritim purpureum. Here and there along the bank the 
berries of Pyrus sambucifolia add their bright color to the scene. 

Along the roadside, where not shaded by trees, Artemisia 
vulgaris grows in undisturbed luxuriance, in company with the 
wild raspberry, Rubus strigosus, and Sambucus racemosa. 

In the fields one misses the ubiquitous Chrysanthemum Leu- 
canthemum^ but its place is well filled by Anaphalis margaritacca 
and the Canada thistle. \\\ many places the banks of the road- 
side are covered with the bunch berr)^, Cornus Canadensis, which 
the French Canadians aptly called &quot; La rouge.&quot; Driving back 
from the lake, five or six ranges of hills are crossed in as man}&apos; 
miles. In the valleys are lakes bordered with cedar swamps of 
Thuja occidentalis. The lakes are shallow and have a muddy 
bottom. Cassandra calyculata, Kalmia angjistifolia, Ledum lati- 
folium, are common on the borders. 

The road from Notre Dame du Lac to Riviere du Loup runs 



231 

partly through scattered farms and partly through woodland. 
The land where cleared and neglected is covered with a dense 
growth of Ptci&apos;is aqnilina and Epilobium spicatiim. 

From Riviere du Loup I drove to Cacouna, a distance of four 
miles down the St. Lawrence. The beach at Cacouna is rocky in 
some places, and at others sandy. On the sand Cakile Ameri- 
cana, Lathy rus maritimus, Merteiisia mariiima and Arenaria 
peploides, were collected. On the rocky points Plantago niarittDia 
was found abundant. 

The plants of the following list were mostly collected during 
the month of August, at Notre Dame du Lac. A few are from 
Grand Falls, N. B., where a stay of a few days was made. 

Dr. N. L. Britton has kindly annotated the list, and many 
thanks are due him for his assistance and for suggestions in re- 
gard to nomenclature.

Sherardia arvensis. 

So much has been said of this plant in the BULLETIN, that I 
am moved to call attention to some facts in its life-history that 
merit attention. I suppose in the work of most botanists&apos; lives, 
there is a large amount of &quot; unfinished business,&quot; which we hope 
to take up and consider, but which, as years roll over us, we feel 
may never be reached. Long ago I had hoped to take up a fur- 
ther study of Sherardia. As the time may never come, I throw 
out what I have noted for others to build on if they feel so disposed. 

I have looked for dimorphism, common in allied genera, and 
at one time thought I had detected it. But the pistil grows af- 
ter the stamens have reached their final length. This explains 
why the pistil seems sometimes equal and sometimes longer than 
the stamens. 

The stamens have a curious fashion of recurving at the an- 
gles of the corolla-tubes the day after the anthers mature, but 
they assume an erect position the following day. 

The seeds are very small, but the cotyledons or seed-leaves 
are remarkably large. I have sometimes seen them half an inch 
in diameter. In poor soil they arc a quarter of an inch. The 
succeeding nodes have leaves four in a whorl, and these four arc 
also large, orbicular and alirupti}- pointed.

A LIST OF PLANTS COLLECTED BY MISS MAEY B. CROFT, 1884- 
^85, AT SAN DIEGO, TEXAS, NEAR THE HEADWATERS OF 
THE RIO DULCE, BY N. L. BrITTON AND H. H. RUSBY. 

The species here enumerated were collected by Miss Croft 
during the years 1884-1886 and sent to Dr. Rusby for deter-

examination until the present time. 

RANUNCULACE^. 

19. Anemone decapetala, L., var. heterophylla (Nutt.) 
{A. heterophylla, Nutt., mss.; Wood). We are unable to find 
any characters which would entitle this plant to specific rank. 
Indeed, our specimens show every gradation in leaf-form 
from the linear lobes of the typical A. decapetala to the 
nearly entire ones of the variety. A specimen collected by 
Merrill, in Robertson Co., Texas,&apos; has both forms on the same 
plant. As here recognized, the variety extends east into Ala- 
bama (Buckley) and occurs also in South America, Cuming&apos;s 
specimens from Valparaiso in Herb. Torrey consisting of both 
type and variety.

Aqiiilegia Canadensis, L., van FLAVIFLORA, n. var. {A. Jiavi- 
Jlora, Tenney, Amer. Nat., i., 389). On the isth of May, 1866, 
Prof. Sanborn Tenney, of Vassar College, found a yellow-flow- 
ered Columbine on the high ground west of the Hudson, and 
opposite the city of Poughkeepsie, which he described in the 
first volume of the American Naturalist as Aquilegia flaviflora. 
On May 17th of the succeeding year he collected the same vari- 
ety near the same place, and proposed to try to raise the plant 
from the seed. Of his farther observations I find no record. 

On May 24, 1885, during a Club Field Excursion at Sea- 
bright, Monmouth County, New Jersey, the plant was found in 
considerable abundance on the south bank of the Navesink 
River, along the top of a bluff some twenty feet above the water 
level. It grew there with the ordinary red-flowered, typical form, 
with which its showy flowers formed a marked and beautiful con- 
trast, both being remarkably luxuriant. Associated with them 
was Cerastiiim arvense, L., and near by grew Smilacina stellata, 
Desf , neither of which had been noted so far south along the 
coast. I removed a plant of the yellow Aquilegia to a garden 
where it has since bloomed every year, maintaining its character. 
I have not been able to detect any other differences between it 
and the type except that the whole plant is of a light yellowish 
green instead of the usual reddish purple hue of the young plants 
of the ordinary form. 

Cerastium Texanum, n. sp. Stem slender, 15-20 cm. high^ 
pilose, especially towards the base, branching dichotomously

above ; leaves two to four pairs on the lower part of the stem, 
spatulate with an acute apex, sparingly pilose on both surfaces, 
8-15 mm. long, 3-4 mm. wide; flowers few, small, terminating 
the branches; calyx lobes ovate, acute, 4-5 mm. long, nerved, 
minutely hairy; petals apparently linear, slightly longer; capsule 
about 7 mm. long, its ten teeth revolute ; seeds numerous, angu- 
lar, roughened with minute points. 

Habitat: &quot; Hills, Blanco, March, April,&quot; C. Wright, Mexican 
Boundary Survey Collections, No. 69. 

This very distinct species is represented in the Torrey Herba- 
rium by half a dozen fragments, and does not appear to have 
been distributed. It adds another member to the section Strepio- 
carpi, and seems nearest to C. pilosum. 

Astilbe decandra, D. Don, var. CRENATILOBA, n. var. Leaf- 
lets obtuse, crenate, mucronate, the upper one somewhat three- 
lobed ; follicles about 2 mm. long, ovate ; calyx lobes obtuse. 
Collected on the slope of Roan Mt, East Tennessee, along the 
trail from &quot; Cloudland &quot; to the Roan Mt. station of the E. T.&amp;W. N. C. R. R. 

The plant differs markedly from the typical Astilbe decandra 
in its shorter and stouter pods and blunt crenate leaves. It may 
be more than a mere variety, but I do not feel warranted in de- 
scribing it as a species. The fact of collection is noted in this 
Bulletin, Vol. xiii, p. 74. 

Juncus filipenduhis, Buckley, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 
1862, p. 8. {J. Buckleyi, Engelm., Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis, 
iii., p. 435 ; y. leptocaulis, Torr., apud Engelm., 1. c, p. 454.) 

Mr. Buckley&apos;s name has distinct priority over Dr. Engel- 
mann&apos;s and should be restored. The plant was collected in 1887 
by Mr. Nealley. 

Cyperus Martindalei, n. sp. Culms erect, very slender, 
smooth, 50 to 60 cm. high ; leaves very narrowly linear, nearly 
smooth with a prominent midrib, about half the length of the 
culm; involucre of about 3 leaves, 4 to 10 cm. long, the longest 
overtopping the inflorescence ; umbel of a sessile head of numer- 
ous spikes and i to 3 smaller heads on slender peduncles ; spikes 
linear, about seven-flowered ; scales ovate, obtusish, about nine- 
nerved ; achenium linear-oblong, triangular, about i mm. long,

acute. Bases of the culms hard and corm-like, as in C. strigosus, 
L, ; rootstocks very slender, with delicate scales. 

Florida, from the herbarium of Dr. Ferdinand Rugel, now 
incorporated with that of I. C. Martindale, an enthusiastic col- 
lector and patron of botany, for whom the species is named. 
Collected also by Chapman at Appalachicola, and marked in his 
herbarium at Columbia College, as C. ovularis, Torn, with which 
it has but little affinity. In habit it resembles C. filiculmis, Vahl. 

Cyperus ECHINATUS (Ell.) {Mariscus echinatus, Ell., Sk., 
i, 75, 182 1 ; Cyperus Baldwinii, Torr., Ann. Lye, iii., 270, 1836.) 
This species, not hitherto reported from beyond the limits of the 
United States, though from its collection by the botanists of the 
Mexican Boundary Survey, and by Buckley in the Valley of the 
Rio Grande, we may suspect its occurrence in northern Mexico, 
comes now from Jamaica (J. Hart, No. 1034.) 

Var. MULTIFLORA (Chapm.), n. var. Spikelets ten to even 
twenty five-flowered, the latter elongated to 20-25 mm, (C 
Baldwinii, var. niultiflora, Chapm., in Torr. Herb.) 

Cyperus ferax, Richard. Not reported from Mexico nor 
Central America, in Hemsley&apos;s Botany of the Biologia Centrali- 
Americanae is 1980, 1979 Miiller from Orizava, 438 Bernouilli 
from Mazatenango, Guatemala, and also from Chihuahua (E. 
Wilkenson, in Herb., J. Donnell Smith.) 

Cyperus ochraceus, Vahl, is also omitted from the Botany of 
the Biologia. It appears to be quite widely distributed, how- 
ever, having been collected by Botteri, as already noted by me, 
and is represented in Miiller&apos;s collections from Orizava by Nos. 
198 1 and 1982, and was collected by Tiirckheim at Coban, 
Guatemala, in 1887, and distributed by Capt. J. Donnell Smith 
as No. 1262. 

Cyperus humilis, Kunth, var. ELATIOR, n. var. Culms 
erect, 12 to 15 cm. high; cauline leaves about equalling the 
culm; those of the involucre about 3, the longest 15 cm. in 
length. Otherwise nearly as in the type, which we have in C. 
Wright, Plantae Cubanae, No. 700. 

Collected by H. von Tiirckheim, on the river-bank, near 
Coban, Guatemala (Distr. J. Donnell Smith, No. 705). 

Websteria SUBMERSA (Sauvalle.) {Scirpus submersus. 



100 

Sauv., Flor. Cubana, p. 176 (1868); IV. limnophila, S. Hart 
Wright, Bull. Torr. Club, xiv, p. 135 (1887). 

When examining the specimens of this plant kindly sent me 
by Mr. Wright, in June, 1887, I was much occupied with other 
matters and failed to recognize them as the same as Charles 
Wright&apos;s No. 3775, which had already received a name as cited 
above. I do not question the validity of the genus established 
by him, but would suggest its nearer affinity to Heleocharis, as 
indicated by Sauvalle, than to Diilichium, as supposed by Mr. 
Wright. 

Heleocharis Engelmanni, Steud., Syn. 79. This species was 
described from specimens collected by Dr. Engelmann, at St. 
Louis, Mo., and labelled by him: &quot; £&quot;. obtusa, Schult? var. setis 
brevioribusy It has an elongated, sub-cylindrical, often acutish 
spike and bristles only about the length of the achenium, or even 
shorter. In looking over a quite extensive suite of specimens of 
Heleocharis ovata (Roth), R. Br. {H. obtusa, Schultes), I find 
considerable variation in the relative lengths of bristles and 
achenium, while many which would fall under H. ovata through 
this character have heads elongated. The specimens most nearly 
according with Steudel&apos;s description of H. Engelmanni are from 
St. Louis (Engelmann, Riehl), Oquawka, Illinois (Patterson), 
(the var. detonsa, Gray), Tinicum, Delaware Co., Penn. (Porter) 
and &quot;hills in Waltham, Mass.,&quot; (B. D. Greene) the last being the 
H. obtusa, var. (3, Torrey, Ann. Lye, iii., 303. The material at 
command indicates that Steudel&apos;s species is a variety of the wide- 
spread H. ovata, as remarked by Dr. Watson, in Bot. Cal., ii, p. 
222, but more material is needed to settle this beyond dispute. 
The Eleocharis diandra, C. Wright, in Bull. Torr. Club, x., p. 
10 1, seems clearly to belong here, and was so placed by Dr. 
Gray in Bot. Gaz., iii., p. 81, before Mr. Wright&apos;s description was 
published. 

DiCHROMENA CEPHALOTES (Walt.) {Scirpus cephalotes, 
Walt, Flor. Car., p. 71 (1788); D. leucocephala, Michx., Flor. 
Bor. Am., i, p. 37 (1803).) 

Dichromena pubera, Vahl. Specimens collected by Dr. Wat- 
son in Guatemala (No. 166 a) are markedly proliferous, after the 
manner of some other sedges, the peduncles rooting at their apices. 



101 

DiCHROMENA Watsoni, n. sp. Culm stout, sulcata, nearly 
smooth, 40 to 50 cm. high; leaves of the stem about 5, 15 to 20 
cm. long, 5 to 7 mm. wide at the base, tapering to an acute 
apex, about seven-nerved, the nerves impressed on the upper 
surface and prominent on the lower; leaves of the involucre about 
nine, resembling those of the stem; spikes about nine, acute, 12 to 
15 mm. long, sessile, forming a capitate cluster at the summit of 
the culm ; scales ovate-lanceolate, acute and mucronate with the 
excurrent tip of the mid-nerve; achenium obovate, much shorter 
than the scale, transversely rugose, tipped with a broad, depressed 
tubercle; style very slender, two-cleft. 

A remarkably large species, the cauline leaves arising from 
loose sheaths, and those of the involucre differing from other 
species of the genus in being green to their bases. 

Collected by Dr. Sereno Watson in Guatemala, February to 
April, 1885 (No. 153.) 

Dichromena nivea, Bceckl., under Rhynchospora nivea, Boeckl., 
Linnaea, xxxvii., p. 528 (1871.) {D. diphylla, Torr., Herb, and 
1. c. ; D. Reverchoni, S. Hart Wright, Bull. Torr. Club, ix., p. 
m (1882.) 

Although this plant was collected by Lindheimer in Texas, 
as long ago as 1847, ^ri&lt;^ known to Dr. Torrey about that time, 
I cannot find any publication of his name until Bceckeler&apos;s paper 
above cited. It does not appear in the published lists of Lind- 
heimer&apos;s collections. Boeckler, referring it to the genus Rhyn- 
chospora, gave it another name, citing Torrey&apos;s as a synonym. 
It appears to me that this is ample publication and that the later 
name of Mr. Wright cannot stand. As regards the names of 
Boeckeler and Torrey, both are cited as manuscript synonyms by 
the former, with D. nivea one line before D. diphylla — a nice 
point in nomenclature but sufficient for priority. The species is 
represented by Lindheimer&apos;s No. 718, Berlandier&apos;s 2089, Rever- 
chon&apos;s 1233, and by a .specimen collected by Wright, all from 
Texas. Also from Arkansas (Beyrich, Leavenworth.) 

PSILOCARYA NITENS (Vahl.) {Scirpus nitens, Vahl, Enum. 
PL, ii., 272 (1806); P. rhynchosporoides. Torn, Ann. Lye. N. Y., 
iii., p. 361 (1836); Rhynchospora nitens, Gray.) 

The relationship of this species to the P. scirpoides, Torn, 



102 

cannot yet be regarded as established. True P. nitens has a 
transversely rugose achenium and a short tubercle ; true P. scir- 
potdes a smooth or but slightly rugose achenium and a long 
tubercle. A specimen in- Herb. Torrey, collected by Leaven- 
worth in East Florida and written up by Dr. Torrey as P. inter- 
media, has a strongly rugose achenium and a tubercle intermedi- 
ate in length, indicating that they may all be but forms of one 
species, to which Vahl&apos;s specific name must be applied. P. Tex- 
ensis, Torr.&amp;Hook , seems not much more distinct than the 
others. The fourth member of the genus {P. corymbiformis 
(Wright), Benth.&amp;Hook., Gen. PL, iii., 1048; Scirpus corymbi- 
formis, Wright, in Sauvalle Flor. Cubana, 176), has much more 
claim to specific rank. 

Fimbristylis capillaris (L.), Gray, must include a large num- 
ber of forms differing slightly in the amount of bearding at the 
mouths of the sheaths, the acute or obtuse apices of the scales 
and the size, markings and color of the nut. Besides the synon- 
omy cited in Hemsley&apos;s Biologia, we must add Isolepis ciliati- 
folia, Torr., which appears hardly separable even as a variety, 
while the following may perhaps stand as varieties or marked 
forms : 

Var. PILOSA, n. van Culms densely pilose throughout; 
scales dark brown, acute. (Guatemala, Santa Rosa, Tiirckheim, 
1887, No. 1283; Orizava, Miiller, 1853, No. 1966.) 

Var. COARCTATA (Ell.) {Isolepis coarctata, Torr.) Umbels 
contracted ; spikes linear-oblong. 

Fimbristylis Vahlii, Link., Hort. Berol., i, 287, is the older 
name for F. congesta, Torn, Ann. Lye, iii., p. 345, as noted by 
Bceckeler, Linnaea, xxxvii., p. 9. 

Fimbristylis monostachya (Vahl), Hassk., PI. Jav. Ran, p. 61 
(1848), is the name for Abilgaardia monostachya, Vahl, following 
Bentham and Hooker in reducing the genus to Fimbristylis. 

Fimbristylis schoenoides^ Vahl., has been collected by A. H. 
Curtiss, in Walton Co., Florida, as I have recently been informed 
by Dr. Watson. I do not find any record of its occurrence 
otherwise nearer than southern Asia, but there is a marked 
tropical distribution of Cyperaceae of which this is perhaps only 
another example.

Soirpus Pringlei, Britton. I Soirpus heterocarpns, Watson. 



103 

SciRPUS Pringlei, n. sp. Annual, caespitose, i to 2 inches 
high. Leaves capillary, all radical, about equalling the culm ; 
spikes terminal and also radical, the latter surrounded and much 
overtopped by the leaves ; terminal spikes oval, many-flowered, 
the lowest bract resembling the leaves, and an inch or so in 
length, the next 3-6 mm., the others lanceolate, very acute, 
about 2 mm. long, midribs slightly darker than the margins, 
every bract fertile ; achenia sharply trigonal, broadly obovoid, 
the angles slightly ridged, the summit truncate, style three-cleft, 
its base persistent, stamens two. Basal spikes fewer flowered, 
otherwise nearly as the upper ones. Whole plant yellowish 
green. 

Chihuahua, near Guerrero, C. G. Pringle, 1887, Nos. 1400 
and 1399, the latter specimens without terminal spikes. 

An interesting little species related to 5. heterocarpus, S. 
Wats., which was also collected by Mr. Pringle at the same 
place (No. 1398), and in aspect resembling Fimbristylis apus 
(Gray), Wats. 5. heterocarpus, is, however, coarser, its terminal 
spikes longer and narrower and dark brown ; the achenia of its 
basal spikes twice as large as those of the upper. The two spe- 
cies form a marked group of the genus. .S&quot;. heterocarpus is also 
now to be admitted into the United States lists, having been col- 
lected by Mr. Pringle, Aug. 29, 1884, on sandy plains south of 
Tucson, Arizona, near the Mexican boundary. Its range is also 
to be extended to the Bolivian Andes, Mandon&apos;s No. 1410 being 
referable to the species, differing only in the slightly coarser sur- 
face markings of the achenium.

Scirptis ntucronatus, L. This old world species was collected 
over twenty years ago in Delaware County, Penn., by Mr. C. E. 
Smith and Dr. Geo. Smith, and appears to have since lain un- 
noticed in our herbaria, which is to a certain degree my own 



104 

fault, for there is a specimen in the Torrey Herbarium dating back 
to 1864. Mr. Smith has sent me the following note on the 
locality : &quot; It is in a small patch of Sphagnum in a field, 300 feet 
above tide-water.&quot; Mr. Martindale has it from the ballast 
grounds at Camden, but there seems no doubt that the Delaware 
County plant is a native. It is not quite as stout as the plants 
from Asia and Mauritius, but agrees very well with French speci- 
mens in Herb. Torrey. 

Scirpus stenopJiy litis, Ell. {Isolepis stenophylla, Torr.), appears 
to be a true Scirpus, and is nearly related to S. barbatus, Rottb., 
to which it has been referred by Boeckeler, Linnaea, xxxvi., p. 
792, as var. Americanus. It seems to me specifically distinct, 
but if reducible to a variety of Rottboll&apos;s species, a result by no 
means impossible when more material is obtained, it must bear 
Elliott&apos;s name. 

Hemicarpha micrantha (Vahl.) {Scirpus micranthus,

In taking up the name I am guided by Boeckeler in Linnaea, 
xxxvii., p. 572, who states that he saw a specimen named by 
Lamarck in Willdenow&apos;s Herbarium. 

SCLERIA GRAMINIFOLIA, n. sp. Culms 35 to 40 cm. high, 
slender, erect, triangular in section; leaves 3 or 4, 12-15 cm. 
long, all cauline, narrowly linear, attenuate to an acute apex, the 
upper reaching to the inflorescence but not overtopping it ; pani- 
cle terminal, loose and quite simple, 4 to 5 cm. long, subtended 
by a linear bract, 2 to 6 cm. long ; heads androgynous, sessile, 
or on peduncles i to 2 cm. long, of from 2 to 5 flowers, the fer- 
tile and sterile about equal in number. Achenium globular, 2 
mm. in diameter, obtuse, minute apiculate, roughened, with 
short projecting processes, supported on a triangular perigynium, 
whose angles are prolonged upwards as ridges nearly to the apex 
of the achenium. Rootstocks fibrous. 

Collected by C. G. Pringle in wet places, pine barrens, base of 
the Sierra Madre, Chihuahua, Sept. 28, 1887 (No. 1401.)

(Reprinted from Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, July, ISSS.) 

An Enumeration of the Plants Collected by Dr. H. H. Rushy in South 

America. 1885-1886.-I. 

GENERAL FEATURES OF THE REGION TRAVERSED. 

The collections recorded in this series of papers were made 
during a two years journey along the Pacific coast and across the 
continent of South America, the special object being the investi- 
gation of Medical Botany. 

The route of travel covered regions the most diverse as re- 
gards all the conditions of plant life. North of Guayaquil the 
coast is verdant, the luxuriant tropical vegetation reaching the 
very water&apos;s edge. But a short distance south of that city be- 
gins an entirely different region. The eastern cordillera of the 
Andes divides South America into two portions, having almost 
nothing in common. While only a few miles in width, this cor- 
dillera marks differences in soil, climate, and general appearance, 
as great as any to be observed upon the globe. 

Upon the Pacific side there is a very general dearth of mois- 
ture, rain being in many places almost unknown, while upon the 
eastern slope rain is so constant that months may pass when the 
sun is seen for scarcely an entire hour, and the humidity is so great 
that clouds of rising vapor sometimes obscure the view of even 
the nearest objects. The laden clouds that sweep in from the 
tropical Atlantic lose little of their moisture in crossing the Ama- 
zonian basin ; any loss is but temporary, the equilibrium being at 
once restored by the soaking up of a fresh supply from the enor- 
mous water surface that the region presents. But immediately 
on reaching the mountains, great volumes of water are precipi- 
tated. The lightened clouds endeavor to escape upward, reach 
the colder strata, and suffer fresh precipitations. This process is 
continued over a belt of two hundred and fifty miles of steadily 
increasing elevation, until the winds which cross the cordillera 



(2) 1T8 

carry only the merest traces of moisture. Throughout most of 
this heavily watered region, the vegetation is of the densest char- 
acter. Allowing for the breaks caused by the streams, it might 
be said that an arboreal animal, ascending a tree upon the An- 
dean foothills, could pass to the Atlantic without once descending 
to the ground. 

The species and genera of this eastern Andean region have 
in general a very wide range. With the latitude, varies the alti- 
tude at which they grow. As w&apos;e pass to the cooler southern 
region, a species or its representative creeps down upon the 
mountain sides. Thus, the Desfontainea spinosa, Remy., which 
I collected abundantly in northern Bolivia, gradually descends, 
until in the neighborhood of the cape, Lieutenant Safford finds 
it near the sea level, constituting a characteristic feature of the 
landscape. Sometimes also, a species has its limits as to altitude 
very narrowly and sharply defined, but will be represented at 
successively lower elevations by other species exceedingly closely 
related. Of this, the Cinchonas furnish us a striking example. 
Each altitude has its own species — if species they can be called — 
and they usually overlap to but a trifling extent. I have (in 
two cases) looked along a mountain side where miles of Cinchona 
Calisaya had been planted, and seen the upward limit defined to 
within fifty feet by a line of dead or dying trees. 

In general, we are disappointed by the scarcity of fiowers as 
compared with the abundance of plants. To this rule, trees and 
many herbs are exceptions. But in the case of shrubs and vines, 
of which latter there is everywhere a multitude, it is strikingly 
true. It is probably to be accounted for by the steepness of the 
land and a climate highly favorable for the reestablishment of de- 
tached fragments, torn away and carried to a new position. Un- 
able to obtain the light and air necessary for a high floral de- 
velopment, they have learned to depend upon a less complicated 
method. 

Turning to the western side, we find, as stated, a region in 
which almost every condition is reversed. With more or less 
scanty rains, strictly limited to a few months or even weeks, we 
get a treeless and almost shrubless region, with a temperature 
subject to very sudden and great variations. The amount of 



1T9 (3) 

moisture increases with the altitude. Upon our school-maps 
great deserts are located on the table lands of this region. The 
real deserts, however, are not there, but along the coast. Upon 
the highlands there is sufificient moisture to redeem the country 
from barrenness, and it is a fairly good stock country. As upon 
the eastern side, so upon the western, the highland vegetation 
creeps down the mountains as we go southward, until at Val- 
paraiso it reaches the ocean. North of Valparaiso there is thus 
left a true desert along the coast, which widens as we go north- 
ward, until at the boundary of Chili and Peru, we find miles of 
pure, absolutely barren sand. To the patient and industrious 
botanist this coast desert will furnish a far more interesting field 
than the luxuriant regions to the eastward. There is no regular 
water supply, the showers being infrequent and spasmodic, with 
years sometimes elapsing between them. But when they do oc- 
cur in sufficient quantity we find a rich and beautiful flora, 
springing up, maturing and perishing in an incredibly short 
period of time. What special provisions are required, and what 
lessons in physiology are to be learned, while watching the pro- 
cesses of birth and extinction which are here going on ! Long 
after the flora of the Amazonian basin shall have been satisfac- 
torily classified, this desert region will be contributing its annual 
quota of undescribed species. 

With this very meagre general outline before us, we shall 
notice briefly the special localities where the collections were 
made. 

A part of a day each were spent at Guayaquil, Zorritos, 
Payta and Coquimbo, and two or three days at Lima, but only 
fragments were collected. Zorritos stands at the northern ex- 
tremity of the desert, and is watered with moderate frequency. 
The Prosopis, Cereus, Amarantaceae and Chenopodiaceae, re- 
minded me strongly of the gravelly hills of the Mohave desert. 
Payta is one of the dryest spots in the world, and Coquimbo is 
but little better. Lima, like Tacna, stands near the foot of the 
mountain. At the latter place a week was spent in the early 
part of February. No rain had occurred, and the fifty species 
collected were all from irrigated grounds. Tacna has one small 
stream, conducted through the town by a paved channel, and it 



(4) 180 

does duty in great part as a sewer, besides furnishing the only 
water supply. From Tacna, the route lay seven days by mule, 
to La Paz. At nine thousand feet, 17° south latitude,* the veg- 
etation is sufficient to afford pasturage for the llama. At twelve 
thousand feet we are upon the table-land, which is, in part at 
least, volcanic, and at first thickly covered Avith loose rounded 
stones. Farther on it becomes sandy and rocky by turns. We 
cross many superimposed small ranges, and skirt the bases of 
much greater ones. The landscape is much like that of our own 
south-western plateau, except that there is less grass. What fre- 
quently appears like a grassy plain, proves to be covered with 
plants like dwarf Hypochceris or Perezia, only an inch or two in 
height, and presenting a green cushion of needles in the form of 
spines terminating the erect linear leaves. Numerous species 
oi Adesmia, rarely rising above a foot from the ground, and often 
very closely prostrate, cover much of the country. 

Near the eastern verge of this table-land, in a basin two 
thousand feet deep, with nearly vertical walls of clay or gravel, 
is situated La Paz, at an elevation of about eleven thousand feet. 
Here I spent some two weeks during the months of February, 
March and April, collecting one hundred and fifty or more species. 
This was during the latter half of the rainy season, when the 
wails of the basin, and the gravelly and rocky hills along the La 
Paz River to the south, were richly clothed with plants in flower. 
The remainder of the time during this period was passed across 
the range in Yungas. Returning early in April to the coast, I 
proceeded to Valparaiso, where three months were spent. Here 
the season is earlier, and winter was just setting in when I arrived. 
A winter there is about the same as in northern Florida, the 
orange surviving, but not thriving. Some twenty-five or thirty 
stray specimens were found in flower before I returned to La 
Paz. It being then early in June, I found a dry and wintry 
season prevailing, with a most dreary prospect for a collector. 
For a longtime business detained me in the city, save for a few 
short excursions across the mountains, and one long sta}- in the 
province of Yungas, made, unfortunately, at an unfavorable season 
for collecting. Just as the rains were beginning the next Janu- 

&quot;Distances, latitudes and altitudes are given approximately.

ary, I was obliged to leave La Paz on my journey to the Atlan- 
tic. Thus, out of almost a year spent in this interesting region, 
fortune had favored me with only about two weeks favorable col- 
lecting. But extensive collections had been made meantime 
upon the eastern slope at Unduavi and Yungas. Unduavi is one 
of several little hamlets upon a mountain stream in the first valley 
to the eastward of La Paz. But I have characterized by this 
name the entire collecting station constituted by this valley and 
its enclosing mountains. At 1 2,000 feet begins the semi-alpine 
flora generally associated with Aspiditim aculeatum and the 
smaller species of Acrostichum. At 10,000 feet the shining, 
coriaceous leaves of the tropics begin to be seen, and at 8,000 
feet the vegetation is truly tropical, including bamboos, fuchsias 
and begonias. The whole surface is characteristically rocky, the 
soil being very scanty indeed, but rich. At Unduavi, between 
8,000 and 10,000 feet, I collected 150 species in flower in Octo- 
ber, in three days. 

Crossing the northern wall of this valley, we find upon the 
summit, at about 11,000 or i2,OQO feet, a cold, boggy and cloudy 
region, where sphagnums and long drooping lichens abound. 
Upon the other side we are in Yungas, referring not to the polit- 
ical boundary, but to my collecting station of that name. De- 
scending to 7,000 feet, we enter the great Andean forests which be- 
come heavier and heavier, though scarcely denser, as we descend. 
The trunks and greater branches are scarcely to be seen for the 
epiphytes upon them, chief of which are orchids, bromeliads, 
ferns, mosses and aroids. At 5,500 feet we strike the coca and 
cinchona belt, and at 4,000 feet we find the heat becoming op- 
pressive and the air sultry. From 3,500 to 5,500 feet is prob- 
ably the region of greatest rain-fall. The Yungas collections 
were chiefly made at elevations of 3,000, 4,000 and 6,000 feet. 

Leaving La Paz on the loth of January, 1886, we were at 
once overtaken by the unprecedented rains of that season. At 
Sorata, on the base of Mount Iliampu, we were detained by 
floods from the latter part of January till about the first of March. 
But little could be dried, and that little with the greatest diffi- 
culty, many of the collections being repeated once and some of 
them twice. In transit to the coast moreover, the continuous 



(6) 



182 



rains succeeded in penetrating some of the bales. A fine and 
little known alpine flora exists on Mt. Iliampu. The altitude 
and conditions of this locality are a parallel of those of Unduavi. 
One day&apos;s journey to the northward we reach Ingenio del Oro, a 
gold washing establishment. This locality is also very similar to 
Unduavi, but has the richest flora (March) of any locality that I 
have ever visited. It is above timber line. Three days of mis- 
erable exposure were passed here, and all our collections spoiled. 
Two days more brought us to Mapiri, a section almost precisely 
like Yungas, where, at 2,500 to 5,000 feet, I remained during 
March and April, improving the fairly good weather in making 
enormous collections, which arrived home, after great vicissitudes, 
in very fair condition. Mapiri is the great centre of Cincliona 
culture in South America, and large collections of these plants 
were made, among them being many new hybrids. The run of 
eighty-four miles to Guanai, 2,000 feet elevation, was made on 
rafts by the force of the current in a little less than eight hours. 
Arriving at Guanai three weeks earlier, we should have encoun- 
tered one of the most interesting floras in South America. How- 
ever, as we lost nearly everything collected at this place, it mat- 
tered but little. The forests at that point consist almost wholly 
of Mimosece, in prodigious variety. These had all gone to fruit 
and made rather ill looking specimens. At this point the succu- 
lent plants, such as Begonia, Oxalis and Bromeliaceas began to 
appear much less prominent. I had early abandoned the collec- 
tion of such plants, foreseeing that they would crowd out all other 
work, owing to the unlimited time necessary to dry them. 

Upon new and larger rafts we floated in eight days to Reyes, 
the mountains becoming smaller, and the banks lower and lower 
as we proceeded, until, just at the port of Reyes we cut through 
the outermost range of the Andean foothills. Here, at an alti- 
tude of 1,500 feet, the forests are broken by patches of pampa, 
which are projected into them from the South, and the varying 
conditions of lake and river, forest, plain and bog, produce a flora 
of surpassing interest. Nearly two months were passed in Reyes, 
and although sickness materially interfered, a handsome repre- 
sentation of between 400 and 500 species was secured. The 
whole of this collection, with the most of what we liad brought 



183 (7) 

from Guanai, 9,000 specimens in all, was found one morning 
sunken with our boat under fifteen feet of water. From this 
point on down the Beni, the country rapidly assumes the char- 
acter of the Brazilian forest, with a dense tangle in the sombre 
shade below and a wealth of floral life high above upon the tree 
tops. The month of July was passed in journeying down this 
river and making occasional short stops to collect. At the junc- 
tion of this river with the Madre de Dios, the centre of the rub- 
ber production of that district, two months were spent, and the 
finest part of my collection was prepared. Just below this junc- 
tion begins the series of falls produced by the river&apos;s cutting its 
way through a series of low hills. During the two months that 
were required to make the tedious transit of these falls, I had 
ample time to complete my collection with a handsome addition. 
Many of the Andean species with which we had already become 
familiar, here re-appeared. 

The entire collection includes somewhere about three thous- 
and numbers, of which an average of ten specimes were collected.

An Enumeration of the Plants Collected by H. H. Rusby, in 

Bolivia, 1885-1886.-II. 

By Elizabeth G. Britton. 
MUSCI. 

There has been a long delay in publishing this portion of the 
enumeration of Dr. Rusby&apos;s collection, because at the time that 
the first comparisons were made at Kew in the summer of 1888, 
I felt that further study, and, in many cases, better material would 
be necessary in order to accurately determine many of the species. 
Furthermore, all of Mandon&apos;s specimens, which were collected in 
the same localities which Dr. Rusby visited, such as La Paz and 
Sorata, were still lying in Schimper&apos;s herbarium undescribed and 
bearing only manuscript names. 

In all instances when Dr. Rusby&apos;s specimens agreed with 
Mandon&apos;s the latter have been cited by number and locality, but 
as we did not possess at that time a set of Mandon&apos;s mosses, and 
my time at Kew was limited, it was impossible for me to write de- 
scriptions of all of the new species preserved in Schimper&apos;s her- 
barium collected by him. Hoping, however, that some one better 
fitted to do this than myself would have the opportunity of study- 
ing these Bolivian mosses, and also in recognition of the special 
privileges accorded to me at Kew while studying there, the first 
and most complete set of Dr. Rusby&apos;s duplicates was deposited 
there. The second set was sent, after having been carefully 
studied and named as far as possible by one unacquainted with 



(10) 472 

Tropical American genera, to Dr. Carl MLiller, at Halle. He 
treated them in the same way that Schimper did Mandon&apos;s, giving 
most of them manuscript names, making few or no critical com- 
parisons, and furnishing no descriptions. As far as we know, 
they are still lying in his herbarium unpublished.* 

When we went to Europe, in 1891, I again took with me all 
the doubtful species and those supposed to be new, for the sake of 
making further comparisons at Kew with Schimper&apos;s specimens. 
In several cases, as shown in the text, I found that Dr. Mliller was 
mistaken, and that my original determinations were correct; in 
several others I found manuscript names of Schimper&apos;s given to 
Mandon&apos;s specimens which had priority over those of MuUer&apos;s 
given to Dr. Rusby&apos;s specimens. In several other cases the types 
were not at Kew, and the specimens had to be referred to William 
Mitten and Emile Bescherelle for further study. We visited Mr. 
Mitten and I showed him and gave him several species, the 
types of which were in his herbarium. He very kindly made the 
comparisons for me, and in several cases shared his specimens 
with me. 

We also took a set of the duplicates for M. Bescherelle, and I 
spent a day with him at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris looking up 
some of Montagne&apos;s types. In a letter received from him at Kew 
he says : 

&quot;As for the mosses collected in Bolivia by Mandon, I think I 
remember that they were distributed by me in 1869, after the 
death of Mandon, which occurred on the 30th of December, 1866. 
Schimper named them, but did not describe or diagnose them. 
All of Mandon&apos;s mosses, Bolivian and Madeira, were sent to me 
by M. Cosson to be made up into sets, which were sold for the 
benefit of the widow. I kept one set and the residue, and pro- 
posed publishing at least the list of new species with the numbers 
and localities, in order to save Schimper&apos;s priority in the new dis- 
coveries. Unfortunately, other occupations have prevented my 
accomplishing this project. It will give me pleasure to share with 
3&apos;ou my duplicates.&quot; 

We have to thank M. Bescherelle for a very good set of Man- 
don&apos;s mosses and we were also fortunate enough to secure Dr. 
Spruce&apos;s own private set of his Musci Amazonici et Andini, so 

* Since this manuscript was sent to the printer we have learned that Dr. Miiller is 
proposing to publish a Brylogia Boliviana in the Nuovo Giornale Botanico Italiano. 



473 ( 11 ) 

that we are now better able to study and compare Dr. Rusby&apos;s 
specimens. 

In 1893 we received a much larger collection of mosses than 
Dr. Rusby&apos;s, made by Mr. Pierre Jay in northern Bolivia, also 
from the vicinity of La Paz and Sorata. I again wrote to M. Besch- 
erelle, offering to send him a complete set if he would name 
them. He replied that he was so occupied with his studies of the 
mosses of Japan that he found it impossible to undertake it and 
that it was a thankless task acting as secretary for some one else. 
I might, perhaps, have been strongly tempted to take the same 
stand had there not been twelve pages skipped in the reprints of 
Dr. Rusby&apos;s enumeration and held in reserve for this list of 
mosses. Just as we are going to press I have received a pos- 
tal card from M. Emile Levier, inquiring for the Bang collection 
of Bolivian mosses and telling me that Dr. Carl Muller is printing 
in Florence a Bryologia Boliviana. As my manuscript is completed 
and the priority of Schimper&apos;s names from Mandon&apos;s collections is 
maintained throughout, we think it best to publish our enumera- 
tion independently. 

This summer I have also commenced wrapping and sorting 
Mr. Jay&apos;s collections and have found several of Dr. Rusby&apos;s new 
species in fruit, which had previously only been collected sterile, 
so that the work promises to be of great interest, but will take a 
good deal of time to accomplish with the limited collection at my 
disposal and the pressure of other duties. However, it seems best 
to publish the list of Dr. Rusby&apos;s collection as it stands, first with 
such determinations and descriptions as I now know to be correct, 
and to modify and amend this list subsequently as I find time to 
study and compare the fine collections made by Mr. Jay. 

The sequence of genera followed is nearly that given by Mitten 
in his Musci Austro-Americani (Journ. Linn, Soc. 12: 12-25. 
1869). Thirty-nine genera and ninety-six species are enumerated 
in this collection of which forty-two are new or previously unde- 
scribed. Six mosses, as many hepatics, four lichens and a io^N 
algae and fungi were also collected in Bolivia by A. M. Bang and 
enumerated by Dr. Rusby (Mem. Torr. Bot. Club, 4: 273). 
These were named by Mr. Wright at Kew, but the Spliagmims have 
since been examined and corrected by Dr. Warnstorf from speci- 
mens preserved in the Boissier Herbarium at Geneva.

&quot;Affine L. luteo foliis tamen patulis baud appressis or minus 
longe cuspidatis differt.&quot; 

At Kew in Herb. Hooker there are four specimens of Jame- 
son&apos;s from the Andes of Quito, labelled DidyuiodoTi liiteum, evi- 
dently the types of Hook. Lond. Journ. 5 : 48. No. 174 is anno- 
tated by Wilson : &quot; var. foliis magis recurvis patenti-recurvo ser- 
rulato.&quot; A part of 143 has the leaves much recurved as in 193b, 
both of which are sterile. On the same sheet is a specimen of G. 
Mandon&apos;s Plantae Andium Boliviensium Exsicc, no 1616, from 
vicinius Sorata labelled Didymodon luteits Taylor, which quite 
agrees with Rusby&apos;s specimens in its bright yellow recurved 
leaves, longer pedicels two or three in the same perichetium, and 
capsules twice longer than Jameson&apos;s specimen&apos;s. 

Leptodontium gracile C. Miiller, n. sp. Mapiri, 5000 ft (311 Ov 

Unduavi, 8000 ft. (3109). 

Plants bright yellowish green, stems slender, leaves squarrose 
and curled when dry; cells densely papillose and obscure above, 
clearer and oblong below, margins entire and recurved to above 
the middle, sharply and doubly serrate above. Plants all sterile. 

Allied to Didymodon cinifoUus Hpe. by its papillose leaves but 
with the aspect of L. gracilescens Miill. &quot; Affine L. luteo foliis

Leptodontium grimmioides C. Miiller, n. sp. Sorata, 13000 ft. 

(3192). 

Plants dark and discolored below, tips of the branches bright 
yellowish green, stems 3-4 crn. long, leaves squarrose, spreading 
and curled when dry, remaining undulate when moist, margins 
entire and recurved below with a few protruding teeth above, vein 
generally excurrent into a cuspidate apex, cells clear but papillose 
at base, densely and finely papillose above. Plants sterile. 

Leptodontinni Mandoni Sc\\., fide C. Muller. Unduavi, lOOOO 
ft. (3110). (Sterile.) 



475 ( 13 ) 

There is no specimen in Schimper&apos;s Herbarium at Kew bear- 
ng this name, so no comparison was possible. These specimens 
of Dr. Rusby&apos;s have the leaves strongly costate to the apex, the 
costa is papillose on the back, the margins are entire below, 
serrate and recurved above, papillose and undulate, the upper cells 
are smaU and round, but not opaque, the basal cells longer and 
brown. 
Hoi.OMiTRiUM BoLiviANUM C. MiiUcr, n. sp. Near Yungas, 4000 

ft. (3190)- 

Plants in light yellowish tangled mats, mixed with hepatics; 
stems 3-4 cm. long, flexuous and matted, with light-colored 
tomentum ; leaves 3-5 mm. long, linear lanceolate, twisted and 
curled when dry, costate to apex, serrate and papillose above as 
well as undulate, entire with revolute margins below; cells round 
and small, lower ones hyaline. Plants sterile. 

This species was compared with H. flexiiosum Mitt, at Kew, 
but it differs from No. 21 Spruce from Andes Ouitenses in the 
leaves, nor does it agree with any other species from this region 
at Kew. It should be compared with H. longifoliwu Hpe. 

Dicranelia angiistifoliaWxXX. Near Yungas, 4000 ft. (31 12). 

DiCRANELLA NANOCARPA C. Muller, n. sp. Near Yungas, 4000 

ft. (3139 pp). 

Stems 3-5 mm. high, simple or branching, leaves erect or 
slightly secund when dry, uppermost often 2 mm. long, linear- 
subulate, margin entire, vein excurrent with a {q.\n indistinct teeth 
at apex ; perichetial leaves broader and clasping at base. Dioeci- 
ous. Pedicels 5-8 mm. long, twisted above, bright orange; cap- 
sule erect, ovoid, less than .5 mm. long, with a longer straight beak 
on the lid than the theca, which becomes broad and hemispherical 
when empty ; mouth with a dark border, peristome red, teeth fuga- 
cious ; cells of the walls oblong or hexagonal in regular rows. 

Only six plants found mixed with a specimen of Pliilonotis, No. 
3139; the alliance was not determined. 

DiCRANUM SPECTABILE Sch. mss. Unduavi, 12000 ft. (3113-) 

Plants stout and large, much discolored at base, glossy and 
yellow at the tips of the branches; stems 10-15 cm. long, decum- 
bent, branching by short innovations, tomentose in the axils of 
the leaves, often slender and interruptedly foliate ; leaves longest 
at the tips of the branches, often 15 mm. in length and i mm. 
broad at base, to a concave apex with involute margins, entire 
below, serrate, becoming spinose along the excurrent vein ; basal 



(14.) 476 

cells larger and brown, a few hyaline ones near the vein, others 
conspicuously porose, becoming long, spindle-shaped above and 
oblique along the margin. Monoecious antheridia in small buds 
on the tomentum in the axils of the leaves. Pedicels 15-20 mm. 
long, much twisted to the left ; capsule 3-4 mm. long, erect, smooth, 
ovoid, largest at base, abruptly contracted or with a short neck ; 
lid with a slender oblique beak 2 mm. long ; mouth small, teeth 
short, slender and bifid. 

Compared with and equal to Mandon Plantae Andium Bolivi- 
ensium, No. 1609. Hab. vicinius Sorata, also Songo, 1857. 

Nearest to D. spcciosiiin Hk.&amp;Wilson. Compared with No. 
325 of W. Jameson&apos;s PI. Aequatoriales from which it differs in 
its more slender habit, shorter leaves and pedicels half as long. 
Dr. C. Mijller, also recognized this as a new species. 

Dicrajiian species? Yungas, 6000 ft. (31 15). 

These specimens are sterile, and have baffled Dr. Miiller, and 
Mr. Mitten as well. They have been compared with all the speci- 
mens at Kew likely to be the same. Mr. Mitten sent me a por- 
tion of his specimen of Dicraniun Mittenii CM., but they do not 
agree. Dr. Miiller named them Cmnpylopus concolor Hook., but 
they were compared at Kew with specimens in Hooker&apos;s herba- 
rium collected by Lindig in Bogota, and they differ in being much 
stouter plants of a glossy yellow color, with longer and broader 
leaves, which are serrate o)ily at the apex and have a much broader 
blade. 

Pilopogon gracilis Hook. Near Yungas, 6000 ft. (3159 in part). 

Compared with Hooker&apos;s specimens at Kew collected by Wed- 
dell in the Province of Yungas, Bolivia, May, 1847, ^^&apos;i^h which 
they agree in every way. The leaves are hyaline at the basal an- 
gles and these cells extend up along the margins; the short trans- 
verse walls of the cells are thickened ; the vein is broad, the 
margins incurved, and there are a few teeth at the apex. The 
perichetial leaves end in a very long tip, often extending half the 
length of the pedicel. 

Dr. Miiller gave this a manuscript name under Catagonio. 

Campylopus trivialis C. M. n. sp. Mapiri, 2500 ft. (3196). 

Plants loosely matted, dirty green; stems flexuous, not rigid, 
3-5 cm. long, usually simple, occasionally with crowded branches 



477 (15) 

at the apex of the stems ; stem leaves short, 3-5 mm. long, 
slightly falcate at the tips of the branches, tubular with incurved, 
entire margms ; vein more than one-third of the width of the base 
of leaf excurrent with a few teeth at apex ; basal cells thin, hyaline 
to the vein, not colored. 

Plants sterile and much less rigid than is usual in this genus ; 
their alliance was not indicated nor determined. 

Cauipylopus sp. undetermined. Yungas, 6000 ft. (31 16). 

Plants fragmentary and broken. Stems 2-3 cm. high, prolifer- 
ous with fasciculate branches at apex, branches often 15 mm. long 
with the leaves crowded at the summit ; leaves curled and twisted 
when dry, 3-5 mm. long, blade narrow, forming a serrate border 
of one row of cells almost to the apex ; vein papillose on the back ; 
cells enlarged at base, brown at angles; leaves of the branches 
shorter, often entire, and radiculose at base, perichetial leaves very 
long pointed, costate, entire, or scarcely serrulate ; cells much en- 
larged at base, brown, upper oblong ; antheridia in heads matted 
with brown radicles; pedicels several in the same head, 8-10 mm. 
long, curved, becoming erect where dry; capsules 1.5 mm. long, 
ovoid, not ribbed when dry ; peristome red, lid not seen. 

These specimens are closely allied to C. annotiniis Mitt., and 
C. dracJiypJiylhis Mitt., and C. niulticapsularis Sch., from all of 
which they differ in the leaves and the smooth walls of the cap- 
sules when dry. 

Grimmia nano-globosa C. M. n. sp. Mapiri, 5000 ft. (3195). 

Plants pulvinate in gray cushions, stems 5-8 mm. high ; leaves 
crowded with a long, rough, white hair-point, blade carinate, cells 
small, almost quadrate, sinuous, basal ones elongated. Dioe- 
cious (?). Perichetial leaves with a long sheathing base, the white 
tip reaching the lid of the capsule. Pedicel erect, straight, 3-4 mm. 
long; calyptra lobate-mitrate, capsules 1-1.5 mm. long, lid with a 
straight beak, .5 mm. long; annulus narrow, of several single 
rows of cells falling in fragments with the lid; peristome red; 
teeth short, papillose; spores smooth, .ooB-.Oio mm. 

A smaller species than either G. ovata Web.&amp;M., or G. longi- 
rostris Hook. 

Compared at Kew with Matthews&apos; Peruvian specimens labelled 
G. ovata and illustrated by W. Wilson. The Bolivian specimens 
are smaller.

Grimmia (Racomitrum) DiMORPHUM C. MuUer, n. sp. Unduavi, 

loooo ft., Oct., 1885 (31 18). 

Plants in dark dirty mats, stems blackened beneath, decum- 
bent, giving off lower branches 3-4 cm. long, branchlets short, 
fasciculate ; leaves subsecund, incurved and twisted when dry, 
spreading when moist, carinate, plicate with one strongly involute 
margin, generally blunt apex, but occasionally with a white mu- 
cronate tip or the apical ones with white crisped tips, vein promi- 
nently keeled, ending below the blunt apex or continuous into the 
white prolongation ; cells all uniformly sinuous, elongated with 
faint transverse walls; perichetium short, 3 mm. long, broadly 
convolute, sheathing; bracts broad, apex acute, cells scarcely sin- 
uous. Pedicels short, less than i cm., long, arcuate, twisted ; 
capsule erect, or bent, 3 mm. long, smooth except just below 
the small dark bordered mouth ; lid i mm. long, conic beaked, 
teeth long, slender, papillose, yellow. 

Compared with A&apos;, crispipilum Taylor in Herb. Hooker, nos. 1 35, 
a, b ; Spruce Musci Am. et And. 

Leaves less cirrous pointed than 135 b; stems shorter than 
135; leaves exactly alike; capsules on shorter pedicels, less cylin- 
dric, shorter and broader, with a broader mouth. General aspect 
quite different. 

Leucobiywn loiigifolhun Hpe. Mapiri, 2500 ft. May, 1886

TORTULACEAE. 

The treatment of this group by Mitten in his &quot; Musci Austro- 
Americani &quot; is far from satisfactory. It has seemed best, however, 
to follow him in this as in the other families. Duplicates of these 
were not sent to Dr. C. MiJller, as they had not been carefully 
studied nor compared at that time. Later M. Bescherelle had d 
set of them, and made one or two comparisons for me with Mon- 
tagne&apos;s types at the Jardin des Plantes. It will require more study 
and comparison with a more modern treatment of the family, 
before the specimens listed can be thoroughly understood. 

Tortilla {Trichostojmun) contortifolium Mitt.? Unduavi, 8,ooo 
ft. October, 1885 (3126). 

There were no specimens of this species at Kew; hence these 
specimens were named only from the description on page 147 of 
Mitten&apos;s Musci Austro-Americani. They were shown to Mitten 
and sent to M. Bescherelle, but should be compared with Spruce, 
&quot; No. 213, Andes Quitenses, Chimborazo (loooo ped.)&quot;

rata, April, 1858, in Herb. Hooker. Near Yungas, 4000 ft., 

1885, in Herb. Rusby, no. 3128. 

Plants 2-3 cm. high, dark below, red-brown above ; stems 
simple or branching by subapical innovations 1-2 cm. high; 
leaves curled and twisted when dry, spreading when moist from 
an erect, glossy claspmg base, the lanceolate blade 2 mm. long, 
suddenly bent and contracted from the hyaline base, i mm. long, 
upper cells small, dense and with thickened irregular walls and 
small, blunt papillae, decurrent at the margins a short distance on 
each side of the clasping base, vein large, yellow, ending in the 
acute apex. Dioecious? Perichetial leaves smaller, with a longer, 
more sheathing base. Pedicels 5-15 mm. long, twisted in two 
directions ; capsules 2-3 mm. long, straight, cylindric, smaller at 
the mouth; lid with a long curved beak, annulus large, falling 
with the lid ; peristome fragile, pale, papillose, teeth long and 
slender, thickened and united at the basal joints, .not twisted. 

Closely related to T. decolorans Hpe., from which it differs in 

its larger size, longer, more spreading and clasping leaves and paler 

not twisted peristome.

Tortilla [Barbnla) campylocarpa Taylor. Unduavi, 8000 ft. 
October, 1885 (3127). 

Compared with Spruce Musci Am. et And. nos. 185 and 201, 
agrees with specimens at Kew and has been verified by Bescherelle. 
Also compared with T. rectifolia Taylor, nos. 193-196, Spruce, 
from which it differs in its larger size and longer, more acuminate 
leaves. 

Barbula austro-revoluta Besch. mss. Near La Paz, loooo ft. 
April, 1885 (3129). 

Plants in dense light yellowish-green or slightly glaucous, and 
dirty tufts; stems I-2 cm. high uith numerous, slender, subapical 
branches; leaves erect-spreading when moist, spirally twisted 
around the stem when dry, small, i mm. or less long, with strongly 
revolute margins and a broad, thick, yellow vein, ending in and 
forming the blunt apex; lower cells oblong, clear; upper smaller, 
denser and papillose; dioecious (?), perichetial leaves with a 
longer, more hyaline, clasping base. Pedicels light yellow, 5-7 
mm. long; capsule 2 mm.; lid conic-beaked,cells spirally formed ; 
peristome immature. 

Closely related to no. 1622 of Mandon&apos;s Bolivian Mosses, col- 
lected in April, 1856, near Sorata, and labelled B. glaiiccscois in 
Herb. Schimper, but differing in the shorter, more blunt leaves, 
the more revolute margins, and in the yellow pedicel. Bescherelle 
says of it, &quot;j5. revobita affinis sed foliis magis obtusa acuminatis 
glaucescentibus cucullatis ; pedicello flavo, peristomio longe 
distat.&quot; 

ToRTULA (5j/;///7(f///&lt;7) sp.? Near Yungas, 4000 ft., 1885 (3124). 

Unduavi, 8000 feet. October, 1885 (3125 and 3127 pp). 

Plants in dirty, yellowish-brown tuffs; stems 1-I.5 cm. high, 
branching ; much abraded and discolored below; leaves erect-ap- 
pressed when dry, tufted on the stems, upper, green with white 
hair-points, the vein papillose on back, and excurrent into a rough 
awn, apex rounded, margins involute ; upper cells densely papil- 
lose, lower, clear and hyaline. Dioecious? Seta 10-12 mm. long, 
red below, twisted ; capsule narrowly cylindric, i mm. long, 
straight or slightly arcuate when old, with a long-exserted colu- 
mella; mouth small, annulus narrow, falling in fragments when 
old ; peristome short or broken, twisted from a short basal mem- 
brane ; teeth pale, papillose. 

These plants were compared with several of Mandon&apos;s Plantae 
Andes Boliviensium, but their alliance was not determined by me 
while at Kew, nor by M. Bescherelle, to whom they were subse- 
quently submitted. 



481 (19) 

Tortilla [SyntricJiid) Andicola Mont. Unduavi, 8000 ft. Octo- 
ber, 1885 (3120). Sterile plants only collected. 

Large sterile specimens answering the description given in the 
Ann. Sci. Nat. (Series 2, 953) and compared at the Jardin des 
Plantes with the type collected by D&apos;Orbigny near La Paz, in the 
Bolivian Andes. 

Tortilla {SyntricJiid) acidcata Wils.? Mapiri, 5000 ft. April, 
1886 (3123); Sorata, lOOOO ft. 

Compared at Kew with Spruce, no. 144 and Jameson&apos;s speci- 
mens from Pichincha, both cited by Mitten under the description 
of this species. Ours agree with Jameson&apos;s better than Spruce&apos;s 
no. 144, and it would seem as if the two were distinct or the 
species very variable. Bescherelle also seems to think there is 
room for separation here, as he says : &quot; T. aciileata Wils. affinior 
sed primo viso differt. Foliis integerrimis, magis papillosis, duplo 
longioribus, pilo valde longiore diversa, ut videtur — forsan species 
nova? 

ToRTULA (Syntrichia) bipedicellata n. sp. Bescherelle, M. S. 

Mapiri, 5000 ft. May, 1886 (3123a). 

Plants in small yellowish-brown tufts; stems I-2 cm. high; 
leaves not crowded, curled and twisted when dry, 3-4 mm. long, 
without a hyaline point, the vein stout and brown, but ending in a 
short mucronate point at the apex of the leaves; margins plane 
or rarely slightly revolute below; upper cells densely papillose, 
lower large, clear and oblong. Dioecious perichetial leaves not 
differentiated. Pedicels mostly two together, .about i cm. long, 
straw-colored; capsules 3-5 mm. with a long beaked lid, straight 
or slightly curved ; mouth small, red ; peristome not developed. 

Closely related to T. glacialis Kze. Compared at Kew with 
WeddeH&apos;s no. 20, collected in Bolivia, province of Larecaja, June, 
1847, with which it agrees in the leaf characters but differs in hav- 
ing the pedicels more uniformly in pairs. There is a mixture 
also in this species at Kew, for the specimens collected by Lieb- 
mann on Mt. Orizaba and Poeppig in Chili are very different in 
aspect. Brescherelle says of them : &quot; Affinis T. glacialis Kze., 
foliis tamen duplo-longioribus, ad summum planis haud undu- 
latis ; capsula geminore, peristomio non afformato.&quot; 

Tortida fragilisll2iy\ov7 Sorata, lOOOO ft. (3121). 

Compared with specimens at Kew collected by Lindig, New 



(20) 482 

Granada, 2075 , and Jameson&apos;s, from the Andes of Quito, 1 847. Our 
plants are larger than Lindig&apos;s, the capsules longer and the pedicels 
single. The leaf is broadly undulate, ending in a short cusp, the 
marginal cells short, quadrate and papillose, the basal cells oblong 
and hyaline. The basal membrane of the peristome is very short, 
the teeth twisted once, white and granulose. Bescherelle says of 
this: &quot; Folia ad basin margine recurvis, cellulis inferioribus simili- 
bus differe mihi videtur. 7. fragilis (N. Grenada, Lindig, 2075) 
folia basi plana, ab cellulis marginales inferiore minores ut margi- 
nata habet : an Z! /hr^z/zj&apos; forma peculiaris?&quot; 

Tortilla PicJiincJiensis Taylor [Barbula affinis Hpe.). Ingenio 
del Oro, loooo ft. (3122). 

Compared at Kew with Spruce&apos;s nos. 185, 194,* 197, 200-202 
Andium Quitensium. Also verified by M. Bescherelle. 

OrtJiotnchuui pariatiim Mitt. Sorata, lOOOO ft., Feb., 1886

Compared with no. 130 Spruce, And. Quit., with which it 
agrees. 

Macromitrium Rusbyanum E. G. Britton, n. sp. Unduavi 12000 

ft. October, 1885 (3188). 

Plants large and showy in yellowish-brown tufts; stems 9-10 
cm. long, repeatedly branching ; leaves brown, broken and abraded 
on the lower parts of the stems, light yellow, longer and spirally 
twisted at the tips of the branches, 5-9 mm. long, lanceolate-lin- 
ear, from a broader yellow or brown base, margins finely serrate 
above, vein ending in the channelled apex; lower cells elongated, 
porose ; upper, shorter with thick protruding walls. Dioecious? 
Seta twisted or arcuate, 5 mm. long, stout ; capsule almost globose, 
2 mm. long, walls smooth and thick, brown and shining; lid conic- 
beaked ; peristome double, outer, a thick fleshy membrane^ inner, 
short, fragile, with bright yellow smooth teeth ; calyptra, not seen ; 
spores large, .0810-.0864 mm. 

This is one of the handsomest species collected by Dr. Rusby 

and was dedicated to him by Dr. Mliller, but referred to a new 

genus allied to Leptodoiitiinn ; but after careful comparison 

at Kew with specimens of Macroinitriuni tricliopJiyllinn Mitt., 

and M. scopariiini Mitt., I have concluded that its alliance is with 

these species. The absence of the calyptra is unfortunate, but in 

all other respects the likeness is very close, and the alliance is 

concurred in by William Mitten, to whom specimens were sent. 



483 ( 21 ) 

ScHLOTTHEiMiA RusBYANA C. Muller, n. sp. Near Yungas, 4600 

ft. 1883(3191). 

Plants densely matted together in dark red-brown cushions 
among the roots of orchids. Stems trailing, branches erect, about 
I cm. long ; leaves densely crowded at the apex of the branches, 
erect-appressed and plicate when drj^ 1-1.5 mm. long, oblong, 
obtuse, the vein ending in a short cuspidate apex; upper cells in 
regular transverse rows, the blade slightly undulate ; lower elon- 
gated with thickened papillose ends. Plants sterile ; alliance not 
determined. 

Zygodon recurvifoliids Sch. Sorata, Bolivia, 8000 ft. Feb., 
1886(3194.) 

Compared with type in Herb. Schimper at Kew, no. 1629, G. 
Mandon Plantae Andium Boliviensium Exsicc. from Vicinius Sor- 
ata; also compared with no. 1627 Z.ferrugineiis Sch., of the same 
Exsiccatae, Dr. MUUer having determined Dr. Rusby&apos;s specimen 
as the last named species. It is unmistakably the former having 
much larger leaves which quickly become recurved when moist- 
ened. The plants also are not at all rusty. M. Bescherelle has 
subsequently supplied me with duplicates of Mandon&apos;s nos. 1629 
and 2627 and I have recently been able to verify my previous de- 
termination. 

Entosthodon papillosum E. G. Britton, n. sp. Sorata loooo ft. 

Feb. 1886 (3131). 

Plants scattered on hard, bare patches of earth; plants includ- 
ing the sporophyte 5-8 mm. high ; leaves few, rosulate, long subu- 
late, acuminate, the vein excurrent into or ending below the long 
slender tip, margins entire; cells very lax. Dioecious. Seta 5-8 
mm. long, stout, densely papillose, erect or slightly arcuate when 
dry, sinuous when moist ; capsule globose-pyriform, about 2 mm. 
long, including the stomatose neck; lid flat; peristome none; 
calyptra not lobed at base. 

Allied to E. Lhidigii Hpe. according to the description and 
key given by Mitten (Musci, Austro-Americani, p. 243), but differ- 
ing in the densely papillose pedicel. This and the following 
species were found growing together in the same patches. 

Entostliodon Liiidigii Hpe.? (ex. descriptio.) Sorata lOOOO ft. 
Feb. 1886(3131). 

Compared with specimens of E. J\Iando?ii Sch. mss., no. 1645, 
Mandon, Bolivia, the leaves of which are less acuminate and 
have not a subulate tip ; in both, the leaves are not bordered and 



( 22 ) 484 

the mouth is small and surrounded by 3-4 rows of darker, denser 
cells/ In E. apictdatiis Sch., no. 1646 of Mandon, the lid of the 
capsule is beaked, not flattened as in our specimens, and the leaves 
are not subulate pointed. 

Funaria Jiygronietrica (L.) Sibth. Near Yungas, 4000 ft, 1885 
(3132a). 

Growing mixed with Brytim argenteiun var, lanatiim. 

Funaria calvescens Schwaegr. Near Yungas, 4000-6000 ft., 
1885 (3133a); Unduavi, 8000 ft., Oct., 1885 (3133b). 
Funaria incurvifolia C. Miiller, n. sp. Near La Paz, loooo ft., 

Oct., 1885 (3132). 

Plants 1-2 cm., pale straw-yellow; stems often several together, 
2-5 mm. high; leaves rosulate, 2-2.5 nim. long, incurved, carinate- 
cucullate; vein yellow, ending in the acuminate, incurved apex; 
margins with a narrow border of i row of elongated cells, entire 
or faintly subserrulate ; cells of the basal angles large, swollen. 
Dioecious; seta 5-10 mm. long, pale yellow and twisted; capsule 
small, 1.5-2 mm., oblique-pyriform ; annulus large, compound, 
falling with the blunt lid; teetlj with projecting cross-bars; inner 
peristome present, of short slender segments. 

Belonging to the section of F. hygrometiica with which it was 
compared ; differs in being smaller with incurved, more hyaline 
leaves, the cells with thinner walls. 

Both F. liygrovietncoidcs Sch. (Mandon, no. 1648) and F. 
Mandoni Sch. (Mandon, no. 1647) have shorter, blunt leaves, 
with cells more lax and thicker walled, and the vein ending 
below the apex with the marginal cells more swollen. 

Philonotis asperrima cm., n. sp. Sorata, loooo ft. (3140). 

Plants small; stems matted with brown tomentum, branches 
short, less than 5 mm. long, numerous ; leaves of two kinds, those 
of the main stems with a long subulate tip, a dark excurrent vein 
and serrate, revolute margins, with clear, rectangular cells ; branch 
leaves smaller, the upper part of the leaf very spinose, the vein 
ending in the shorter, acuminate apex, margins plane or slightly 
recurved, sharply serrate ; lower cells quadrate, smoother and 
clearer than in the upper ones. Dioecious. Perichetical leaves, 
broad, hyaline, and clasping at base, with a long subulate apex. 
Pedicels short, i cm. ; capsules globose, 1.5-2 mm., oblique, strongly 
ribbed ; lid mamillate, appressed ; peristome double, endostome 
shorter than the teeth, mouth bordered by 4-6 rows of darker 
denser cells. 

Growing mixed with Brywn argentemn var. lanatuni and a 



485 . (2 :; 

sterile species of Dicranwn in dense tufts, copiously fruiting. 
Compared with nos. ii, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 21 of the species 
Hsted by Mitten in his Musci Austro-Americani. Most closely 
related to P. gracilenta Hpe., but differing in its smaller size and 
shorter pedicel. 

Philonotis pagionifolia C. M., n. sp. Yungas, 4000-6000 ft. 

1885(3139)- 

Plants forming dense, matted tufts, with little fruit ; stems 
short, branches fasciculate, about 5 mm. long, slender and curved 
at apex; leaves erect-spreading or secund, narrowly lanceolate, 
acuminate from a clasping, slightly decurrent base ; margins 
thickened or revolute with several rows of teeth from base to 
apex; vein thick, excurrent into a toothed subulate apex; cells 
clear and square at base, all papillose on the upper surface. Dioe- 
cious ; perigonium broad and clear at base, long-cuspidate at 
apex ; perichetium concave, hyaline at base, ecostate, also with a 
long serrate tip ; both sets of bracts much longer than the stem 
leaves. Pedicels 20-25 mm. long, bright glossy, orange-colored; 
capsule 3 mm. long, oblique, strongly ribbed when dry ; lid mam- 
illate ; peristome double. 

Resembling P. gracilenta Hpe. (Lindig, New Granada) but the 

leaves are more blunt. Compared with Mandon&apos;s no. 1676 from 

Sorata, Bolivia, named by Schimper Philonotis Boliviana, it differs 

in its slender and delicate branches, which are less fasciculate. 

Specimens at Kew are much confused in this troublesome group 

of species, but ours do not seem to agree with any of theirs. The 

nearest are those collected by Matthews at Casapi, Peru, in Herb. 

Hooker, named by Wilson and labelled &quot;No. 2313, Bartramia un- 

cinata&quot; {B. scabrida Schwaegr. Supp.//. 57), but they differ in the 

leaves being non-cuspidate and in the large ecostate perichetium. 

Bartramia (plicatella) scorpioides C. Miiller. n. sp. Near 

Yungas, 4000 ft., 1885 (3138). 

Plants large, 5-6 cm. high, decumbent and matted with brown 
tomentumatbase, yellowish-green, glossy; stems arcuate, branching 
by innovations 1-2 cm. long, or fasciculate; leaves secund, uncin- 
ate, acuminate, plicate; vein narrow, ending in the carinate serru- 
late apex, forming a sharp point; cells all papillose, the end walls 
thickened; dioecious; the antheridia surrounded by broad orange- 
colored bracts, with serrate papillose tips ; perichetial leaves broad, 
clasping and hyaline, smooth and entire, vein narrow, excurrent 
into a slender point ; pedicels 10-15 mm. long, red, curved at tip; 
capsules all eaten off or decayed. 



( 24 ) 486 

Resembling B. andina Mitt, in its secund leaves, but when 
compared with Spruce no. 429 from Pichincha they are quite dis- 
tinct, our species belonging to the section with B. araiaia and B. 
scopa) ia ,h\.\\. agreeing with neither. The absence of fruit prevents 
the determination of its closest alliance. 

Bartrainia toiiicntosa (Sw.) Mitt. Near Yungas, 4000 ft., 
1885 (3136b.) Unduavi, loooo ft. Oct. 1885 (3136a). Sorata

31:161. 1892. Sorata 1 3000 ft. February, 1886 (3137). 

Large plants of a glossy golden green color ; stems 6-7 cm. 
high densely matted with brown tomentum below ; capsules few 
and immature. 

Mixed with and resembling B. tomciitosa, but differing in its 
squarrose, not secund leaves, which are longer and more sharply 
acuminate, and serrate. 

Bartrauiia [Cryptopodiuni) Jamesoni Tayl. Near Yungas, 4000 ft.

Boliv., no. 1673. Vicinius Sorata, 3200-4000 m. Mapiri, 

5000 ft. May, 1886 (3135) H. H. R. 

Plants decumbent and matted together with brown tomentum 
at base; stems 3-4 cm. high ; leaves very brittle, with a conspicu- 
ous, white, clasping imbricate base, those of the young branches 
with a slender twisted apex 3-5 mm. long ; older ones all broken 
off, the white base smooth, the upper part opaque and papillose 
on the short walls of the cells ; margins bordered by i row of 
long yellow cells with small appressed teeth ; vein narrow, toothed 
on back. Dioecious. Perichetial leaves with a short base and 
long serrate awn. Pedicel curved, 5 mm. long, red; capsule 
curved, 2 mm. long, with a small orange-colored lid ; mouth 
small ; walls ribbed ; peristome short, double. 

Allied to B. potosica Mont., but differing in the longer, less 
crowded, more spreading leaves with a more conspicuous white 
clasping base. Named by Dr. Miiller for Dr. Rusby but Schim- 
per&apos;s name has priority. 
Bartramia (Vaginella) auricola C. M. n. sp. Ingenio del Oro, 

lOOOO ft., February, 1886 (3135b). Sorata, lOOOO ft., Feb- 
ruary, 1886 (3135a). 

Plants light green or brown when old, with numerous, erect, 



487 ( 25 ) 

simple stems, 1-2 cm. long, matted together with brown tomen- 
tum at base ; leaves 2-6 mm. long, crowded, their white bases im- 
bricated, the green upper part of the blade spreading, much 
broken, except on the youngest branches; margins finely and 
sharply serrate, bordered by one or two rows of smooth, elon- 
gated, clear cells, those of the blade densely papillose and opaque, 
vein narrow, keeled and spinose on back. Dioecious, perichetial 
leaf with a short basal blade only covering the foot and a long 
rough awn; pedicels short, 3-5 mm. long, pseudo-lateral, straight 
or curved ; capsules large, 3 mm., erect or oblique, strongly ribbed 
when dry and brown ; lid mamillate, appressed ; peristome double, 
teeth, orange-red, trabeculate on the inner face; spores large, .027- 
.032 mm., rough, brown. 

Differing from B. thrausta in its smaller size, more strict, erect 

habit, stouter more rigid leaves. Agrees with Lechler&apos;s no. 2680, 

from Chili, labelled B. potosica at Kew, but differs from the type of 

that species at Paris in the much more conspicuous white base of 

the leaves. 

Bryum Rusbyanum C. MUUer. n. sp. Yungas. 6000 ft. 1885 

(3148a). 

Plants slender, stems erect with short, strict branches, bearing 
small, erect, lanceolate, serrate leaves, vein disappearing below the 
apex; stem leaves larger, acuminate with a prominent red vein, 
also disappearing below the apex. Dioecious ; pedicel, 3 cm. 
long, tawny, capsule pendent, 3-4 mm. long, with a neck half its 
length ; lid mamillate; annulus double, inflated, dehiscent in frag- 
ments; mouth with an orange-colored border ; cell-walls of exothe- 
cium much thickened, peristome double, teeth white, granulose, 
erose and irregular, endostome also granular with a basal mem- 
brane, segments hardly distinguishable from the teeth, neither 
carinate nor parted, basal rudiments of cilia two ; spores large, 
yellow. 

Seemingly a Dicranolnyum most nearly allied to D.fiisifetinn, 
Mitt, with the type of which it was compared at South Kensing- 
ton. Nat. Hist, Museum. 

Bryum ( Weberd) albicans (VVahlb). Near Valparaiso, Chili, 
June, 1885 (3145). Antheridial plants only. Sorata, Bolivia, 
1 0000 ft. February, 1896 (3193). Sterile. 

Compared with Austin&apos;s, No. 189, Musci Appalachian!, these 
specimens agree perfectly in all the leaf characters, but are a little 
taller, 3-4 cm. in height.

Bryum humillimum CM., n. sp. Ingenio del Oro, loooo ft. 

March, 1886 (3147). 

Plants small, bright glossy, yellowish-green; with julaceous 
branches less than i cm. high ; stems red ; leaves small, i mm. 
or less, imbricate, concave, those of the young branches obtuse 
and closely imbricated, the vein dividing and ending below the 
apex ; lower cells lax and enlarged, upper rhomboidal spindle- 
shaped, forming small inconspicuous teeth. Dioecious. Pedicels 
short, 5-7 mm. long, darker below ; capsules 2 mm. long, pen- 
dant ; neck nearly half the length, contracted below the spore- 
sac; lid mamillate, orange-colored, rim red; annulus large, falling 
with the lid ; peristome double, outer of light yellow teeht, papil- 
lose outside, trabeculate inside ; endostome a shorter membrane 
with carinate segments, open along the keel, with rudiments of 
two cilia between. 

Closely allied to Bryimi jiilacejnn Sm.,but differing from Euro- 
pean specimens at Kew in the shorter more rigid branches, with 
more closely imbricated leaves and shorter pedicels. Specimens 
collected by Mandon near Guyaboya, 28th May, 1866, named 
B.julaceiuiiy at Kew, differ in much longer, more slender branches 
and pedicels 10-12 mm. long. 

Bryum sobolifemvi Taylor. Sorata, lOOOO ft. February, 1886. 
Ingenio del Oro, lOOOO ft. (3148). 

Compared at Kew with specimens collected by Jameson from

and with this name, and he replied &quot; forsan species nova.&quot; 

Bryum coloratum, C. Mijller, n. sp. Near La Paz. October, 

1885 (3141). 

Plants cespitose, in loose light-green cushions ; stems with 
several 4-5 short fasciculate innovations about i cm. high ; leaves

lanceolate carinate, serrate above the middle, margins bordered by 
2-3 rows of elongated cells ; vein round, ending in a short mu- 
cronate apex ; cells all regularly rhomboidal. Dioecious. Peri- 
chetial shorter with a longer mucronate tip. Pedicels straight or 
bent, about 2 cm. high, glossy yellow; capsules nodding, 4-5 mm. 
long, bright yellowish-brown ; neck short, plicate ; lid conic-

late cilia; spores brown .013-.016 mm. 

Resembling B. ccniiiiiui Hedvv. in the bright yellow color of its 
capsules, but a larger and coarser plant, seemingly one of the 
smaller Rhodohryums, with the leaves twisted when dry, allied to 
B. andicola. 

MielicJiliofcria campylocarpa H.&amp;T, Near Yungas, 4000 ft. 
1885(3150). 

Compared with no. 1694 of Mandon&apos;s Bolivian mosses, with 
which it agrees.

(3149)- 

MielicliJioferia n. sp. ? Ingenio del Oro, loooo ft. March, 
. 1886(3146). 

These specimens were compared at Kew with all the species 
described by Mitten (Jour. Linn. Soc. 12, 320) having leaves at 
all similar and found to be most nearly related to M. diplodontay 
but as the fruit is too immature to determine any peristome char- 
acters, it cannot be safely referred to any of them. A portion 
sent to C. Mijller was named by him MielicJilioferia modesta n. sp.

PoLYTRiCHADELPHUs GRGSSiDENS C. MiJller, n. sp. Yungas 4000- 

6000 ft. 1885 (3159). 

Plants dark red, glossy; stems erect, unbranched 5-6 cm. high, 
leaves erect, 5 mm. long, closely imbricate with a brown clasping 
base; margin coarsely serrate; vein pellucid, excurrent into a 
smooth blunt cusp ; perichaetium longer tipped, enclosing long dark 
protruding paraphyses ; Dioecious, the male plants proliferous at 
apex. Pedicels stout, erect, 2-3 cm. long, bright fulvous, capsules 
horizontal 4-5 mm. long; lid conic, beak hooked, 2 mm. long. 

Compared with P. nibiginosiis Mitt, no, 21 1, J. Weir, Andes

POLYTRICHADELPHUS INTEGRIFOLIUS CM., n. Sp. Unduavi, lOOOO 

ft. October, 1885 (3159a). 

Stems 5-8 cm. high, leafless below and tomentose, proliferous 
at apex; leaves erect, slightly spreading, vein broad, excurrent 
into a smooth, dark awn; margins entire, incurved; lamellae 
seven, rows of cells high, uppermost cells rounded in section. 
Dioecious. Perigonial bracts scarious, with short triangular 
points. 

Male plants only collected, and from the robust stems and 
broad, scarious, perigonial bracts it strongly resembles Polytri- 
chum. Compared with various species of PolytricliadclpJuis at 
Kew, none of which it resembles.

1886(3156). 

Polytnchuvi cnspidigennii Sch. Teste C. Miiller. Unduavi, 
18000 ft. October, 1885 (3156c). 

Plants 5-8 cm. high ; stems naked below, densely leafy above; 
leaves erect-appressed, almost imbricate when dry, 5 mm. long, 
margins serrate with a few large, coarse, teeth; lamellae filling 
almost all of the blade, margins only slightly incurved. Periche- 
tial leaves longer, erect, innermost with a scarious base and long, 
slender tips; pedicel 15-25 mm. long; capsules 3 mm. long with 
a small hypophysis; teeth lax, short, pale and regular. 

No specimens bearing this name can be found in Schimper&apos;s 
Herbarium at Kew. 
■ Polytriclnun aristifioriim Mitt. Unduavi, 8000 ft. October 

1885 (3155a). 

This species has also been collected at Yungas by Pearce 
There are a great many diverse localities cited for this species by 
Mitten, and there is as much diversity in the specimens at Kew. 
We referred all of Dr. Rusby&apos;s specimens from Yungas, nos. 3155b 
and c and no. 3155a from Sorata and 3155c from Mapiri to this 
species, but Dr. Miiller gave it a manuscript name, which is ante- 
dated by P. patnliim Harvey (Miill. Syn. Muse, i : 210) from Ne- 
paul. It seems probable that there is room for the separation of 
several species, but as ours agree with Jameson&apos;s from the Andes 



491 (28a) 

of Quito and Weddell&apos;s from Peru, we have thought it best to 
enumerate them under this species. 

PoLYTRiCHUM ANGUSTiCAULE CM., n. sp. Near Yungas, 4000 ft., 

1885(3155). 

Plants large, 8-10 cm. high; stems simple, 2-4 cm. high; leaves 
6-8 mm. long, the clasping base oblong, brown or slightly scari- 
ous on the margins, tapering into a slightly longer apex, with in- 
curved entire margins ; vein rough on back, with two or three 
rows of sharp teeth, excurrent into a smooth or only slightly rough- 
ened awn ; lamellae covering almost all of the blade, of 6-7 rows 
of cells, the last row elongated, conical and smooth. Dioecious ; 
male plants proliferous ; perichetial leaves with a long smooth 
point; seta 6-8 cm. long, stout, glossy, curved at apex ; capsules 
large, 5 mm. long, cubic, with a short wrinkled apophysis ; lid 
dark red, beak long; teeth white, 64. 

Closely allied to P. aristiflonim Mitt., and compared with speci- 
mens sent us by Wm. Mitten, collected in Venezuela by Funk and 
Schlim, no. 472. Differs in the longer, scarcely roughened awn of 
the leaves, which are more closely appressed when dry, and in the 
larger capsules. 

PLEUROCARPI. 

All the specimens of the pleurocarpous mosses as well as the 
acrocarpous ones were carefully studied and separated before du- 
plicates were sent to Dr. Miiller, yet in two cases in the genus 
Hookcria, there was evidently a mixture of species growing to- 
gether, which in one instance seems to have misled Dr. Miiller. 

HooKERiA Bakeri E. G. Britton, n. sp. Near Yungas, 4000 ft. 

1885 (3163). 

Plants yellowish-green, large and coarse; stems 2-3 cm. long; 
branches i cm., leaves curled and crisped when dry, more or less 
undulate with long subulate tips 2 mm. long, veins prominent 
when dry, ending just inside the margin, which is entire below, 
serrulate along the tapering apex and bordered by 3 rows of nar- 
row, elongated cells; those of the blade very large and clear, not 
papillose. Pedicel 20-25 trim, long, bright, glossy brown ; cap- 
sules ovoid, 2 mm., brown, walls thick ; lid conic-rostrate ; teeth 
long, slender, brown and incurved in pairs, and papillose ; endo- 
stome yellow, erect, carinate segments closed. 

Compared with H. inargmata to which it is related, but differs 

in the lighter green leaves, broader and less acuminate, the cells 

more lax and hyaline.

Dedicated to Mr. J. G. Baker, of the Ro}&apos;al Herbarium at Kevv, 
in grateful acknowledgement of the many kind favors received 
from him while at work, under his charge, on Dr. Rusby&apos;s Ferns 
and Mosses, and also as a small recognition of the task he accom- 
plished in mountmg and putting in order the Herbarium of W. P. 
Schimper, presented to Kew by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts. 

This species was first named H. castanea, from the description 
only, and when submitted to Dr. Miiller he discovered three new 
species in it; but as we can find but one specimen in our packet, 
and have no means of determining which of his names apply to 
our species, we have discarded all his manuscript names. 

HooKERiA PURPUREOPHYLLA CM., n. sp. Near Yungas, 6000 ft. 

1885 (3164). 

Plants small, light reddish brown, .7-1.5 cm. high; stems 
branched, distichous, or flattened ; leaves small, i mm. long, 
closely imbricate, appressed with flexuous, filiform spreading 
points; veins ending below the rounded part of apex, toothed at 
the back of the leaf above; margins serrate to below the middle, 
more coarsely so above ; cells papillose, upper wine-color, lower 
colorless and longer; pedicel purple, 15 mm. long, arched at 
apex; capsule 2 mm. long; neck tapering; lid conic-rostrate. 
Peristome not yet matured, torn off with lid. 

Compared with H. {Callicgstelld) mfcsccns Mitt. (Spruce, no. 
629) from which it differs in the longer acuminate leaves; they 
also are more slender and not so crisped as those of H. pui&apos;piirea 
and are too acute for H. incurva. Our plants are mixed with a 
small, golden yellow Hypmnn in fruit, and a brown Hepatic, but 
we cannot find the two species of Hookcria, indicated by Dr. Miiller 
in his letter by two other manuscript names.

sium, Exsicc, no. 1641. Vicinius Sorata, 1858, Mandon. 

Sorata, loooo ft., February, 1886, H. H. R. (no. 3153). 

Plants crowded in brown masses&apos;, stems copiously branching, 
less than 2 cm. high, discolored beneath, green at tips of branches; 
leaves closely imbricated, lower ones with short white tips, those 
at the ends of the branches frequently prolonged into flex- 



493 (28c) 

uous white hairs, ovate and quite concave in the middle with a 
plane border of small square cells in straight rows, and the mar- 
gins double or recurved, bluntly papillose, frequently brown 
in the upper half with elongated cells in the centre of the base, and 
others sinuous; apex serrulate or erose when long and hyaline; 
perichetium short, 3 mm., enclosing very long paraphyses, bracts 
strongly plicate, cells long and clear, apex not hyaline ; pedicels 
I cm. long, capsules about 3 mm. with small orange-colored 
mouth and apiculate lid. 

Mandon&apos;s specimens at Kew in Herb. Schimper are somewhat 
larger and lighter colored than Dr. Rusby&apos;s, but agree in all es- 
sential characters, especially no. 1641 of the Exsiccatae in Herb. 
Hooker. Sent to Dr. MuUer as H. cUrhifolia (Wils.) Mitt. (J. L. 
Soc. xii., 406, ex descriptio) and named by him Braunia argyrocarpa 
n, sp., also to Bescherelle, who says,&quot; ut videtur foliis tamen apice 
diaphanis quod nos indicat Mitten.&quot; 
Braunia subplicata E. G. Britton, n. sp. Ingenio del Oro, loooo 

ft, May, 1886 (3154); Mapiri, 5000 ft. (3154a). 

Plants dark brownish green, in large dense mats, stems de- 
cumbent, pinnately branched, often giving off radiculose stolons, 
branches erect, 4-5 cm. long ; leaves subsecund when moist, im- 
bricate and erect when dry, with three blunt ridges, not hyaline 
pointed, ovate-concave, over i mm. long, less than i mm. broad, 
with entire revolute margins and a conspicuously rolled border to 
the concave center, apex acute and concave, erose dentate, but not 
hyaline, conspicuously papillose at the tips of the branches, basal 
cells elongated brown, others regular and sinuous; perichetium 
narrowly lanceolate, erect, sulcate, 3 mm. long, with oblong yellow 
cells at base and middle and blunt erose tips ; pedicels i cm. long, 
erect or cernuous twisted, fulvous as well as the base of the cap- 
sule, which is 2 mm. long with a straight beak over i mm. long, 
mouth with a thick red rim, calyptra brown, 3 mm. long, tufted 
and ragged at base with a straight beak i mm. long. 

Differs from H. plicata Mitt. (Bridget, Bolivia in Herb. Hooker) 
in the dull brown color of the plants and in the leaves not being hy- 
aline tipped ; from H. secnnda (Hook. Musci Exot. t. 46, Humboldt&apos;s 
type in Herb. Hooker) in the larger, less secund leaves with more 
strongly revolute margins ; resembling only an unnamed scrap in 
Herb. Hooker, collected by Mathews in Peru at Casapi, and a 
part of Braunia siibsecunda Sch. M. S., no. 5, in Herb. Schimper 
without locality or name of collecter. (See Jaeger, p. 86) pencilled

Hedwigidmm inibcrbc Sm. Unduavi, looo ft. (3152) Sterile. 
Mapiri, 5000 ft. with 3154a fertile. 

Compared with G. Mandon Plantae Andeum Boliviensium 
Exsicc, no., 1638 vicinius Sorata, labelled Harrisonia rJiabdocarpa 
Hpe. with which it agrees. As also with Lindig&apos;s New Granada, 
no. 2000. Both of these are considered to be H. hnbcrbe Sm. 
(Mitt. J. L. Soc. 12: 405). The plants mixed with 3154a are 
coarser and brighter green, agreeing better with Spruce Musci 
Am. et. And., nos. 1293-1295, of H. vnberbe. There is consider- 
able variation in the size and color of this species, also in the de- 
gree of ramification of the stems and the appression of the leaves, 
but otherwise the leaves are indistinguishable when placed side by 
side under the same cover-glass under the microscope. Wed- 
dell&apos;s no. 9 Peru, are small, little over i cm. high and almost sim- 
ple like 3152 H. H. R., while Spruce no. 1295 and Rusby&apos;s 3154a 
are nearly 6 cm, high and quite pinnately branched.

1688), vicinius Sorata, 3200 metr., 1857. H. H. Rusby. 

Sorata, 1 0000 ft. 1886(3165). 

Plants large, slender; stems bipinnate, 10-15 cm. long, 
branches pendant, 5-6 cm. long, branchlets few and distant, 
I-I.5 cm. long; leaves spreading when dry, those of the 
branches 2 mm. long, those of the branchlets only about i 
mm. long, both lanceolate-acuminate, vein ending below the 
long subulate, serrate apex, margins entire below, slightly 
recurved in the middle; basal angles auricled, decurrent. Cap- 
sules two or three together at intervals along the branches, 
perichetial leaves with a broad, clasping base covering the capsule, 
vein scarcely extending below the long nearly smooth awn, 
exceeding the base in length. Capsules 2 mm. long ; peristome 
double, the outer of long, spreading, broad teeth, the inner of 
shorter, narrower segments, composed of a double row of papil- 
lose cells, attached to a basal membrane. 

Allied to C. pdifera Mitt., and possibly referable to that spe- 
cies, but recognized also by Miiller as a new species, Schimper&apos;s 
name having priority.

margins minutely serrate; cells all papillose. 

Plants sterile. Alliance not determined. 

Meteorium lonchotrichum C. M. n. sp. Near Yungas, 4000 ft. 
1885 (3172). 

Plants bright yellowish-green, glossy ; stems long, creeping ; 
branches irregularly pinnate, 2-3 cm. long; leaves 1-1.5 mm. 
long, undulate, crisped when dry, lanceolate-acuminate, serrate, 
vein ending below the apex, cells of the basal angles enlarged. 

Plants sterile. Allied to M. patnbnn Sw. 

Meteojvnn filifetiiin (CM.) Mitt. Near Yungas, 4000 ft. 1885. 
(3173). 

Plants dark green or black with lighter yellowish branches. 
Youngest shoots very slender, filform, and totally different in as- 
pect from the older stems ; stem leaves, entire, concave, the vein 
ending below the short recurved cuspidate point; basal angles con- 
spicuously inflated at the inner angle, with a small round group 
of yellow cells ; leaves of the young branchlets much smaller, 
distant, narrowly lanceolate-acuminate, vein ending below the long 
filiform point ; basal angles decurrent with the same conspicuous 
round auricle, at the inner point of insertion. 

Named from description, and compared with No. 131 col- 
lected by Weir, Andes Bogotensis from which it differs in aspect, 
and the presence of the long filiform branches described in the 
original. 

Meteorium (Pilotrichella) perinflata CM. n. sp. Near Yun- 
gas, 6000 ft. 1885 (3 171). 

Plants light yellowish-green, glossy; primary stems 10-15 cm. 
long, creeping; branches simple, 1-2 cm. long, or with a few short 
branchlets; leaves concave, the margins so completely incurved 
as to almost meet, quite entire; vein narrow, ending below the 
short, sharp-pointed apex ; cells of the outer basal angles square, 
enlarged, slightly auricled and decurrent. Fruiting branches 
5 mm. long, perichetial leaves far exceeding the capsules, imbri-

cate, each with a long, squarrose, acuminate apex, with a short 
vein or veinless. Capsule brown, thick-walled, ovoid, about 2 
mm. long, on a short seta ; peristome double, teeth long, slender, 
yellow, endostome as long, carinate segments rarely open along 
the keel; spores green, .021-.024 mm. 

Allied to M. crinituin Sull., but differing in the entire leaves 

and the long peristome, the inner not adhering to the outer 

Specimens not compared. 

Meteorium (Pilotrichella) reflecto-mucronata C. M. n. sp 

Sorata, loooo ft., February, 1886 (3170). 

Plants light green, glossy ; stems creeping and rooting ; branches 
about I cm.; leaves imbricate, concave, with reflexed points ; vein 
very short and indistinct; margins incurved, entire, forming a cu- 
cullate cuspidate apex ; cells of basal angles enlarged, but indistinct, 
slightly decumbent. 

Plants sterile. Alliance not determined.

PoROTRiCEiuM (Thamnium) Bolivianum C. M. n. sp. Near Yun- 
gas, 4000 ft., 1885 (3174)- 

Plants light yellowish-green, with a creeping rhizome ; stems 
4-5 cm. long, naked below, about 2 cm., bipinnate ; branches flat- 
tened, frond-like, red; leaves compressed, elliptical-oblong, unequal 
at base, about i mm. long ; vein dividing and disappearing below 
the broad sharply serrate apex ; margins entire below ; cells of the 
basal angles only slightly differentiated ; monoecious ; antheridial 
buds on different branches from the archegonia; perichetial leaves 
longer, outer squarrose, subulate, often veinless, inner erect-clasp- 
ing, with a narrow vein ; seta red, flexuous, 10-15 mm. long; cap- 
sule 2 mm., ovoid-cylindric, neck short; lid 2 mm. long, with a 
ong beak ; annulus large, simple ; peristome double, teeth long, 
slender, endostome of slender papillose carinate segments, open 
along the keel; cilia none. 

Allied to PorotricJuim longirostniin (Hook.) Mitt, and possibly 
referable to this variable species, according to Mitten. Compared 
at Kew with specimens collected by Spruce (And. Quit. nos. 
1361-1363) from which ours differ in being much coarser, with less 
slender, not flagellate branches and shorter stouter pedicels, 



497 (28g) 

agreeing better with Weddell&apos;s no. 53 from the Andes of Peru, but 
our plants are smaller with shorter leaves, turning yellower with 
age, and more coarsely and doubly serratd at the apex. 

Entodon Jamcsoui (Tayl.) Mitt. Unduavi, 8000 ft. October,

minute, ovate-acuminate with a long subulate point, margins 
spinose-dentate or rarely entire at the apex of the branches, vein 
ending above the middle ; basal cells square at the angles. Peri- 
chetial leaves broad and serrate at apex, with a suddenly subulate 
point; vein short. Pedicel erect, 5 mm. long ; capsule small, little 
over I mm. long, ovoid; neck distinct, tapering into the pedicel; 
lid conic-rostrate, small, yellow ; mouth small, bordered by 4-5 
rows of transversely elongated, darker, denser cells ; peristome 
short, teeth brown when old, pale when young, united in fours or 
divided when old, smooth, slender at apex. 

Closely related to F. polycavpa Hook, from which it dlflers in &apos; 
its abruptly subulate perichetial leaves and its ovate capsule.

bordered by the adherent segments of the inner peristome. 

Compared with Drepajiiuvi Jiainatiuii Mitt., no. 1046, Spruce 
Musci Am. et And.), specimens of which are preserved at Kew 
but are not listed by Mitten. Closely related to this species, but 
differs in its more clearly veined leaves and longer pedicels.

creeping, with short, irregular branches 5-8 mm. long; leaves im- 
bricate with spreading points, ovate-acuminate, less than i mm. 
long; margins entire; vein ending below the apex; cells rhom- 
boidal above, transversely elongated below, not papillose; monoe- 
cious ; perichetial leaves longer, erect, base long, clasping, vein 
ending below the acuminate apex; cells elongated ; pedicels red, 
10-15 mm. long; capsule cylindric, 2 mm.; lid conic; annulus 
falhng in fragments, narrow, single ; mouth bordered by darker, 
denser cells, walls thin ; peristome double, teeth long, slender, 
papillose at apex; endostome with a short. basal membrane and 
slender, carinate, papillose segments, thickened at the joints, or 
appendiculate ; cilia none. 

Allied to L. gracillinia Tayl., which has also been collected in 

Bolivia by Bridges, but differs in the vein ending below the apex 

and the leaves being quite smooth. Identical with no. 3185 cited 

above, which was also sent to Dr. MUller and named by him 

Psaidolcskea amblystegiella n. sp., but this name is too near P

Compared with Jameson&apos;s specimens from Pichincha and 
Pearce&apos;s from the Andes, duplicates of which have been sent to us 
from Kew. The specimens collected by Miguel Bang (No. 482) 
at Yungas, and listed by^r. Rusby (Mem. Torr. Club, 2 : No. 3, 
p. 274) as TInixidiuvi delicatuluni, were so named by Mr. C. H. 
Wright at Kew. Duplicates of all our specimens, including these, 
were submitted to Dr. George N. Best for critical comparison. 
He says : &quot; They apparently belong to one and the same species. 
The stem leaves differ from those of T. delicatnhmi in not being 
closely appressed when dry ; they are more concave, broader at 
base and more abruptly acuminate, somewhat undulate and ru- 
gose above, and the leaf-cells are more rectangular and less rhom- 
boidal. Notwithstanding these differences, which indicate a vari- 
ety rather than a distinct species, the general type remains well 
marked. I should refer your specimens to T.delicatuluin.&quot; But as 
these specimens are much larger and coarser than any of 7. deli- 
catulutn which we have ever seen, and they seem worthy of a 
distinctive name, we have maintained them as above listed.

Kew. To Professor Eaton and Mr. Baker, for their kindly assistance, I hereby 
tender my hearty thanks.

longe acuminatis, margine glabris, revolutis, subtusdensissime 
squamosis ; squamis ovatis-Ianceolatis, reticulatis, ciliatis ; 
stipes teretes, squamosi, prope basim articulati. 

Climbing on trees ; rhizome slender, less than i cm. 
in diameter, covered with dark-brown, glossy, stiff, lan- 
ceolate scales ; stipes clustered, terete, arising from lateral 
buds, 2 to 3 cm. long, and also covered with short, dark 
scales, when old of a bright reddish straw-color, showing 
a well marked joint less than i cm. from the rhizome ; fronds 
coriaceous, 30-40 cm. long, 2 to 5 mm. wide, broadest above 
the middle and tapering to each end, of a light green color 
when young, becoming tawny and mottled with black on the 
upper surface when old, densely covered beneath with ovate- 
lanceolate, ciliate and reticulate scales, naked above except 
along the midvein ; scales of the lower surface of the midvein 
mottled with black ; margins nearly naked and strongly 
revolute, even when boiled ; veins pinnate, about i mm. 
apart, sometimes bifurcate near the midvein. Yungas (342), 
sterile specimens only; collected also by R. Pearce, June, 
1865, at Ouichara, Herb. Kew, marked &quot;epiphytal ferns.&quot; 
Another specimen, collected by Pearce at the same time and 
place, has fronds nearly twice as long and broad, and the 
scales are round and more deeply laciniate — perhaps a different 
species. A remarkable species of the section Elaphoglossum 
not approaching any member of the group that we have seen; 
its nearest alliance is with A. lepidotiim, Willd., and probably 
with var. vittatuui, Sodiro, Recens. Crypt. Vase. Quitenses, 
p. 81. Named in honor of Professor Daniel Cady Eaton, of 
Yale University, who first declared it to be a new species.

This species, if correctly referred to the present genus, differs 
from all the others I have been able to examine in having 
the separate fruits connate to very near their beaks, forming 
a very dense head. 

It also diverges from most of the species, in being entirely 
destitute of lepidote trichomes. The leaves are about 8 inches 
long by 2 inches wide, and are markedly acuminate.

The Genus Hicoria of Rafinesque. 



BY N. L. BRITTON. 



(Reprinted from Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Vol. YV., No. 11.) 



The Genus Hicoria of Rafinesque, 

By N. L. Britton. 

&quot;Scoria {tome7itosa, mucronata, alba, pyrifonnis, globosa,&amp;€}) 
Jiiglans alba L., tormentosa, mucronata, Mich.,&amp;c. The hick- 
ory.&quot; 

This is what Mr. Rafinesque is made to say in the Medical 
Repository, 2d hexade, Vol. v., p. 352, in the year 1808, under 
the title &quot; Prospectus of two intended works on North American 
Botany.&quot; 

Those who do not regard priority of publication as the all- 
important item in biological nomenclature will doubtless consider 
the facts and conclusions here presented as entirely uncalled for, 
and will object to them on the ground of unnecessary introduc- 
tion of new binomials for very familiar plants. While regretting 
the fact that in proposing changes of this kind it is quite impos- 
sible to please everybody, I am also assured that a large number 
of botanists will cordially welcome any move to restore old 
names, inasmuch as this tends to bring nomenclature to a stable 
basis — a result worth much momentary inconvenience. I am 
thus encouraged in calling the attention of American botanists to 
Rafinesque&apos;s generic name for the hickories, and am persuaded to 
believe that the literary recognition thus awarded is only too 
long delayed. 

The hickories are among the most characteristic elements of 
the existing North American flora, and together form a genus as 
marked in structure as it is in geographical distribution, being 
entirely confined to East America, with two species occurring in 
Mexico. For some reason the older botanists failed to recognize 
their generic validity. They, without exception, grouped the 
hickories with the real walnuts, regarding and describing all as 



278 

species o{ Juglans. Rafinesque was the first to record an opinion 
that they form a distinct genus and the name he proposed this 
should bear must certainly stand. His opinion is now shared by all. 

I do not know which of the old masters was the first to refer 
to these trees. Loudon says that the Eastern Shag-bark was in- 
troduced in English gardens in 1629. Parkinson states on page 
1414 of his Theatrum Botanicum (1640), alluding to this tree as 
&quot; Nux jfiiglans alba Virginiensis, the White Walnut of Virginia. 
The tree hereof groweth more upright and spreadeth lesse (he is 
comparing it with the real walnuts), the leaves are alike and the 
nut smaller, much thicker and whiter in the outer, hard shell 
than any of the former sort, and the kernel within much lesse 
also, but white and as sweete.&quot; Plukenet&apos;s Almagestrum Botan- 
icum (1696) p. 264, indicates four kinds as known to him: 

(i). Nux Juglans Virginiana folius vulgaris siinilis, fructu 
subrotundo, cortice diiriore Icevi. The Hickory or White Virgin- 
ian Walnut. Haec est ilia nux quam nostrates vocant the Hick- 
ery, seu Pickhickery Nut; cujus nucleis lac confident, Indi quod 
vocant Hickery Milk. He refers to Parkinson&apos;s description above 
quoted. This description appears to have been applied to the 
Eastern Shag-bark. 

(2). Nux Juglans Virginiana alba ^ninor, fructo nucis inos- 
cJiatm siinili, cortice glabra, surnmo fastigio veluti in aculeum pro- 
ducto. He figures the nut on Plate 309, fig. 2, a and b, repre- 
senting that of the Small-fruited Hickory. 

(3). Nux Juglans Virgi7iiana alba, fructu parvo anguloso 
cortice Icevi. Represented on the same plate, fig. 2, c, being a 
small nut of the Eastern Shag-bark. 

(4). Nux Juglans angulosa major, A mericana, fructu longiore, 
cortice albo Icevi, sunimo vertice niucronata. He figures both the 
foliage and the nut of this species (figs. 2 and 2 d), guesses that 
it came from New England, and, although he says that the seed 
is very bitter, I can only associate it with the Balsam Hickory. 

Miller&apos;s Gardener&apos;s Dictionary (1731) rcognized, however, 
only two of those described by Plukenet, still under Nux Juglans, 
remarking that &quot;the Virginian sorts are preserved as rarities by 
such persons who are curious in collecting the several sorts of 
trees.&quot; 



279 

I shall now attempt to trace in outline the history of the in- 
troduction into botanical literature of the names which the species 
we are now able to differentiate must bear. In this I have freely 
availed myself of the cited synonymy of the genus, and especially 
of the exhaustive display of it given by Professor C. S. Sargent, 
in the Forestry Report of the Tenth Census, comparing the refer- 
ences I have had occasion to ufc, but without noticing a single 
discrepancy. 

Linnaeus carried Miller&apos;s process of eliminating Plukenet&apos;s 
species still farther, for he records but a single species, viz : J^ig- 
lans alba (Species Plantarum, Ed. I., p. 997. (i/SS)- While 
his description and synonyms indicated that he had several spe- 
cies confounded, his specimens are of the Woolly Hickory or 
Moker Nut, as is stated by all recent authorities, and which I 
can now confirm from a recent inspection of them ; they consist 
of leaves and staminate catkins. It is quite remarkable that he 
was unable to separate more species, when we recall the large 
number of oaks, maples, ashes and other North American forest 
trees that he described. On one of these old herbarium sheets I 
was much interested to note the following memorandum written 
in pencil: &quot; Hickery Nut, forte genus novum, capsula 4-valvis.&quot; 
J. E. S. I cannot find that Sir J. E. Smith ever published any- 
thing on the subject. This name was in common use for the 
Moker Nut up to the appearance of the last edition of Bigelow&apos;s 
Florula Bostoniensis (1840). 

The seventh edition of Miller&apos;s Gardener&apos;s Dictionary, pub- 
lished in 1759, brought in two additional species, Jtiglans gla- 
bra, the Pig Nut, and Jiiglans ovata, the Eastern Shagbark. 

Humphrey Marshall&apos;s &quot; Arbustum Americanum &quot; appeared 
in 1785. He applied trinomial appellations to most of the spe- 
cies, regarding all the true hickories as varieties oi Juglans alba ; 
indeed he defines no t}&apos;pe of it. His Juglans alba minima has 
been referred to the Bitternut Hickory, and no doubt correctly 
so, although he calls it the Pig Nut, a name even yet applied to 
it in certain parts of the country. He names also Juglans Pecan, 
the Pecan Nut; the other forms described by him had already 
received names. 

In 1796 the Western Shell-bark Hickory was described as 



280 

yiigla7is sulcata, by Wildenow, in his Berlinische Baumzucht, p. 
154, together with several of the other species previously known. 

In 1803, Michaux (Flor. Bor. Amer., ii., 192) divided Jug- 
lans into two sections, the one containing the real walnuts, the 
other the hickories, but he did not give them even sub-generic 
names, and described no species additional to those previously 
recorded. 

The younger Michaux&apos;s Histoire des Arbres Forestiers de 
I&apos;Amerique Septentrionale (18 10), brought in Juglam myristiccB&apos; 
fonnis, the Nutmeg Hickory, and Juglans aquatica, the Water 
Hickory. 

We have now reached the time of Rafinesque, and his state- 
ment, given at the head of this article, is the first separation of 
the Hickories from the Walnuts, under a distinct name. Unfor- 
tunately the proof of his paper in the Medical Repository was 
not well read, and Scoria was printed for Hicoria. There need 
be no doubt of what was intended. Rafinesque says in his Flo- 
rula Ludoviciana (181 7), p. 109, &quot; My name, Hicorius, long ago 
proposed, contains all the species of Juglans, which have trifid 
male flowers (instead of six-cleft), generally tetrandrous. and 
fruits with angular and quadrifid shells.&quot; He then characterizes 
two species, both of which were already known. 

The next important phase in the history of the genus was the 
introduction of the generic name Carya, by Thomas Nuttall, in 
his Genera of North American Plants, published in 181 8. Quite 
ignoring Rafinesque, he publishes the genus as containing species 
of Juglans of Linnaeus and Willdenow, gives a list of nine spe- 
cies without their equivalents and with descriptions of three only, 
yet, inasmuch as many of his specimens are preserved, he is gen- 
erally cited as author of the binomials. This injustice did not 
pass without a protest on the part of Rafinesque, for in the very 
next year he remarks as follows, in &quot; Journal de Physique,&quot;&amp;c., 
p. 260 (Vol. Ixxxix., 1819): &apos;&apos;Hicorius, Raf Obs. Fl. Ludov., 
1817, a ete change sans cause en Carya, N., nom posterieur radi- 
cal at tres-mauvais.&quot; It is remarkable that he does not here re- 
fer to his publication in the Medical Repository nine years be- 
fore. But the next statement that Rafinesque made, regarding 
the genus (Alsographia Americana, 1838, p. 65), makes evident 
what he had then intended. He says under the caption : 



281 

HicoRiA OR Hickory Trees. 

&quot; Hicoria, Raf., 1808. Carya, Nuttall, 1818,&amp;c. As early 
as 1804 I proposed to separate the Hickories from the Walnuts, 
to which Muhlenberg objected. I did so in 1808, in my re- 
marks on Michaux&apos;s Flora, and again in 1817, in my Florula 
Ludoviciana, giving the almost Grecian name of Hicoria ; yet 
Nuttall changed it in 1818 (without mentioning my labor) into 
Carya, which merely means nut, and is as bad a name as that of 
Nux, given by Adanson to Juglans * * * ; some botanists 
have, however, adopted this bad name, but it is hoped will have 
no objection to my previous modification of it when they may 
know of my previous claim.&quot; Then follows a division of the 
genus into four sub-genera, under which species are mentioned 
without descriptions or equivalents. He also proposes three new 
species, all of which were previously known. It will be noticed 
that Rafinesque here refers to his remarks in 1808, on Michaux&apos;s 
Flora ; these I have have hitherto been unable to find, unless he 
is alluding to the Medical Repository paper, which makes mention 
of Michaux&apos;s book, but his spelling of //zVc7r/« in 1838, and refer- 
ence to his former statements, leave no doubt of what he intended 
for the orthography of what the printer made Scoria. It is very 
strange that the misprint was never alluded to by the author. 

In 1853 Major John LeConte described what he considered a 
new species of Pecan Nut, in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia 
Academy, of that year, p. 402. He remarks: &quot;This species 
of Hickorea, which I found cultivated in Georgia, is a native of 
the State of Texas. * * * I have adopted Mr. Rafinesque&apos;s 
name Hickorea for the genus in preference to Mr. Nuttall&apos;s Carya 
on the ground of priority. Whatever may have been the errors 
or aberrations of Rafinesque, Nuttall was not justified in changing 
a name proposed by the former years before any publication of 
his own.&quot; He then describes Hickorea Texana, which Prof. Sar- 
srent has reduced to the com.mon Pecan. I have not seen it. 

In 1862, Casimir DeCandolle published a memoir on the Jug- 
landeae in Annales des Sciences Naturales, (IV.), xviii., 33, 
where he described Carya Texana as a new species based on a 
specimen collected by Charles Wright in Eastern Texas, but in 
his subsequent monograph of the order for the Prodromus (Vol. 



282 

xvi., 2nd part, p. 145) he regards it as a doubtful species. This 
I have not seen. 

The latest addition to the species is to be found in Hemsley&apos;s 
Botany of Central America, (Vol. iii., p. 162) published in 1883, 
where Carya Mexicana, Engelm., is described from Dr. Engel- 
mann&apos;s manuscript, based on Parry and Palmer, No. 8343^ from 
mountains near San Luis Potosi, at an altitude of 8,000 
feet. After a careful examination of the materials preserved in 
the Philadelphia, Washington, Easton and New York Herbaria, 
I have not been able to reduce any of the species found in recent 
writings. I would, however, arrange them a little differently 
than has hitherto been done in order to bring out more natural 
alliances. It is a very perplexing genus, and I am not sure that 
any arrangement would be wholly satisfactory. The salient 
characters of one species are liable to appear in others, sometimes 
Avith considerable prominence, rendering it troublesome to refer 
certain individuals even when they are well known. Single her- 
barium specimens are, naturally, even more perplexing. My 
present notion of them is as follows : 

(A.) Subgenus Pacania, Raf , Alsogr. Amer., p. 65. Nut 
cylindical or oval, smooth, two-celled ; staminate catkins in 
lateral, nearly sessile fascicles at the summit of shoots of the pre- 
ceding year.

have been entirely unable to distinguish characters which will 
always separate it from the next. Professor Sargent has united 
it with the Eastern Shagbark, referring to it in the Forestry Re- 
port of the loth Census, p. 133, as &quot;a form with small, thin 
shelled nuts.&quot; I am very confident that its alliance is not with 
H. ovata. The mistake may have arisen from the fact that in 
the Herbarium of the Philadelphia Academy, a label of Nuttall&apos;s 
has been misplaced and pasted alongside of a flowering twig of 
H. ovata. But his original description, his authentic fruiting 
specimens both at Philadelphia and Kew, and the figure of the

barks, but rather as I have placed it.

is a specimen collected by Mr. Curtiss at Lookout Mountain,

and belongs, I suspect, to the group with thin husks. The fruit 
is oblong, an inch in length and strongly four-winged by the pro- 
jecting edges of the involucre valves. The leaflets are uniformly 
seven, ovate-lanceolate, acuminate, and remarkably pale beneath, 
in which character it differs from all the species I know. There 
is a slight amount of pubescence on the rachis and midveins. 

In the mountains of Sussex County, New Jersey, there oc- 
curs a form of H. glabra, which has more or less pubescence on 
the lower surfaces of the leaves, and particularly on the rachis 
at the base of the leaflets.

A Recent Discovery of Hybrid Oaks on Staten Island. 
By Arthur Hollick. 

Plates LXXXIII-LXXXV. 

One day during the past summer Mr. Wm. T. Davis, of 
Tompkinsville, Staten Island, brougiit to me some leaves of an 
oak tree which he had found growing in the neighborhood of 
Tottenville, Staten Island, N. Y. To my surprise and delight I 
recognized them as belonging to Qiierciis heterophylla, Michx. — 
the celebrated &quot; Bartram Oak.&quot; On September 2d we visited 
the locality and found not only typical Q. heterophylla, but also 
a number of other pecuHar forms, evidently hybrids, and including 
Q. Rudkini, Britton. On September 2 2d the trees were again 
visited ; a careful study was made of them and their surroundings 
and a fine series of leaves and fruit collected. Probably no better 
opportunities for observation or finer specimens for study and 
comparison have ever been obtained, and the results have proved 
to be highly interesting. Two recognized species are added to the 
local flora of Staten Island and to the flora of New York State, and 
the northern range of Q. heterophylla is extended about thirty miles 
from its nearest previously-reported station. Considerable new 
Ught is also shed upon the question of the proper status of this 
latter form, in the botanical world, whether as a species, a variety 
or a hybrid, and, if the latter, what species are the probable parents. 

The hmits of this paper forbid an extensive review of the ht- 
erature concerning these two interesting oaks, but for the benefit 
of all who may wish to study the subject I would refer to the ac- 
count of Q. Rudkini, by Dr. N. L. Britton, in Vol. IX. No. 2, of 
the Bulletin, and for Q. heterophylla to Mr. I. C. Martindale&apos;s 
&quot; Notes on the Bartram Oak,&quot; read before the West New Jersey 
Surveyors&apos; Association, Jan. 6, 1880, and subsequently published 
in pamphlet form by the author. As, however, everyone may 



304 

not have access to these documents, I have thought that the fol- 
lowing brief account of this latter oak — its history and the con- 
troversy regarding it — might not be out of place : 

Some time during the early part of the last century a peculiar 
oak tree attracted the attention of botanists and others. It was a 
single individual, growing on the farm of Mr. John Bartram, on 
the banks of the Schuylkill, just above Philadelphia. From its 
location it received the name &quot; Bartram Oak.&quot; It was also called 
&quot; Burriers Oak,&quot; though why this latter name I have never been 
able to obtain the slightest clue. Just when the tree was first ob- 
served there does not appear to be any record, but it must have 
been prior to the year 1750, for on page 183 of Darlington&apos;s 
&quot; Memorials of Bartram and Marshall&quot; there is printed a copy of 
a letter which was written by Peter CoUinson to John Bartram, 
from which I extract as follows : 

Mch. 5th, 1750-1. 
My Good Friend John : 

Pray what is the reason I have no acorns from that particular species of oak 
that Dr. Mitchell found in thy meadow? And I observe, in thy specimens, two 
other narrow leaved oaks. As I have now ground enough I wish for a dozen 
good acorns of each. * * * * 

Thine. P. Collinson. 

This is, I believe, the earliest reference in literature to this 
oak. No scientific name was given to it nor was it even men- 
tioned in Humphrey Marshall&apos;s &quot; Arbustrum Americanum,&quot; pub- 
lished in 1785. Andreas Michaux&apos;s &quot;Flora Boreali-Americana,&quot; 
published in 1803 and reprinted in 1820, does not enumerate it 
among the oaks, although it is evident that he must have been 
aware of its existence, as his son, F. Andre Michaux, says in his 
&quot; Histoire des Arbres Forestiers de 1&apos; Amerique Septentrionale,&quot; 
published in French in 1810 and republished in English in 1819: 
(See Vol. I, p. 75,76; plate 18.) &quot;Bartram Oak. Quercus 
heteropJiylla. Every botanist who has visited different regions of 
the globe must have rem.arked certain species of vegetables which 
are so little multiplied that they seem likely at no distant period 
to disappear from the earth. To this class belongs the Bartram 
Oak. Several English and American naturalists, who, like my 
father and myself, have spent years in exploring the United States, 
and who have obligingly communicated to us the result of their 
observations, have, like us, found no traces of this species except 



305 

a single stock in a field belonging to Mr. Bartram on the banks 
of the Schuylkill, 4 miles from Philadelphia. This is a flourishing 
tree, 30 feet in height and 12 inches in diameter; and seems 
formed to attain a much greater development. * * * * i 
was at first disposed to consider this tree as a variety of the laurel 
oak, to which it bears the greatest affinity ; but the leaves of that 
species are never indented, and not a stock of it exists within a 
hundred miles of Philadelphia.&quot; 

This is no doubt the first published description and represen- 
tation of this oak, and the very appropriate specific name given 
to it at that time by Michaux has fortunately not been subjected 
to any change by later botanists, so that there is no tangled skein 
of synonomy to unravel, and the specific title, heterophylla, 
&quot;various leaved,&quot; will always serve it as its name, no matter 
whether it be classed as a variety, a species, or a hybrid. From 
the time of Michaux&apos;s description until about the year 1850 no 
other trees seem to have been found, and the only ones known 
were the original and a few seedhngs from it. In fact, when 
the original tree was cut down, about the year 1840, it was 
thought that the species, if such it was, was exterminated. So 
that for a period of a hundred years the only material for study was 
from a single tree and its immediate progeny. This, however, 
did not prevent the botanists of that time from recording opinions 
in regard to it. Michaux, as before stated, gave to it a specific 
rank. Pursh said : &quot;* * It is probably only a hybrid plant.&quot; 
* * Nuttall asked : &quot; May not this be an anomalous variety of 
coccinea?&quot; Torrey states unequivocally : &quot;A hybrid.&quot; Gray, in 
his Manual published in 1848, says: &quot;* * * doubtless a hybrid 
between Q. Phellos and Q. falcata, or some other species of that 
section.&quot; In the second edition ot the Manual, published in 
1856, he changes his opinion, and says: &quot;* * * apparently 
a hybrid between Q. Phellos and Q. tinctorial In the fifth 
edition, published in 1867, he quotes De Candolle as referring it 
to a variety of Q. aquatica, and then says : &quot; It is as likely to be 
a variety of Q. Phellos, with dilated and toothed or cut leaves.&quot; 
About the year 1855, however, some trees were discovered at Mt. 
Holly, N. J., {Fide specimen in Herb. Columbia College, marked 
&quot; Mt. Holly, N. J., Aug. 25, 1855, W. Proctor,&quot;) and others

were subsequently found at stations in New Jersey and Delaware 
by Messrs. Smith, Leidy, Burk, Martindale, Median, Austin, 
Canby, Commons and others, which have been the subjects of 
numerous papers, notes and discussions. Even in the light of this 
new material, however, I find that there is as much difference of 
opinion as ever. Englemann first considered it as a good species 
and subsequently decided that it was hybrid with probably Q. 
Phe llos diwd Q. coccinea for parents. Leidy considered it a hybrid 
between Q. Phellos and Q. palustris. S. B. Buckley says, in 
describing the tree at Mt. Holly : &quot; It is * * * in a thicket 
near several willow oaks (Quercus phellos), of which it is plainly 
one.&quot; Cope and Smith rather lean to the opinion that it is a 
variety of Q. Phellos. A number of other botanists might be 
quoted as naming m^;&apos;zV(3:r/&lt;a:, «z]^r^ and other species from which 
it may have been derived, but in nearly every instance Q. Phellos 
is mentioned as being connected with it in some way. Trees have 
also been reported from the District of Columbia, Maryland, 
North Carolina and Texas, but I have not seen specimens from 
any of these localities and the published descriptions of them are 
rather vague and indefinite. If all the localities where Q. hetero- 
phylla has been found, between Newcastle County, Del., and Staten 
Island, N. Y., were marked upon a map, they would be included 
in a straight narrow strip of country about ten or twelve miles in 
width ; and this limited belt would probably include nearly every 
specimen of this tree now definitely known to be in existence. 

The Staten Island station, is, like all the others, on the Creta- 
ceous formation. The situation is a low piece of wet, sandy wood- 
land, about a quarter of a mile from the beach. This piece of 
woodland is several acres in extent and its most conspicuous trees 
are Castanea, Pinus rigida, Quercus alba, Q. rubra, Q. stellata, 
Q. nigra, Q. coccmea, Q. tinctoria, Q. palustris, and Q. Phellos, but 
the hybrids are confined to a very limited area, not more than 
half an acre in extent and entirely within the very restricted ter- 
ritory where Q. Phellos occurs*. The immediate neighbors in 
this group at the present time are Q. palustris, Q. nigra, Q. tinc- 
toria and Q. coccinea. A careful count was made of all trees 

*In this connection it is a matter of interest to know that Q. Phellos does not 
grow in any other part of Staten Island. 



307 

which were considered hybrids, and an enumeration of twenty was 
the result. Three of these were Q. Rudkini and the others either 
typical Q. heterophylla or else members of the same series, show- 
ing Q. Phellos to be undoubtedly at one extreme and some one 
of the broad, lobed-leaved species at the other. Not more than 
fifteen trees of Q. Phellos were noted. The trees of Q. Rudkini 
are mostly low, with dark green coriaceous fohage, showing their 
relationship to Q. nigra. These, however, need not concern us, 
as I consider their proper status and relationship to be definitely 
settled, so that in what follows I shall confine myself to a discus- 
sion of the forms which include Q. heterophylla. These are evi- 
dently designed to be large, the tallest one being about 50 feet 
in height and 3 feet 8 inches in circumference, and having the 
appearance of a young and vigorous growing tree. The leaf 
and fruit of this tree are shown at fig. i, plate LXXXV. As a 
rule the largest trees are those having the leaves most cut or lobed 
and the largest acorns, while the smaller trees approach nearer to 
the Phellos type. The leaves upon each tree, however, vary a 
great deal, although there is generally enough of some one pre- 
vailing form to give to each a decided individuality, and if they 
could he arranged side by side according to leaf form a graduated 
series would be the result, showing an almost imperceptible change 
from member to member. 

The petioles are of medium length, varying from ^ in. in the 
large, deeply lobed leaves, to i^ in. in the entire leaved forms. 
The margins are either entire, wavy, lobed on one or both sides, 
or sinuate toothed with the teeth bristle pointed. In some there 
are bristles on the margin where a tooth or lobe is merely indi- 
cated by a slight inequality. As a rule they are rather thin, 
green both sides, somewhat tomentose along the midrib or at the 
junction of the midrib and main veins. In others the texture is 
somewhat coriaceous — approaching forms of Q. Rudkini. Fig. 3, 
Plate I XXXIV. represents an anomalous form, with thin, spar- 
ingly lobed leaves, covered over the entire under surface with a 
close light brown tomentum. The acorn is globose, flattened and 
with a deeper cup than the others. The general habit of the tree 
is slender and willow like, and it hardly appears to be a member 
of the series. 



308 

The venation is also a character which shows the transition 
between the simply pinnate veining of Phellos and the more 
complex branching of the broad, lobed forms. The acorns vary- 
in shape from ovoid to almost globose, and, in size, from those of 
Phellos to others almost an inch in length by ^ in. in diameter 
at the largest part. The cups are invariably saucer shaped, with 
closely appressed scales. 

I made a special journey late in the season, to ascertain, if 
possible, whether anything could be learned from the autumnal 
coloring of the leaves, but I found them to be a uniform light 
yellow, turning brown. 

From these observed facts I have finally come to the con- 
clusion that we must consider. Q. heterophylla to be a hybrid, and 
further, that one of the parents is Q. Phellos. They are invariably 
associated together, or at least the former has never been found 
except in the immediate vicinity of the latter ; and, added to 
this, we know that Q. Phellos does produce a hybrid with Q. 
nigra and that this hybrid occurs associated with Q. heterophylla. 
It would not, in fact, be a matter of surprise to me if we should 
eventually find that other hybrid forms have resulted from the 
influence of Q. Phellos over other species of the black oak 
group. As to the other probable parent of Q. heterophylla 
there is yet room for careful research, although I think that 
the discovery of these trees on Staten Island has considerably 
simplified the matter. The species mentioned by those who have 
written upon the subject are aguatica, imbricaria, falcata, coccinea, 
tinctoria and palustris. The first three may be thrown out of 
the calculation at once on account of their geographical range — 
not a single specimen of either having ever been found or reported 
within miles of our station. Coccinea and tinctoria, while show- 
ing a leaf form that is satisfactory, have acorns with deep 
cups, entirely distinct from those of heterophylla. Palustris 
has a cup of the required form, but the acorn is far too small, and 
the lobes of the leaves have a distinctive divergent characteristic 
which those of heterophylla have not. The only other probable 
species, and it is the only one which does not seem to have been 
considered by our botanists, is rubra. Why this species has not 
received the attention it deserves in this connection I am at a loss 



309 

to understand, as both the leaf and acorn are eminently fitted to 
terminate one extreme of the series of which Phellos is the other, 
as I have endeavored to show in the accompanying plates. The 
only cause for hesitation which I have in accepting this as a satis- 
factory conclusion is that I failed to find trees of rubra growing in 
the immediate vicinity, although there are a number of them only 
a few hundred yards away. We should however remember that 
this species may have been present, associated with Phellos, years 
since, at the time when the existing large specimens of heterophylla 
were produced, probably 50 or 75 years ago. It may be that 
hybridization has not taken place in many years and that the 
young trees are merely seedlings from a few originals. This idea 
is strengthened in my mind from the fact that the largest and 
oldest trees come nearest to the type of rubra, while the smallest 
or youngest trees show a preponderance of the Phellos type — ap- 
parently showing a tendency to revert back to it. Dr. N. L. 
Britton has also pointed out to me a significant fact in this con- 
nection, viz. : that throughout the region where heterophylla has 
been found Phellos, rubra, and other members of the black oak 
group occur, but that to the eastward, in the Pine Barren region, 
heterophylla or rubra are not reported, although Phellos is abun- 
dant and palustris and other black oaks are present In fact 
heterophylla only seems to occur where Phellos and rubra occupy 
a territory in common.

The collections here enumerated were sent by Dr. Mearns to 
the American Museum of Natural History, and were thence re- 
ferred to me for determination by Mr. L. P. Gratacap. A com- 
plete set exists at the Museum, and another nearly complete one 
has been placed in the Herbarium of Columbia College. A few 
duplicates have been distributed. 

It is to be hoped that Dr. Mearns will continue his botanical 
explorations; for in the recesses of the mountains of this portion 
of Arizona there doubtless occur other species and varieties as 
yet unknown to science. It is not likely that the following list 
contains the names of more than one-third of the plants which 
are to be found in the district. Dr. Eusby^s account of the gen- 
eral floral features of the country, written from studies made by 
him in 1881-1882, at the time he made his very extensive gather- 
ings which contain so much that is novel and interesting, will 
forcibly supplement my bare cataloguing of the species.

GENERAL FLORAL FEATURES OF THE SAN FRANCISCO AND 
MOGOLLON MTS. OF ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO, AND THEIR 
ADJACENT REGIONS. 

BY H. H. RUSBT, M.D. 

The territory here considered comprises three distinct regions — 
an elevated, open, somewhat barren table-land; a still more 
elevated heavy forest belt, and a low, desert, mostly sandy plain. 

The first comprises the northern and north-eastern portions, 
and is the continuation of the high plateaus of New Mexico and 
Utah. It is traversed by a number of profound canyons, with 
precipitous walls a mile or more in height, and by many others 
of less depth. It supports some isolated ridges and peaks besides 
the second region above-named. Upon them occurs some good- 
sized timber, including trees like Pinus ponderosa, Dough; P. 
edulis, Eng. ; Junijyerus occidentalis, Hook.; var. monosperma, 
Eng. ; J. pachy2Mcea, Torr.; Fraxinus pistacicefoUa, Torr., and 
Quercus of several species; the largest and most important 
being Q. imdulata, var. Gambelii, Eng., and Q. oUongifolia, 
Torr. Occasionally we see a tree of Juglans riqiestris, Eng. 
Among the smaller trees and shrubs, the most conspicuous are 
Mortis microphylla, Buckley; Cejxocarjjus parvifolius, Nutt. ; 
Forestiera Neo-Mexicana, Gray; Garry a FremonUi, Torr.; 
Rihes aureum, Pursh; Ardosiophylos ptmgens, H. B. K., and a 
number of small oaks, notably Q. grisea, Liebm., and Q. hypo- 
leuca, Eng. These elevated portions, with some river-bottoms, 
where we often find cotton-woods and sycamores and the 
gigantic Alnus oUongifolia, Torr., constitute about the whole 
of the forest area of this division. The entire level portion of 
the plateau is destitute of everything larger than shrubbery, 
characteristic among which may be mentioned the Yuccas, 
chiefly Y. haccata, Torr., and Y. angustifoUa, Pursh, Arte- 



1889.] NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. 77 

misias and Ephedras. The alkaline flats are densely covered 
with a half-shrubby growth — through which travel is nearly im- 
possible—of Dicorea Brandegei, Gray; Oxytmnia acerosa, Nutt., 
and many species of Atriplex and other Chenopodiaceous and 
Amarantaceous plants. Upon the sides of some of the canyons 
occurs an extensive growth of shrubs, but these spots for the 
most part are exceedingly dry and barren, reflecting back the 
sunshine from their bare rocks, and maintaining a temperature 
most trying to the endurance of the collector. Upon these 
plains there has once been an extensive forest growth, as in- 
dicated by the petrifactions that occur. Some of these silicified 
trunks are of great size. One that I found near Holbrook 
measured eleven feet from a point just beyond the centre on one 
side to the periphery upon the other. The remaining portion 
had separated and fallen down the hillside. 

The table-land is a never-ceasing source of surprises to us from 
the East. During the greater part of the year the surface is dry 
and desolate, of an ashy gray color; but immediately upon the 
occurrence of the annual rains it changes with marvellous 
rapidity. Within three days after the first important showers, 
a distinct tinge of green is perceptible. In a week the surface 
is of an almost uniform light green, and in from ten days to 
two weeks it presents an appearance of great luxuriance. From 
this time on, until the occurrence of killing frosts, it is a 
paradise for the collector. Among the earliest plants to mature 
are those which spring from bulbs, including several beautiful 
species of Allium and Calochortus, and a Brodiaea or two. 
Among grasses, Boutelouas and Aristidas are most abundant 
over the general surface, with Poas, Agrostis verticillata, Vill., 
Ammophila longifolia, Benth., and Setaria caudata, R. and S., 
in the low and sandy places. Among these grasses other plants 
grow, not scattered and intermingled as in the East, but each 
species occupying a larger or smaller area almost independently. 
Thus we find patches of golden Pectis, Gutierrezia, Viguiera, 
Verbesina, Hymenatherum, and Hymenopappus, showy purple 
Astragali and brilliant many-colored Pentstemons and scarlet 
Castilleias. In the slightly elevated, broken ground, where the 
growth of the grasses is disturbed, abounds the Argemone, 
showy species of Oenothera, Sidas, Malvastrums, and Sphaeral- 
ceas. One or more species of Eriogonum will be found every- 
where. E. anmmm, Nutt., and E. Wrightii, Torr., with the 
larger form of E. Ahertianum, Torr., seek the rocky places, 
while E. cernuum, Nutt., and E. racemosum, Nutt., prefer the 
grassy plains, and E. tricliopodum, Torn, E. vimineuni, Dougl., 
and the dwarf form of E. Ahertimium, Torr., grow almost ex- 
clusively in the sand. Certain plants like Rumex, Bdhia 



t8, TRANSACTION&apos;S OF THE [jAN&quot;. 21, 

oppositifolia, T. and G., Actinella odorata, Gray, Dysodia 
chrysanthemoides, Lag., D. Gooperi, Gray, Schkuhria Hop- 
kirkii, and the Hoffmannseggias, are almost characteristic of the 
water-holes, the low places where the rains settle. 

This first section extends from the eastern nearly to the 
western boundary of the territory along its northern border. 
Its western limit extends diagonally, curving toward the north- 
east, from the north-western to the south-eastern corner of the 
territory, dividing it approximately into halves. In its north 
central point the second region takes its rise, running to the 
verge of the plateau near Fort Verde, and thence skirting it to 
the south-eastward and into New Mexico. This belt, known as 
the San Francisco Forest, consists almost wholly of the Pinus 
po7iderosa. It is one of the most beautiful forests in existence, 
its effect heightened by contrast with the neighboring deserts, 
from which it must be entered. The same conditions of isola- 
tion render it one of the most important of timber resources. 
The San Francisco Mts., in which this forest takes its rise, 
have an elevation of about 9,000 ft., and rise some 2,500 or 
3,000 ft. above the general level. Their volcanic origin is strik- 
ingly apparent. To the eastward they present formidable gulfs 
and precipices, but to the westward a comparatively easy 
ascent. At the summit grow only lichens. One or two hundred 
feet below begins the alpine flora, represented in flower at the 
time I visited them, July 3d, 1883, by Cerastuims, Sedum 
rliodantheum, Gray, Arenaria scabrella, Greene, which I collected 
for the first time; Polemonium oonfertum, Gray; Luziila spadicea, 
DC., var. parviflora, and the most beautiful Primula Parryi, 
Gray. This species presented patches of radiant bloom upon 
the surface of the snow, which had covered its roots to the depth 
of several inches. Pedicularis Parryi, Gray, was abundant a 
little lower, and at about 8,000 ft. occurs the timber-line. The 
upper timber consists mostly of firs and spruces, notably the 
Pseudotsuga Dougldsii, Cav., with Pinus aristata, Eng. ; the 
Pinus p&gt;onderosa of the forest proper beginning at about 
7,000 ft. In the ravines of the upper portion of the forest we 
coWed Potentilla Thurberi, Gray, Mertensia paniculata, Don., 
Pentstemon glaucus, Graham, var. stenophyllu8, Gray, Tlialic- 
trum Wrightii, Gray, Ligusticum scopulorum, Gray, Hieraciiim 
Fendleri, Gray, Frasera speciosa, Dougl., Habenaria Tliurberi, 
Gray, and a gooseberry, probably R. lacustre, Poir. Toward the 
bottom there is abundance of Zigadenus elegans, Pursh, Erigeron 
glabellus, Nutt., and, if I remember correctly. Aster adscendens, 
Lindl. Crossing the slope at the base, we walk nearly waist- 
deep in fine pasture grasses, chiefly of the long- and short- 
leaved varieties of Festuca ovina, L., to me appearing specifically

distinct. Poas and SporoMus are also abundant, and it was 
here, I think, that I collected Agropyrum Scribneri, Vasey. 
Oxytropus LamUrti, Pursh, one of the&apos;&apos; Loco-weeds,&apos;&apos; is much 
too abundant among these pastures. Two very handsome forms 
of Senecio Fendleri, Gray, grow in dense tufts, afoot in diameter 
and one to two feet high. In the same manner grow Bu^jJiorMa 
Pringlei, Eng., and E. campestris, Ch. and Sch. A little swamp- 
land near the mountain is filled with Salix rostrata, B.ich. The 
herbage is closely cropped by the sheep, but we collect Ranun- 
culus Hooheri, Kegel {R. cardioj^hyUus), Claijtonia &apos;perfoliata, 
Don., and Geranium cmspitosum, James. Near the base of the 
mountain is a ranche, tbe door-yard filled with a luxuriant 
growth of Aster foUaceus, var. Burlcei, Gray — a rich and beauti- 
ful aster, growing in large, loose clumps, with ascending stems 
a foot or eighteen inches high. A mound of scoria in the 
distance presents a golden surface of Helenium Hoopiesii, Gray. 

This exceedingly meagre outline of the flora of the San Fran- 
cisco Mts. will apply generally to similar peaks scattered through 
this forest. On Bill Williams&apos; Mountain, however, situated 
some fifty miles to the south-west, I collected quite a number of 
additional species of interest. Among them were Heucliera 
ruhescens, Torr. ; Pentstemon Bridgesii, Gray, Berber is repens, 
Lindl., Potentilla rivalis, Nutt., var. inillegrana, W&amp;ts., Mi^nu- 
lus floribmuhis, Dough, Taraxacum, Aster jmticiflorus, Nntt, 
Polygonum Bistorta, L., Smilacina sessiUfolia, Nutt., Disporum 
tracliycarp&apos;um, several Trifoliums and a Cimicifuga in flower 
only, perhaps our G. racemosa, Nutt. 

Besides its mountain flora, the forest region has a distinct class 
of plants characteristic of the dry, stony knolls, 100 to 150ft. 
high, which abound there. Of such plants I collected Erigeron 
flagellaris, Gray, several species of Muhlenberg ia, Mentzelia 
IcBvicaulis, T. and G. (?), Si^lmralcea Emoryi, Torr._,_ and a 
species which has been referred to StephanomeriaWrighfii, Gray, 
but which I am persuaded is distinct from that species. S. 
WrigJitii is characterized by great brittleness, with a weak, soft 
root, while the specimens here referred to possessed stems almost 
as tough as those of the flax, and long, tough, and hard roots. 

The timber, though heavy over the level portion, is not dense, 
and the sharply stony surface is lightly and thinly carpeted with 
forest grasses, chiefly Sporobolus of several species, with quanti- 
ties of Muhlenbergia Wrightii, Vasey, here and there. Every- 
where thickly sprinkled among the grasses are numerous flower- 
ing species. Perhaps the most abundant plant throughout this 
region is Pentstemon Unarioides, Gray, which displays a great 
variety of forms. Other of the most characteristic species are 
Oxalis decapMjlla, H. B. K., Astragalus Arizonicus, Gray, 



80 TEAK&apos;S ACTIONS OF THE [jAN. 21, 

A. Oreenei, Gray, A. Rushyi, Greene, with rarely a specimen 
of A. Mattheiusii, Wats. — a species belonging more properly 
to the open country; Potentilla suhviscosa, Greene, Carum &apos; 
Gairdneri, Ligusticum montamim, ApIo2Mppus croceus, Gray, 
Troximon glaucum, Nutt., Senecio Arizonicus, Greene, S. 
Actinella, Greene, Actinella Bigelovii, Gray, A. scaposa, Nutt., 
and Solidago nana, Nutt.; early in the season the ground is 
aflame with the beautiful Phlox speciosa, Pursh, var. Wood- 
housei, Gray. 

Everywhere through the forest we encounter beautiful open 
parks, from a few acres to several square miles in area. Here 
the grasses are taller, often nearly two yards high, and of dif- 
ferent species. Stipa pennaia, L., var. Nco-Mexicana, Thurb., 
and S. comata, Trin., are conspicuous. Other plants which con- 
stantly occur in such locations are Senecio Douglassii, DC, 
Aster tanacetifoUus, H. B. K., A. canescens, Pursh, Hymeno- 
pappus Mexicanus, Gray, Actinella Rusbyi, Gray, the beautiful 
Gilia multif,ora, Nutt., Eriogonum cernuum, Nutt., Astraga- 
lus Hosackm, Greene, and many Eritricliiums of the Jamesii, 
glomeratum and setosissimum type. It is usually, or at least 
very commonly, in these parks that the permanent water-sup- 
plies are to be found. The soil underlying the forest consists, 
for the most part, to a great depth, of loose volcanic rock, upon 
the surface of which no stream can form a permanent bed. The 
water-courses, therefore, are far beneath the surface, but re- 
appear occasionally to form living pools of delicious water, often 
a hundred yards or more in diameter. About these springs are 
found characteristic species, sedges and rushes. Iris Missou- 
riensis, Nutt., Epilohium paniculatum, Nutt., Camjyanula 
Scheuchzerii, Vill, and the like. 

During the heavy rains, even this porous soil is not sufficient 
to absorb the entire fall of water, and it runs off through the hoi- • 
lows, very readily washing out the loose material to form ravines 
and small canyons of the very roughest class. Up along these 
canyons creep many of the lowland plants, and down them 
escape many of those of the highland, producing a richly 
varied and characteristic flora. Cnicus of several species, Lac- 
tuca pulclieJla, DC., a peculiar form of Verbena poly stachy a, 
H. B. K. (?), Synthyris p)lantaginca, Benth., Hedeoma pro- 
cumbens, Greene, a beautiful little species, Senecio Rusbyi,

lum, Gray, Helianthus MaximiUani, Schrader, and Parietaria 
debilis, Forst., are among the most characteristic of this diverse 
flora. Of these, the last six may be mentioned as becoming 
more common as we descend, and being really plants of the 
lower districts. Upon the rocky margins of these canyons, in 
localities especially exposed to the sweeping storms, occurs the 
peculiar Spircea ccespitosa, Nutt. — a stout shrub, with stem often 
an inch and a half in diameter, yet its uppermost portions are 
rarely more than an inch and a half above the rocks on which it 
lies closely prostrate. In its company are usually some shrubby 
Eriogonums, notably^, deflextim, Torr., E. microthemim, Nutt., 
and E. jlavum, Nutt. 

Continuing our descent of such a canyon until it emerges 
from the forest, there is an open, but usually grassy plain of 
greater or less width to traverse, and we stand upon the jagged 
edge of the plateaus, and gaze into some basin from one to two 
thousand feet deep, and out across the desert plains which con- 
stitute the third region of which I have spoken. At nearly all 
points upon the edge of this plateau, we find such an abrupt 
descent. Its passage is rendered still more laborious by the 
dense tangle of scrub oaks which cover it towards the summit. 
A consideration of the interesting flora of this lower region 
forms no part of the present paper. 

On the explorations conducted in this forest in 1883, I was 
accompanied by Mr. Randall Spaulding, to whose exceptional 
skill in photography we are indebted for the series of views with 
which my paper has been illustrated, and by Mr. Charles M. 
Davis and my brother, Mr. Wm. S. Eusby. Through their 
keen eyesight my list has been enriched with many of its species. 

The subject was further discussed by the President, who 
referred to his own travels in the same region some years before. 
He described a severe snow-storm on the table-land, with a fall 
of eight inches in depth, gave reminiscences of bear-hunting in 
the forests, and alluded to the cliff dwellings in the San Juan 
valley, and the remarkable and interesting scenery produced by 
the abundant growth, in many of the valleys, of yuccas, cacti, 
and century-plants.

opinion that it may occur more abundantly in more tropical re-

specimens. Basal areolation of the leaves less quadrate and 
more sinuous than figured by Dr. Braithwaite (British Moss 
Flora, ii. t. xlvii. E), but a specimen collected by him agrees 
with American specimens (see figs, a, b, 4 and 5). Capsule 
exserted on a slender, curved pedicel, 3 to 5 mm. long, erect 
and twisted when dry, less than i mm. long, prolate-spheroidal 
when young, cylindrical and ridged when old and brown ; 
operculum with a long, straight beak, just covered with the 
brownish, mitrate calyptra ; annulus none, peristome also lack- 
ing on the only specimen which still retained the operculum ; 
perichaetial leaves three, longer and stouter than the stem-leaves, 
with a short hyaline, serrulate point, twisted around the base of 
the pedicel when dry, erect-patent when moist. 

Closely resembling G. tricliophylla, Grev.,but capsule smaller 
on a pedicel longer in proportion to its size, more closely twisted 
when dry ; teeth not present on any of the old capsules. Dr. 
Braithwaithe says, &quot; short jointed filaments producing globose 
propagula at upper end, are frequent upon the leaves (1. c. 15, f. 
10) these do not seem to be at all abundant upon American spec- 
imens, but appear rather as short, bifurcating, irregular filaments, 
than as moniliform hairs.

Botanical Notes. 

The Botanical Society of Western Pennsylvania is the name 
of an organization estabUshed last October at Pittsburgh, &quot; to 
bring into communication those who are interested in Botany, to 
advance their knowledge of the subject, and to create a more 
wide-spread interest in the study of plants,&quot; in which praise- 
worthy objects the editors of the BULLETIN wish the ofificers of 
the new society the greatest success. Meetings are held monthly, 
the fourth Thursday in every month, at the Pittsburgh Library. 
From the calendar of the society recently received we learn that 
the officers for i888-&apos;89, are as follows: President, Dr. Wm. R. 
Hamilton; Vice-president, Dr. A. Ziegler ; Corresponding Sec- 
retary, Mr. J. D. Shafer ; Recording Secretary, Miss Willa Z. 
Matthews ; Treasurer, Mr. C. C. Mellor. Over 50 members are 
now enrolled. 

Heterogamy in Alniis serrulata. Passing along a road 
fringed with Alnus serrulata near Yonkers, New York, the other 
day, I was interested to note that one clump had no staminate 
catkins, and that the pistillate ones were much more numerous 
than in the normal monoecious type. A day or so later, other 
plants showing the same peculiarity were observed in another 
locality. These were marked so that they might be watched 
next season. This entire absence of staminate catkins seems to 
show a tendency on the part oi Almis to become dioecious. I 
could, however, find no plants producing only male catkins, and 
am interested to know whether any such have been observed by 
others, and whether the peculiarity noted by me has been com- 
mon elsewhere this spring. ALICE B. RiCH.

Preliminary Note on the North American Species of the Genus 

Tissa, Adans. 

By N. L. Britton. 

Botanists have had great difficulty in limiting the species of 
Sand Spurrey. There is, indeed, perhaps no other genus of flow- 
ering plants concerning whose specific composition more widely 
diverse views have been propounded. Thus we find Mr. Bentham 
in 1862 (Genera Plantarum, i. 152) regarding the species as &quot;3 
vel 4,&quot; while N. C. Kindberg&apos;s elaborate Monograph of the follow- 
ing year (Nova Acta Reg. Soc. Sci. Upsal. (III.) vii. fasc. i.) con- 
tains descriptions and figures of not less than 25. Durand&apos;s re- 
cent &quot; Index Generum Phanerogamorum &quot; repeats the Bentha- 
mian view, which Baillon also apparently defends (Histoire des 
Plantes, ix. 116) saying &quot;species ad 3.&quot; This last is the latest 
expression we have had on the subject, published indeed, during 
the past year, and we may now look with much interest for the 
dictum of the distinguished authors of &quot; Die Naturliche Pflanzen- 
familien &quot; which has not as yet treated of the Carophyllese. 

So far as North American botanists have been concerned with 
their native plants, there has not been much difference of opinion 
expressed — however much may have otherwise existed — for the 
species have never yet been systematically brought together. 
The Eastern Manuals have recognized three species; the Botany 
of California describes two (one of them also eastern), four new 
species have recently been named, another (if my supposition is 
correct) frequent in the alkaline area of the Andes, extends to 
Southern California, and still another, abundant in the Mediter- 
ranean region, is found in our Western and Southern States. I 
have not ventured to unite any of these species, nor to describe 
any more, although there are plenty of indications from the her- 
baria that other forms, species or varieties will sooner or later 
claim recognition. I have thus recognized ten species, all but one 



126 

of which occur within the United States. The apparently great 
divergence from the views of the eminent EngHsh and French 
authors above mentioned is readily explicable by stating that the 
material on which the additional five or six species I have been 
able to recognize is based, is quite new, and none of them have 
been studied by either Bentham or Baillon. It is to Professor 
Greene that I am indebted for much of the material which has 
thrown most light on the Pacific Coast forms, and he informs me 
that he has evidence of the existence of other forms, sptcimens 
of which in satisfactory amount and condition for critical study 
are not yet available. So far as the twenty-five species recog- 
nized by Ki|idberg are concerned, I am entirely satisfied that 
they are mainly artificial, and actually represent not many more 
than the three or four of Bentham or Baillon. 

It is hardly necessary that I should discuss the generic name of 
these plants; Professor Greene has very recently alluded to it in 
&quot; Pittonia,&quot; and M. Baillon has adopted it in his &quot; Histoire.&quot; 
Suffice it to say that there is no valid choice in the matter, for 
1763, the date of Adanson&apos;s &quot; Families des Plantes,&quot; is fifty-four 
years before the publication of Lepigonum, and a little more 
than that earlier than Spergiilaria. There is no doubt whatever as 
to what Adanson meant, and hence it becomes a matter of mere 
priority of publication, for which fifty-four years will be consid- 
ered ample, I believe, by even the most conservative. Adanson 
considered that the species known at his time formed two genera, 
and called the other one B?ida, under which species have been 
named by DuMortier in his &quot; Florula Belgica;&quot; this view has not 
been accepted by any recent botanist, and as Tissa occurs first in 
Adanson&apos;s work, it has priority of place and must stand as the 
generic appellation of these interesting plants. 

Through the courtesy of Mr. Redfield and Dr. Watson I have 
been able to make quite careful examinations of the materials in 
the Cambridge and Philadelphia herbaria.

Monog. 1 8, at least in so far as the North American plants are 
concerned, Lepigomim medium. Fries and L. leiospermum,¥J\ndh. 
1. c. 23). 

Stout, erect or ascending, smooth or glandular-pubescent ; 
capsule 5-8 mm. long at maturity ; pedicels short (seldom more 
than twice this length) ; seeds smooth, margined or marginless, 
or roughened with projecting points or processes, several kinds 
sometimes found within the same capsule ; leaves often much 
clustered in the axils. 

Hab. Along the whole coast on both sides of the continent, 
apparently less abundant on the Gulf of Mexico ; also about 
saline lakes and on alkaline soil in the interior. 

2. TiSSA SALINA (Presl.) [Spergiilaria salina, Presl. Fl. 
Cech. 93 {iZig,) fide Kindberg. 

Slender and spreading, low, abundantly branching, generally 
diffuse, and apparently always so in its fully developed state, 
entirely smooth ; pedicels long, slender, more than twice the 
length of the capsule, which is 4-6 mm. long at maturity and 
twice the length of the calyx ; leaves generally simply opposite ; 
seeds papillose or smooth. 

Hab. In the sand or mud of sea-beaches, more rarely (if at 
all) on the meadows, coast of New England and Canada. Not seen 
from further south than Eastport (Farlow) or South Gouldsboro 
(Redfield). 

This is an extremely well marked species, as I understand it, 
and I have little doubt that it is the same thing that occurs on 
the shores of northern Europe, although comparison with more 
European specimens is very desirable. This restricts its range 
much within the limits assigned by Kindberg, who by going 
mainly upon the seeds has included in this, as in other species,. a 
large number of diverse elements. Certainly in these two species 
the seed characters are of but little value. 

* * Species of non-saline distribution.

3. TisSA RUBRA (L.) {Arenaria rubra, L. 1. c. ; Spergularia 
rubra, Presl ; Lepigonum rubruin, Fries). 

Depressed, spreading or ascending, very leafy to the flowers ; 
stipules ovate-lanceolate, acuminate ; plants smooth or but 
slightly pubescent. 



128 

Hab. In dry, especially sandy soil along both the Atlantic 
and Pacific coasts, not seen west of the Alleghanies nor east 
of California, and generally appearing as if introduced. Indeed I 
have not met with evidence that it is really indigenous in East 
America, and from its being so common a weed in Europe, our 
plant may very likely be of exotic origin. 

4. TiSSA DIANDRA (Guss.) {Arcnaria diaiidra, Guss. El.

and Syn. 7). 

Spreading or bushy branched from the base ; stipules ovate, 
acute ; peduncles leafless or nearly so ; plant glandular pubescent. 

Hab. Galveston, Texas (Lindheimer) ; Rio Brazos, Texas 
(Drummond, 97 in Herb. Gray.) ; Sierra Valley, Gal. (Lemmon, 
1874, doubtfully referred to this species); sandy bank of the 
Columbia River, W. Klickatat Co., Washington (Suksdorf, 176); 
also collected by Mr. Henderson in the same region in 1885. Our 
plant agrees very nearly with authentic specimens from Arabia. 
Its specific separation from T. rubra is open to question.

tuberculate ; plants small and delicate, 4-8 cm. high.

6. TiSSA TENUIS, Greene in litt. {Lepigontim teime, Greene, 
Pittonia, i. 6^ (1887). 

Capsules 6-8 mm. long, twice the length of the calyx ; seeds 
smooth, plants much larger, and more branched than in the last. 

This fine species may, perhaps, better be grouped with Nos. 
I and 2, as its habitat appears to be near the sea, if not, indeed 
within its influence. 

Hab. Alameda, Cal. (Greene) ; Santa Barbara (Rothrock,

IN North America

THE GENUS ELEOCHARIS IN NORTH AMERICA. 

BY N. L. BRITTON. 
{Read October \%th, 1889.) 

The Cyperaceous genus Eleocharis was proposed by Robert 
Brown in iSio, in his famous &quot; Prodromus Florce Nova Hol- 
landite,&quot; where several Australasian species are first described 
and a large number of others, formerly known as Scirpi, are 
stated to belong to the new genus. Since that time it has been 
very generally accepted by systematic botanists as distinct from 
Scirpus, although Dr. Asa Gray appears to have been in some 
hesitation concerning this for he has described one species as 
Scirpus {Eleocharis) Wolfii. While otherwise closely allied it is 
here maintained that all the species may at once be known from 
the unispicate Scirpi, by the style-base forming a persistent 
tubercle, not confluent with the body of the achene, as it is in 
the otherwise nearly related species of that genus. 

The American forms have not been critically studied since 
1836, when Dr. Torrey&apos;s monograph on North American 
Cyperacere was published, in the 3rd volume of the Annals of 
the New York Lyceum of Natural History. Nineteen species 
of Eleocharis are there recognized, including one now referred 
to Scirpus {E, pygmcea, Torr.). Seven of these nineteen were 
described as new and six of them have stood the test of 53 
years&apos; study. To these 18 species of Torrey we may now add 
22, for I find that I can individualize 40 as North American. 
Of these, four only have not yet been collected in the 
United States, one of them {E. geniculata) not coming north of 
S. Mexico so far as I am informed, the others extending to 
Central Mexico. The United States may thus claim 36 species, 
or double the number known to Dr. Torrey in 1836. 

The morphology of the genus may be thus summarized : The 
roots are either fibrous and annual or they are accompanied by 
perennial rootstocks and thus serve as characters in grouping 
species ; the stems are simple columns, ranging from less than 
an inch to nearly three feet in height and in section they are 
terete, wing-angled, nodose or flattened ; the leaves are rep- 
resented only by sheaths or vaginoe, which terminate at their 
orifices in short teeth, in a truncate border, or in some sharply 
defined species in scarious spreading borders ; the stems are

abundantly supplied with stomata, and thus are the physiologi- 
cal equivalent of the comparatively greater leaf-surface of other 
plants. 

The flowers are borne in a several or many-flowered spike at 
the summit of the stem ; this spike consists of scales or glumes 
more or less densely imbricated, and behind each scale is a 
perfect flower, with the occasional exception that the lowermost 
scales are empty ; the flower consists of a perianth composed of 
from three to nine bristles, which are generally barbed down- 
wards, and differ greatly in length in the different species, in 
some being entirely absent and the flower thus quite incomplete ; 
in most species there are normally three stamens, but this is a 
variable character, and of but little value in classification, 
for there may be fewer in a very large number of species ; these 
stamens have flattened filaments as a general rule, a feature 
hared by many other Cyperacese ; there is a single pistil with a 
simple style which divides near its apex into either two or three 
stigmatic lobes, and this is so good a character as to be taken as 
the mark of primary division of the genus into the subgenera 
Eleogenus with two-cleft style, and Eueleocharis with three- 
cleft style ; it is further found that almost invariably the former 
have flattened or lenticular achenia, while those of the latter are 
triangular ; the surface of the achenium is smooth in some 
species, ribbed in others and again cancellate in others and 
these markings are quite persistent ; the thickened style-base or 
tubercle, is of extremely differing forms and many species can 
be determined at a glaace from an examination of this alone. 

On these morphological characters I have entirely depended 
in the grouping of the species here presented. I am not 
unaware that histological details have been invoked in the 
classification of this natural order, and I have been particularly 
impressed by the extremely minute and laborious researches of 
Palla as published in Engler&apos;s Bot. Jahrb. x. 293, but as the 
results reached by him appear to me to destroy natural alliances 
rather than to ascertain them, I have not used the arrange- 
ment of the fibro-vascular bundles of the stem as proposed by 
him. nor, indeed, have I found it necessary to invoke it. 

In point of geographical distribution the species are most 
abundant in our southeastern states. Of the ^6 species 24 
occur in Florida, and Texas is almost as well supplied. Several

appear to be extremely local, but as these plants are but little 
studied by collectors, it is not safe to assert that this is actually 
the case. Five of our species are also natives of the Old 
World, three being of general sub-tropical distribution and 
two of circumboreal range. 

Two species by recent American authors referred to this 
genus {E. pygmcca, Torr. and E. pauciflora, Link) are remanded 
to Scirpus where they originated as Scirpus nanus, Spreng. and 
S. paucifloi-us, Lightf. The one is a denizen of salt marshes on 
both sides of the continent, occurring also in similar situations 
in the Old World, and the other is a high mountain and arctic 
plant, also common to both hemispheres. 

My studies on the genus, which have been extended over 
several years, have been most pleasantly facilitated by the kind- 
ness and courtesy of Mr. C. B. Clarke, F. L. S., of the Royal 
Herbarium at Kew, who is now engaged in monographing the 
order Cyperace?e for the &quot; Monographiae Phanerogamorum,&quot; 
edited by the immortal DeCandolles. I have had the pleasure 
of much personal consultation with Mr. Clarke, and he has 
further favored me with numerous letters and notes, besides 
giving me freely a list of the species as recognized by him. 
The following enumeration is arranged as nearly as possible on 
his forthcoming vvork, differing only in some points where I have 
not been able fully to agree in his conclusions. I take this 
opportunity of expressing to him my grateful thanks for all his 
many favors. 

My gratitude is also due my many friends who have liberally 
supplied me with specimens for study and examination. They 
are almost too numerous to mention at this place, but I must 
indicate to Professor Porter, Dr. Watson, Mr. Coville, Mr. Red- 
field, Mr. Canby and Mr. Martindale the great advantages I 
have derived from the study of the material at their command.

The synonym of Pursh doubtfully referred here by Dr. 
Torrey (Ann. Lye. iii. 297), can hardly be applied to any other 
species. Kunth (Enum. PI. ii. 154), attributes the binomial to 
R. Brown, but that author says only (Prodr. Flora Nov. Holl. 
i. 224) that Scirpus inter stindus, Vahl, belongs to his genus 
Eleocharis there first propounded. Roemer&amp;Schultes (loc. 
cit.) refer it to themselves, and it appears to me, rightly. The 
same is true of many other species. Boeckeler (Linntea, xxxvi. 
474) refers the species to E. plantaginea, a widely distributed 
Indian plant but Mr. Clarke concludes that they may always 
be separated by the characters afforded by the achenia, 
although otherwise much alike, and in this conclusion I fully 
agree.

The extensive range which the above-cited localities indicate 
would appear to show that this species may be more common 
than we now know it to be. Dark glumed forms are with dififi- 
culty separable from E. ovata. Dr. Torrey reports it from 
Georgia, but there are now no specimens of it from that state in 
his herbarium, nor have I been able to trace his var. /? (Ann. 
Lye. iii. 305) ; the plant referred by me to this (in Bull. Torr. 
Club, xi. 87,) is E. albida, which long-headed forms of the

separate it from E. ovata, although some may consider this 
sufficient.

This very good species, and exceedingly interesting one, has 
suffered unmerited exclusion from our American handbooks, 
probably caused by its limited geographical range and somewhat 
inaccessible habitat on the higher mountains of Pennsylvania 
and New Jersey, so that it has been observed in situ by very 
few botanists ; all who have actually seen it growing have had 
but one opinion as to its speci6c validity. My acquaintance with 
the plant was first made some five years since on the Shawan- 
gunk Mountains in Sussex County, N. J., where I found it grow- 
ing in a deep swamp near the elevation known as High Point, 
and collected it in fruit only. In last June, however, through 
the guidance of Professor Porter, I was introduced to it in its 
typical locality on thePocono plateau in Pennsylvania, in which 
region it was first found by Pursh, and had an opportunity to 
study the plant in flower. Dr. Porter has long been of the 
opinion that it is a valid species, and I am glad of an opportu-

Botanical Club, xv. 97 et aeq. 



6 TRANSACTIONS OF THE [OCT. 7, 

nity to express my belief in the accuracy of his conclusions, 
based on the same characters as those assigned in the original 
description. 

In the Pocono localities the plant grew actually in the water, 
in cold mountain springs and brooks, and densely shaded by 
overhanging bushes. The very different habit of the C. pahtstris, 
growing in open, sunny swamps, is a fact which does not appear 
to have yet been recorded. 

Mr. Maturin L. Delafield, Jr., has communicated tome speci- 
mens of a CaUha from West Hampton, Suffolk County, N. Y., 
which I refer without hesitation to this mountain species. Mr. 
Delafield has not detected the typical C. jyalustris in the region; 
and knowing what we now do of the numerous elements in com- 
mon possessed by the floras of the Shawangunk and Pocono 
Mountains with those of the coast plains, this is not as remark- 
able as it might at first appear.&apos; 

If it should seem desirable in the future to reunite it with the 
Old World plant which has been known as C. palustris, L., 
var. Sibirica, Kegel (1861), it is to be remembered that this 
name is long antedated by (7. radicans, Forster, Trans. Linn. 
Soc. viii. 324, t. 17 (1805). But it does not appear to me from 
the materials now at hand that this will again be suggested. 
Dr. Gunther Beck, in his review of the relatives of C. pahtstris, 
in Verhand. K. K. Zool.-Bot. Ver. Wien, xxxvi. 350 (lb86), 
excludes C. flabellifolia. In Torrey and Gray&apos;s Flora the name 
is stated to be synonymous with C. dentata, of Muhlenberg&apos;s 
Catalogue (1813), but the description there given is not suf- 
ficiently explicit, and until the fact can be more conclu- 
sively shown I do not consider it safe to take up Muhlenberg&apos;s 
name.

This may be announced as a North American plant, having

Canada, by Mr. Jas. M. Macoun, July 17th, 1886. This local- 
ity lies between Hudson&apos;s Bay and Lake Winnipeg, in latitude 
about 55°. It had previously been collected by Mr. R. Bell at 
Misinaibi River, Ontario (July, 1879). Specimens from both 
localities are preserved in the herbarium of the Geological and 
Natural History Survey of Canada. The pl ant may at once be

distinguished from the eastern C. odorata var. minor, by its 
oblong leaves, sometimes nearly twice as long as broad, with 
narrow, acutish lobes, and the flowers still smaller with 7 to 8 
rayed stigma. The identification of the American and Asiatic 
plants has been made on specimens of 0. pygmcea from Khasia 
(Hooker and Thomson) and Japan (Albrecht, 1861). As to the 
relationship of Dr. Morong&apos;s C. Leibergii to the present species, 
I am not yet willing to express a positive opinion. Dr. Morong 
remarks, in his original description of the plant (Bot. Gazette, 
xiii. 124), &quot; leaves with a broad, open sinus and obtuse lobes&quot; ; 
but specimens recently received from Mr. Leiberg have the 
sinus narrow, as in C. telragona, and the lobes quite as acute, 
the laminse being of precisely the same outline ; this leaves prac- 
tically nothing but the obtuse petals to distinguish it from the 
species here discussed. Indeed, some of the inner petals are 
much the same form as those of C. tetragona. 

Professor George Lawson has also examined the Canadian spe- 
cimens here alluded to, and (loc. cit. 113) refers them to C. odo- 
rata var. minor, but I cannot agree with him in this. Curiously 
enough, in his otherwise exceedingly complete synopsis of the 
Nymphaeacese he makes no mention of C. Leibergii. 

The leaves of C, tetragona are of much the same size and form 
as those of Nymjjhcea micropliylla.

After a careful study of this plant in the field and herbarium, 
I have come to agree with my friends. Judge Day and Professor 
Macoun, that it is specifically distinct from the white-flowered 
species with which it has been associated. The specific name 
adopted appears to be the earliest one available, although it has 
never, so far as I can make out, been published except as a 
synonym. Dr. Torrey must have fully intended to print it as 
Arabis Douglassii, and was later under the impression that he 
had actually done so, for he uses the synonym on page 83 of 
the &quot;Flora of North America,&quot; referring to the place where he 
jiublished it as A. rliomboidea, var. purpurea (at least to within 



8 TRANSACTIONS OF THE [OCT. 7, 

three pages of the actual citation). This mistake has been 
copied by himself in the &quot; New York Flora/&apos; and by Dr. Watson, 
in the &quot; Bibliographical Index,&quot; where matters are still further 
complicated by the erroneous reference of the plant to Michaux&apos;s 
n&apos;otmiclifolia, although this has been subsequently corrected by 
Dr. Gray in Botanical Gazette, iv. 210. 

Besides the beautiful purple flower?, which unfold ten days 
earlier than those of C. hulbosa, in the locality near Newfound- 
land, New Jersey, first noted, I think, by Professor Joseph 
Schrenk, where I have studied the living plants, the species 
differ in the root-leaves of Douglassii being uniformly more 
nearly orbicular and the stem-leaves broader and generally more 
deeply dentate. The texture of the leaves is thicker, and the 
whole plant lower than bulbosa. I have found no essential dif- 
ference in the fruit.

I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Bennett, of Croydon, England, 
than whom no one is better acquainted with the English flora 
and its literature, for valuable notes respecting this widely dis- 
tributed species; and I agree with him and with other British 
botanists that it is distinct from C. hirsuta. So far as I have 
observed, its habitat is on rocky banks in more or less shaded 
woodlands ; that of C. hirsuta being either actually in the water 
or in very moist situations. It appears to be a smaller ])lant 
than C. hirsuta, with a decidedly flexuous stem, the leaves 
smaller and with narrower divisions. That our plants have 
always six stamens as against four in hirsuta, as stated in the 
English floras, I have not yet been able to satisfy myself fully ; 
but in those which I have had opportunity to examine this dis- 
tinction appears to hold good. I have collected C. flexuosa 
recently on the sides of Mount Mackay, near Port Arthur, north 
shore of Lake Superior.

The suppression of this species by Dr. Gray was, I judge, 
quite unwarranted; and now, from abundant material, I feel 
justified in contending for its specific rank, not from the mere 
fact of its generally developing more than five leaflets (the Vir- 
ginia Creeper has sometimes seven, as was first noted, I think, 
by Mr. Meehan), but from other characters which are more 
constant. Mr. Buckley pleaded forcibly for its recognition 
nine years later (1. c, 1870, 136), remarking on its smaller 
leaflets (comparing it with the ordinary Virginia Creeper) and 
its &apos;&apos;cymose panicles,&quot; which flower at the end of April, while 
plants of F. quinqvefolia in the same locality do not flower 
until the middle or end of June. Specimens collected by Mr. 
Tweed}&apos;, in 1879, in Tom Grreene Co., Texas, maintain the 
characters assigned by Mr. Buckley ; and the collections of 
Wright, Fendler, Bigelow, Buckley, and this last, indicate a 
wide range for the vine in western Texas. Young&apos;s &quot;Flora of 
Texas&quot; maintains the species, and the recent monograph of 
M. Planchon recognizes it as a variety at least, although that 
author had not seen specimens.

The adoption of Marshall&apos;s name saccharum for the Eock 
Maple in place of the more recent saccharinuni of &quot;Wangenheim 
(the saccharinum of Linnseus applying to the Silver Maple, as 
recently remarked by Professor Sargent in &quot; Garden and Forest&quot;) 
renders this readjustment of the varietal name necessary, if, as 
I contend, it is to be considered a variety, and I have so used it

Phaseolus helmlus, Torr.&amp;Gray, Fl. N. A. i. 280 (1838); 

Gray, Man. Ed. 5, 140, not of Linngeus. 

Phaseolus helvolus, L. Sp. PI. 724 (1753), belongs to the plant 
which appears in recent writings as P. diversifolius, Pers. It 
is therefore desirable to take up the oldest specific name avail- 
able, which appears to be that of Muhlenberg.

Yellowstone National Park, on geyserite ; collected bv the 
Kev. Dr. Charles H. Hall, of Brooklyn, N. Y., in June,&quot;l888. 
Dr. Hall collected also the S. canus, Hook., in the same 
region ; and it was the great difference in appearance of the two 
plants that suggested to me a careful comparison of their cha- 
racters. I fortunately found that a type of Hooker&apos;s species was 
preserved in Dr. Torrey&apos;s herbarium, and saw at once that the 
plant here described was different. I have evidence that it has 
been collected in other parts of the Kocky Mountain region. It 
is one of the most beautiful and interesting of the genus, its ex- 
traordinary amount of woolly tomentum fully justifying Dr. 
Hall&apos;s exclamation on finding it, — *&apos; looks as if it were done up 
in blankets.&quot;

N. Y. 32 (1888). 

Field observations on this shrub, extended over several years, 
have now convinced me that it is specifically distinct from 
F. corymhosum. Indeed, I have not been able to find any inter- 
mediate forms. Its characters were distinctly pointed out by 
Dr. Bigelow, being essentially the small cylindric corolla of a 
decidedly pink color, contracted at the throat so as to become 
somewhat ovate (5 mm. long); the light-colored bark which 
tends to become shreddy; the tomentose lower leaf surfaces; 
and the perfectly black berries without bloom. On Staten Isl- 
and and in the Pocono region, where the two species grow com- 
monly in company, they can always be distinguished at a glance, 
whether in flower or fruit. I should say that they are quite aa 
distinct as V. Pennsylvanicum and V. Canadense. 



1889.] NEW YOKE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. 11 

I have adopted Dr. Bigelow&apos;s spelling of the specific name, 
who took it from Richard in Michaux&apos;s Flora, but presume that 
it should be dissomorpJmm, as Dr. Torrey has it on page 446 of 
the first volume of the &apos;&apos; New York Flora,&quot; where he appears to 
have confounded it with V. Canadense. Dr. Gray remarks, in the 
first edition of his &quot; Manual,&quot; that the characters of the plant 
appear to be perfectly constant, but he subsequently changed 
his mind and in the fifth edition it appears only as a variety. 
In his &quot; Synoptical Flora&quot; it is given, under F. corymbosum var. 
atrococcum, as V. disocarpum, and this misprint was taken up 
in the Torrey Club&apos;s Preliminary Catalogue. 

LiMNANTHEMUM AQUATICUM (Walt.). 

Anonynios aquatica, Walt. Flor. Car. 109 (1788). 

Menyanthes trachysperma, Michx. Flor. Bor. Amer. i. 126 

(1803). 

Mr. A. 0. Apgar sends this species from a pond at Bridgeton, 
Cumberland Co., N. J., thus bringing it within the 100-niile 
circle of the New York local flora. Mr. A. Commons had pre- 
viously collected it at Millsboro, Sussex Co., Del., just without 
the limits of the local flora. 

Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb.). 

Bignonia tomentosa, Thunb. Flor. Jap. 252 (1784). 

Pauloiuaia imperialis, Sieb. and Zucc. Flor. Jap. i. 27, t. 10 

(1835). 

While hardly deserving notice under this heading, it is of in- 
terest to record that this Japanese tree has established itself in 
rocky woods at Kocky Hill, N. J., where it flowers freely, as ob- 
served by Eev. L. H. Lighthipe. 

Utricularia cleistogama (Gray). 

In the fifth edition of Gray&apos;s &apos;&apos; Manual,&quot; page 320, mention 
is made of the discovery by Mr. J. A. Paine, Jr., in September, 
1866, in the pine-barrens of New Jersey, of a few specimens of a 
minute Utricularia, with faint pink-purple corolla not larger 
than a pin&apos;s head. In the &apos;&apos;Synoptical Flora,&quot; Dr. Gray de- 
scribes this plant as U. subulata var. cleistogama, as &quot;an inch or 
two high, bearing one or two evidently cleistogamous flowers.&apos;* 
It was again collected in 1881, in wet ground along Atsion River 
below Atsion, N. J.,— also in the pine-barrens, — by Prof. J. 
A. Allen, of New Haven, Conn., who distributed some speci- 
mens. 

On August 18th of the present year, while botanizing at 
Forked River, N. J., also a region of cedar swamp and pine- 
barrens, I collected a number of specimens of a minute Utri- 
cularia with strictly cleistogamous flowers, answering the de- 



12 TRANSACTIONS OF THE [OCT. 7,- 

scription above given by Dr. Gray, and closely resembling Prof. 
Allen&apos;s collections, except that the lower lip of the corolla is yel- 
low, and the upper translucent white. There is no spur, and 
no U. suhulaia could be detected in the vicinity. 

My plants certainly represent a species distinct from U. sul- 
ulata, which I name U. cleistogama. It cannot be decided at 
the present time if these are specifically the same as the earlier 
collections, although I am inclined to consider them such, not- 
withstanding the difference in color of the flowers. 

Epidendrum Tampense, Lindl. Folia Orchid. 12, 

This species was described by Lindley from specimens sent 
him by Dr. Torrey about 1850. In looking over the genus, last 
summer, with Mr. Rolfe, at Kew, I noticed the original speci- 
men and remarked that the name had not been used in any of 
our North American book?. He assured me, and satisfied me, 
that it is a distinct species. On returning home, I investigated 
the EjncUndra of our herbarium and found the rest of the speci- 
mens, marked &apos;■&apos;Epidendrum, Tampa Bay, Florida, Dr. Leaven- 
worth.&quot;&apos; Dr. Torrey had not written the name upon the herba- 
rium sheet; and, as the part of the &quot;Folia&quot; containing the 
description was not in his library, it is probable that he was not 
aware of the publication of the name. The species has since 
been collected by Curtiss, and distributed as &apos;&apos;Epidendrum 
venosum, Lindl.&quot; (&quot;North American Plants,&quot; No. 2805. Habi- 
tat, on trees, Hillsboro Kiver, Florida). 

Oakesia SESSiLiFOLiA (L.), S. Wats.; var. (?) nitida, n. var. 
Differs from 0. sessilifolia in its smaller leaves, which are 
rough-margined after the manner of 0. puherula, and shining on 
both sides. Collected by myself, May 30th and 31st, 1887, at 
Tom&apos;s River and Cedar Bridge, Ocean Co., N. J., on the borders 
of swamps in the pine-barrens. The leaves of 0. sessilifolia, so 
far as I have seen them, are always markedly glaucous beneath 
and dull green above. The young capsules of the new variety are 
on peduncles 10 mm. long, the corolla and mature capsule not 
seen. Dr. Watson describes (Proc. Amer, Acad. xiv. 2G9) the 
capsules of 0. puherula as sessile or nearly so; but this is evi- 
dently a slip of the pen, for specimens labelled by him in the 
Torrey herbarium bear capsules on stalks 1 and 2 cm. long. 

Cyperus Buckleyi, Britt. Ball. Torr. Bot. Club, xi. 86(1884). 
This species, originally described from the Valley of the Lower 
Rio Grande, has since been found by Mr. Pringle on hills near 
Chihuahua (1040), and in the Sierra Madre (1167), and by the 
same collector in the Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona. Fred.

Muller&apos;s No. 1989 from Orizaba, and Bourgeau&apos;s No. 432 from 
Pedregal, near Mexico, appear to be the same. 

Cyperus l^vigatus, L., has recently been collected in South 
Carolina by Mr. Gerald McCarthy — the first evidence we have 
had of its occurrence on the east coast. 

SciRPUS ATROVIRENS, Muhl. var. PALLiDUS, n. var. 

Whole plant pale, including the inflorescence, which is com- 
posed of larger heads than in the type, and is more contracted; 
glumes more squarrose. A well-marked variety, but I am so far 
unable to detect further differences. The achenium is exactly 
like that of the eastern plant. Indian Territory (E. Palmer, 
No. 358, 1868); Mitchell Co., Kansas (M. A. Carleton, 1886); 
Hitchcock Co., Neb. (H. J. Webber, 1888). 

ScHGENUS NIGRICANS, L., wliicli wc have had as North Ameri- 
can from Florida only, comes now from the San Bernardino 
Mountains, southern California, where it was collected in 
June, 1887, by Mr. S. B. Parish (No. 2058). 

HoMALOCENCHRUS, Mieg. Hall. Stirp. Helv. ii. 201 (1768), 
plainly antedates Leersia, Sw. Nov. Gen. et Sp. PL 21 (1788),. 
— which is one reason why the latter should not be used, while 
another is that Leersia, Hedw. Fund. Muse. ii. 88 (1782) 
{Encalypta, Schreb.), a genus of Musci, is also older, con- 
taining those mosses which have recently been referred back 
to Leersia (Braithwaite, British Moss Flora, i. 279). 
Our northern species must receive binomials as follows: 

HoMALOCENCHRUS ORYZOIDES (L.), Poll. Enum. PI, Palat. 
(1776) = Leersia oryzoides, Sw. 

HoMALOCENCHRUS ViRGiNicA {W\l\d.)=:Leersia Virginica, 
Willd. Sp. Plant, i. 325 (1797). 

Panicum nitidum, Lam. var. pauciflorum (Vasey). 

P. dicliotoynwn, var. pauciflorum, Vasey in Columbia College 

Herbarium. 

This is a very slender, smooth grass, with a simple panicle of . 
five to ten divaricate branches, and these again very sparingly 
divided and filiform, the whole number of flowers on any single 
panicle not exceeding twenty. The flowers are larger than in 
ordinary forms of either dichotomum or nitidtmi, the stem- 
leaves linear, acuminate, distant, about 5 cm. long, the radical 
short and ovate. 

Collected by myself on a mountain east of Lake Hopatcong, 
JVIorris Co., New Jersey, July, 1884. 



14 TRANS. OF N. Y. ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. [OCT. 7, 1889. 

Panicum nitidum, Lam. var. yiride (Vasey). 

F. dichotomum, L. var. viride, Vasey, Bull. 8, Bot. Diy. U. S. 

Dept. Agric. p. 30 (1889). 

I think this a very well-marked woodland variety, but should 
refer it to P. iiitidum rather than to P. dichotomum. I have 
observed and collected it frequently in the highlands of New 
Jersey.

V. — A List of State and Local Floras of the United States 
and British America. 



BY N. L. BRITTON. 
Bead Feb. 24, 1S90. 

In the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, vols, viii, et seq., 
there are published &quot;Contributions towards a List of the State and 
Local Floras of the United States,&quot; by Mr. W. R. Gerard and 
myself. The present paper is an attempt to bring this up to date 
and supply the numerous omissions of the former work, with the 
addition of lists published for the Canadian Territory. In this I 
have been greatly aided by botanists all over the country, and it is 
believed that the present enumeration contains most of the local 
floras. No attempt has been made to incorporate all the notes and 
short lists of local observations, but it has been found difficult to 
draw the line in many cases. As in the former contribution lists 
of species without exact localities have been indicated by (A); 
those giving stations by (B); those giving stations with notes or 
occasional descriptions by (C); and descriptive floras by (D). 

I cannot hope to have covered all the literature of this subject, 
and will be grateful for further notes and memoranda in the view 
of preparing a supplementary list. The present is brought down 
to May, 1890.

oblong, curved, triangular in section. 

Missouri. — St. Louis, Engelmann ; Louisiana, Pech. 

This plant differs from H. hispida mainly in having an open, 
spreading panicle, and much smaller flowers. It may, perhaps, 
be a distinct species, but as there appear to be intermediate forms, 
it would seem best, for the present at least, to consider it a 
variety.

New or Noteworthy North American Phanerogams.— III. 

By N. L. Brixton. 

Ranunculus Porteri, n. sp. § Batrachium. Submersed, 
apparently several feet long, freely branching. Leaves petioled, 
the petioles Y^ to i&apos; long, and dilated at the base, the 
blade about i ^&apos; in diameter repeatedly ternately divided into 
linear or capillary segments ; the upper shorter and broader; 
flowers white, 3&quot; to 4&quot; broad, peduncled ; achenes 6 to 12 in a 
head, obliquely oval, compressed, somewhat pubescent, margin- 
less, very nearly \&quot; long, beakless or with a mere apiculation, 
irregularly rugose transversely ; receptacle pubescent. 

I noticed this plant in Dr. Porter&apos;s Herbarium a year or so 
ago. The accompanying label has only ** Henry&apos;s Fork, No. 
1062 ; Raiiunctilus, entirely immersed.&quot; It was collected on the 
Hayden Survey of the territories, but I cannot place the exact 
locality. 

The species differs from any form of R. aqtiatilis with which 
I am acquainted, in its much broader and fewer leaf-segments 
and larger achenia. I sent it to Mr. Baker at Kew, who thinks it 
not related to any European form of that plant, remarking that 
&quot; no European form ever shows so much transition between float- 



311 

ing leaves and capillary leaves as this does.&quot; Its affinity with 
R. aquatilis is evident, however, from its beakless, rugose pubes- 
cent achenia and hairy receptacle. 

I refer here, with considerable hesitation, the plant collected by 
Professor Greene at lone, Cal., June 7, 1889, and the species may 
occur in British Columbia.

I was first led to investigate the relations of the Old and New 
World plants which have been described under the above-cited 
names from finding them all united in the Kew Herbarium. An 
examination of the specimens there preserved and subsequent 
study of an extensive suite at home have convinced me that they 
are all one species, adding another to the list of circumboreal 
plants. In Europe it extends south to the Mediterranean region, 
in Asia to Thibet, and it apparently occurs also in Australia. On 
our own continent it has been found in Labrador by Mr. J. A. 
Allen (along the seashore, Dead Islands, lat, 52° 48&apos;) and it is 
widely distributed over the far west as far south as Utah and 
Lower California. 

Hypericmn Canadense, L. van majus, Gray Man. Ed. 5, 86 

(1867). 

A study of this plant in the field and herbarium leads me to 
think that it has good claim to specific rank. Its characters of 
lanceolate, acute, 5 to 7-nerved leaves, greater size and longer 
and sharper calyx-lobes seem quite constant. I have not seen it 
growing with the typical H. Canadense. If they could be found 
together, important evidence might be obtained. I do not pro- 
pose here to elevate it to specific rank, but only to call attention 



312 

to it in the hope that it may be investigated. Its range is given 
by Prof. Coulter (Bot. Gaz. xi. iio) as &quot;Canada to Pennsylvania, 
Illinois and about the Great Lakes,&quot; but by Watson and Coulter in 
the 6th edition of Gray&apos;s Manual &quot; L. Superior, Robbins, S. New 
York and southward.&quot; These are contradictory. Specimens 
from Vermont, New Jersey, Illinois and Iowa are preserved in 
the Columbia Herbarium.

(1873)- 

Taliimm pygmceuru, A. Gray, Amer. Journ. Sci. xxxiii. 407

There is an Australian species so named by F. Mueller in 

Fragm. Phytog. Austr. i. 175 (1858) and recognized by Ren- 

tham in Flora Australiensis. I would therefore propose for the 

American plant the name C. Grayi. 

Crotalaria retusa, L., was collected by Mr. Blodgett on Key 
West, Florida, many years ago. It does not appear to have been 
reported from the United States before, but might be expected, 
as it grows throughout tropical America. 

Lotus Helleri, n. sp. [Hosackia PjirsJiiana, Torn&amp;Gray, 
Fl. N. A. i. 327 in part). Erect, annual, divaricately branching 
1° to 2° high, finely pubescent or glabrous, leafy ; branches ascend- 
ing, 6&apos; to 8&apos; long, slender; stipules; leaves sessile, 3-foliolate ; 
leaflets linear or linear-oblong, acute, entire, the terminal one 
slightly longer stalked than the lateral ones which are somewhat 
inequilateral; peduncles i -flowered, axillary, slender, about 8&quot; 
long in fruit, leafy-bracted at the summit ; keel yellowish about 
3&quot; long ; wings yellowish, tinged with pink ; standard pale pink ; 
calyx lobes linear, equalling or slightly exceeding the tube; pod 
linear, glabrous, i&apos; to \y^&apos; long, 1)4,&quot; wide, acute, 5 to 6-seeded, 
deflexed at maturity. 

North Carolina (Schweinitz) Mecklenberg Co. (M. A. Cur- 
tis) Salisbury, Rowan Co. (A. A. Heller). Named in commemora- 
tion of Mr. Heller&apos;s recent collecting trip in North Carolina, on 
which a number of rare and interesting plants were obtained. 
Lohis Americantis, (Nutt.) Bisch. Litt. Ber. Linnaea, 1840, 132, 
[Hosackia Pitrshiana, Benth.), with which this has been con- 
founded, has larger and broader leaflets, is more villous, and has 
the calyx more deeply cleft. I believe that it has not been found 



313 

east of the Mississippi, but ranges from Minnesota to Sonora. 
The widely distributed plant of the Pacific Coast, also mixed up 
with Lotus Americajius, appears to me quite distinct, as Nuttall 
made out, describing it as Hosackia data (In T.&amp;G. Fl. N. A. 
i. 327) and there may be, as he also thought, several other 
closely related species in California and the Northwest. 

Psoralea Reverchoni, S. Wats., Proc. Amer. Acad. xxi. 449, 
originally described from specimens collected by Mr. ReverclK n 
in western Texas, in 1877, was also found by Dr. Palmer in 
the Indian Territory, 1868 (No. 72). 

Psoralea corylifolia, L. is in Dr. Chapman&apos;s Herbarium, 
ticketed &quot; Appalachicola, introduced.&quot; It is an Asiatic species, 
close to P. dentata, DC. of southern Europe. 

Cassia crotolai&apos;ioides, Kunth, var. lencopJiylla, Benth. There 
is a specimen so determined in the Kew Herbarium, collected by 
Prof. Mosely in the Grand Canon, Colorado Plateau, Arizona, 
1884. The species is known in north Mexico, and its occurrence 
in this region might have been expected. 

Ilex rnontana, T. and G. var. MOLLIS (A. Gray). Ilex mollis, 
A. Gray, Man. Ed. 2. Leaves as in the type, but pubescent be 
neath. Burgoon&apos;s Gap, Penn. (Porter). Pocono Plateau, Penn., 
collected by myself on the Torrey Club Field Excursion, June 
7-10, 1889. 

This plant was first referred to Ilex diibia (Don.), B. S. P. 
Prel. Cat. N. Y., but on comparison with typical specimens of 
this species from the Alleghanies of North Carolina, Georgia and 
Alabama, it appears hardly possible that this disposition of it is 
correct. /. diibia has broadly ovate, oval or even obovate leaves, 
which are rarely acuminate and commonly obtuse, and are much 
more densely and softly pubescent beneath. 

Ilex mollis was founded on the Pennsylvania plant, and the 
southern species subsequently referred to it. I am maintaining 
dubia as the specific name of the latter on the authority of Dr. 
Gray, who probably saw a type of it. But from Don&apos;s descrip- 
tion o{ Prinos dtibius, (Gard. Diet. ii. 20), this would not be certain, 
and he says it occurs from New Jersey to Carolina, while the plant 
which I know as dubia is not reported north of North Carolina. 



3U 

Ilex verticillata (L.) A. Gray, var. tenuifolia, Torr. 
Fl. North. States, 338 (1824). This variety with thin, ob- 
ovate leaves, glabrous, except a slight pubescence along the 
midvein on the under surface, and with mucronate-tipped, ap- 
pressed teeth, originally collected by Dr. Torrey in the cedar 
swamp at New Durham, has recently been collected by Mr. W. 
M. Whitfield at Mt. Washington, Berkshire Co., Mass. 

Var. padifolia (Willd.), T. and G. in S. Wats. Bibliog. 
Index, i. 220, is distinguished from the type by its smaller, 
thicker (almost coriaceous), broadly oval or nearly orbicular 
leaves. The original specimen in Herb. Torrey came from Lake 
Erie. The plant is common on the Pocono Plateau of Pennsyl- 
vania. 

Professor Trelease, in his review of North American species 
of Ilex in Trans. St. Louis Acad. Sci. Vol. V., does not recog- 
nize either of these varieties, but they appear to me certainly 
well-marked enough to warrant consideration. 

SpiRtEA Virginiana, n. sp. A glabrous shrub, the branches 
forming long wands, erect or reclining, i°— 4° long. Leaves ob- 
long or slightly oblanceolate, thin, obtuse or short-pointed at the 
apex, rounded or cuneate at the base, i]4&apos;-^&apos; long. 5&quot;— 8&quot; wide, 
green above, pale beneath, entire or with a few low serrations in 
the upper half; petioles 2&quot; long ; pedicels and peduncles pale 
and glaucous; flowers about 2&quot; broad, in terminal compound 
corymbs i&apos;-3&apos; across; calyx teeth 5, triangular, blunt, about the 
length of the short-campanulate tube, distinctly glaucous; petals 
5, white, ovate-orbicular, obtuse, stamens 15-20, persistent; 
styles 5-6 ; follicles in the specimens examined 5-6, apparently 
sterile, included in the persistent calyx. 

On damp rocks along the Monongahela River, Morgantown, 
West Virginia, collected by Dr. C. F. Millspaugh in flower, June 
20th, 1890, and in apparently imperfect fruit late in September. 
Collected also by Mr. G. R. Vasey in the mountains of North 
Carolina, 1878. 

Spircsa betides folia, Pall, and 5. eorymbosa, Raf , have much 
longer follicles exserted beyond the calyx, broader, thicker and 
dentate leaves, and are different in habit. Rafinesque published a 
number of species in his New Flora, but none of them can apply 
to this one. 



315 

LUDWIGIA ALTERNIFOLIA, L., var. LINEARIFOLIA, n. var. 
Two or three feet high, divergently branched, the branches as- 
cending. Leaves linear, elongated, 2&apos;-4&apos; long, i yi&quot;-^&apos; wide, 
acute; flowers soHtary in the axils of the upper leaves or bracts, 
yellow; sepals ovate-lanceolate acute, narrower than those of Z. 
alternifolia \ branches and both sides of the leaves somewhat 
pubescent. Petals apparently remaining on the plant longer than 
those of L. alternifolia, which, as Dr. Millspaugh observes, com- 
monly fall away when the plant is shocked. 

Appearing very distinct from typical L. alternifolia, but pre- 
sumably but a variety of it. From the description it may be the 
Rhexia linearifolia, Poir. in Lam. Encycl. vi. 2, said to come 
from Carolina, 

Leontodon hirtus, L., long known from the ballast grounds of 
the eastern seaports, is becoming more widely adventive. It has 
recently been collected in Southern New Jersey by Dr. J. E. 
Peters, at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, by Mr. Geo. D. 
Hulst, and on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, by Prof Ma- 
coun. It certainly claims recognition as an adventive plant. 

Popuhis Jieterophylla, L. Another locality for this rare tree 
in the Middle States has been discovered by Rev. L. H. Light- 
hipe, near Woodbridge, Middlesex Co., N. J. The stations now 
known for it at the north, besides those given in my *&apos; Catalogue 
of Plants from New Jersey,&quot; and its somewhat wide distribution 
on Staten Island, are Northport, Long Island, and Guilford, 
Conn., as recorded by Professor Sargent in his Forestry Report 
in the Tenth Census. 

Eriocaulon Kdrnicikaniun, Van Heurck et Muell. Arg. Obs. 
Bot. loi (1870). This species does not appear to have been 
alluded to by any American author. I know nothing more 
about it than the description given by the above named authors. 
The plant was collected in eastern Texas by Chas. Wright, and 
is mentioned here only to call it to the attention of our botanists. 
It can hardly be Drummond&apos;s No. 409 (second coll.), which I 
take to be E. Benthami, Kunth., although without sufficient ex- 
amination to warrant certainty. 

Cyperus phceocepJiahis, Griseb. Plant, Lorentz. 216 (1874), 
may be reported from mountains between Mazatlan and Durango, 



316 

Mexico, collected by Mr. Forrer in 1887. Specimens were sent 
me by Prof. Greene. It occurs along the Andes of South Amer-

Key West, Mr. Blodgett (Herb. Torrey and Herb. Gray). 

I went over this species with Mr. Clarke at Kew in 1888 and 
we decided that it must be new. Mr. Clarke, maintaining that 
Mariscus is distinct as a genus from Cyperiis, proposed calling it 
M. aveuicola, and if this view is to be adopted, the plant may 
bear this name. But I have not been able to agree with him in 
this respect. The species appears nearest to C. Grayii.

The Flora of the Desert of Atacama. 

By Thos. Morong. 

Under the old geographical limits, before Chile had appropri- 
ated as a war indemnity the whole of Bolivia&apos;s seacoast and three 
degrees of Peruvian soil, the desert of Atacama was figured as 
extending from Coquimbo on the south to Bolivia on the north 
and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the Andes, being nearly 
coincident with the province of the same name in Chile, So far, 
however, as the natural features are concerned, the name might 
well be applied to the entire region lying between Valparaiso and 
Ecquador, for it is all a desert broken only by lofty mountain 
peaks and deep valleys, the beds of ancient rivers, and watered 
here and there by scanty streams derived from the melting of the 
snows upon the high Cordilleras. The water from this source is 
carefully husbanded by the inhabitants of the valleys, and used 
in irrigation for agricultural purposes. Very little of it goes to 
produce the flora referred to in this article, by far the greater part 
of which belongs exclusively to the desert proper. 

It seems like a contradiction in terms to speak of a desert 
vegetation, and especially one upon a territory so bleak and deso- 
late as the Atacama, which is distinguished by the number of its 
hideously barren hills of rock and its sandy wastes. And yet 
this desert bears a flora quite extensive in the number of its species 
and very peculiar and interesting in its character. Over 500 
species of plants have been gathered within its borders, and 
probably as many more might be detected upon a close research. 
One naturally wonders by what chance such a flora can be 
brought into existence and how it can live after being once 
started. In explanation it must be said that this region is not 
absolutely rainless, although it is nearly so. There is an occasional 
winter rain, or rarely two or three showers in the course of a 
winter, occurring at long intervals. Generally such rains are 
barely enough to moisten the ground, but that little is sufficient to 
cause the seeds, which are lying dormant in the sand or the bulbs 
beneath the ground, to germinate. Once up the seedling is kept 
alive by the dews which fall nightly upon the earth, and by the 



40 

mists that hang around the hills every morning in the winter and 
spring-time. In this way these growths obtain moisture enough 
to enable them to reach maturity. Besides this the Atacaman 
plants have acquired several peculiarities which admirably adapt 
them to their conditions of life. One of these lies in the power 
of the seeds to live for many years in the dry sand without ger- 
minating. They have been known to retain their vitality for ten 
years and then to sprout at the touch of rain. 

I suspected from appearances that a special weather protection 
existed in many or all of these seeds, and Dr. Gregory of Barnard 
College, who has, at my request, kindly examined microscopic sec- 
tions of a number of species, confirms my suspicions so far as these 
particular species are concerned. The seeds in every case proved 
to have unusually thick walls and a copious supply of albumen 
around the embryo. In one instance {Pintod) she reports that the 
&quot; seed coats are heavy, the outer one having peculiar shaped cells 
which turn to mucilage on coming into contact with water.&quot; An- 
other (a Tristagjna) has &quot; copious albumen and the outer walls 
are thickened and turned in color to a dark brown, making an ex- 
tremely hard coat.&quot; Calandrinia seeds presented a coating 
&quot; somewhat heavy, but with a peculiar readiness to break on con- 
tact with water.&quot; Cristaria has an integument of several layers 
which together make a thick wall, and the interior albuminous. 
Viola shows in the seed coat a contrivance similar to that of Pin- 
toa, with more or less of albumen in the interior. 

While seeds are thus fortified against a protracted drought, 
tubers and bulbs are equally well equipped by the large amount 
of water or milk which they store up. I found many of the bulbs 
that I collected so full of juice that I could squeeze it out in a 
stream by hand. 

Another peculiarity of the herbaceous flora, evidently ac- 
quired, is the early age at which the plants begin to flower and 
fructify. As if aware that they have only an ephemeral life and 
that what they have to do must be done quickly, they are scarcely 
above ground before they put forth blossoms. Many species 
may be seen in flower when hardly an inch in height, and which 
go on flowering until they reach the stature of two or three feet — 
if they can survive so long. I was continually deceived by this 



41 

habit, naturally supposing that these wee things must be different 
in species from plants that I had seen elsewhere only as tall and 
robust when in flower. A little more experience, however, con- 
vinced me that these Liliputians were merely taking time by the 
forelock. 

Still another adaptation, excited apparently by the conditions 
under which they exist, is the extraordinary number of seeds 
formed by many plants and scattered over the soil in which they 
grow. This habit is not confined to species which usually yield 
great numbers of seeds, but seems common to all the desert flora. 
Thus a little violet which seldom attains a height of three inches, 
common about Caldera, often exhibits from thirty to forty pods 
full of seeds upon a single plant. When one looks down upon it, 
he can see only a mass of yellow flowers and fruit pods. I might 
mention many other plants in which the same peculiarity is 
noticeable. 

One other apparent adaptation deserves mention. It is said 
that a majority of the desert plants are shrubs, or at least, are 
suffruticose, and this accords with my own observation. I found 
that such growths are in the habit of shedding their leaves in the 
summer instead of winter, thus reversing the ordinary process of 
nature. By this means they reduce their vital expenditure to a 
minimum at a season when they need to husband their utmost 
strength in order to resist long and continued dryness. This leaves 
them free to exert their full powers at a period when they are 
most likely to imbibe the revivifying moisture. Aided in this by 
their thick, long and knotty roots and close, non-evaporating 
bark, these shrubs, which seem to be nothing but dead stocks in 
the summer, can withstand even several years of drought. 

After premising this much concerning the locality and the 
flora in general, I will give some account of my own explorations 
in the Desert of Atacama. It was my good fortune to reach 
Caldera, the sea-port of Copiapo, in the month of September 
last, which is early spring time in that latitude. It also happened 
to be a year when this rare flora had sprung up, a thing which 
I understood from residents had not occurred for several years 
previously. A single rain had fallen in the month of June, and 
at the time of my visit the plants were in full bloom. Had the 



42 

visit been made two months later, I was assured that not a flower 
would have been in sight. 

The sandy slopes around Caldera, especially where the soil 
was shaded by rocks, bore quite a number of species, the most 
common of which was a dusty-looking composite {Encelia tomen- 
tosa, Walp.) with pale yellow ligulate flowers, known popularly 
as Corona de fraile, so-called from the convex mass of disk 
flowers which remind one of the shaven crown of a priest&apos;s head. 
Several other species of Compositae also occur in this vicinity, 
such 2&amp;Polyachyr7is fusciis, Walp., a tomentose plant with much 
dissected leaves and showy, oblong, close-flowered heads of 
purple florets, Clmquiraga acicularis, Don., a half shrubby, 
bushy, and very forbidding plant, which has crowded spine- 
tipped leaves, and small heads with yellow spinescent scales, and 
a Closia, the flowers and odor of which put one in mind of our 
Chamomile. Two delicate Cuscutas twined about small plants 
on the open sand, on^ of them with silk-like stems and white 
flowers, and the other with masses of purple blossoms. Both of 
these are popularly named &apos;&apos;Cabellos de angel,&apos;&apos; Angel&apos;s hair. 
Lying close against the sides of rocks was a queer Asclepiadace- 
ous. shrub known as Cynoctonum viride, Phil. The stock which 
manages to survive the summer is short and stumpy, with a thick 
head like an old pollard willow, from which it sends out new greep 
shoots whenever the winter rain falls. Out upon the open sand 
one frequently meets with Frankenia aspera, Ph., throwing its 
dark colored branches over the ground, Scilla triflora, Ph., a 
bulbous plant with erect stems and racemes of pretty white flowers, 
and Oenothera Coqnimbensis, Spach., one of the species noticeable 
for commencing to flower when not much larger than a needle, 
and continuing the process till it is two feet in height. Here too 
I collected several species of Eritrichinm, Heliotropiuni, Ostcocar- 
pus, Tctragonia, and other plants which there is no room to 
mention. 

After rambling over the Caldera sands till my feet grew weary, 
I made a number of expeditions on horseback and by rail to more 
distant points. One of these was to a gorge among the hills 
seven or eight miles north of Caldera, known to the people as the 
&apos;&apos;Quebrada (ravine) d^ los leotiesy \ was informed that the name 



43 

owed its origin to the fact that in former years a number of 
pumas or Chileno lions had been killed in the ravine. Here also 
lovers of the chase had often come to hunt the guanaco, an ani- 
mal somewhat smaller than the llama, but belonging to the same 
family. Neither lion nor guanaco, however, appeared to welcome 
me to his lair, a circumstance which I did not much regret. On 
the way to this mountain defile we rode along the sea-shore for 
several miles, and then struck inland over a wide track of loose, 
shifting sand into which our horses sank nearly half way to the 
knees, and which is continually blown about by the wind. Along 
this route I gathered a number of interesting plants. Among 
them was a Calandrhiia, the common name of which is ^&apos;Pata de 
guanaco,&apos;&apos; or guanaco&apos;s foot, so-called from the fancied resem- 
blance of the shape of its leaves to the hoof of the guanaco. 
This elegant flower throws up a tall, branching stem, each branch 
bearing on long naked peduncles several large and brillant pur- 
ple blossoms, a conspicuous object upon the desert. Another 
species, or perhaps only a variety of this, much smaller in size, 
grows near the sea-shore, having a bright yellow corolla. In clumps 
around which the sand is often heaped in ridges as if against a 
wall occurred an odd-looking, yellow-flowered shrub of the 
Apocyneae, {Skytant/ms aciitus, Meyen), popularly named 
&apos;^Cuerno de cabra,&apos;&apos; or Goat&apos;s horn, from the singular habit which 
its long, pointed follicles have of twisting themselves into the 
shape of a pair of goat&apos;s horns. The resemblance is so exact, 
that every one calls them by that name at first sight. In similar 
situations is found an Ephedra, vulgarly &quot;Pingo-pirjgo,&quot; the naked 
sharp-pronged stems of which seem just in place in such a region. 
We frequently rode through mounds of sand in which clumps &apos;of 
these two shrubs were completely buried. 

Farther along the sand was firmer, but attended by a new 
danger to the horseman. A small lizard, of a livid color and 
some six or eight inches in length, the only animal that we en- 
counted in our excursion makes its burrow in these inhospitable 
wastes. As the animal is quite gregarious in its habits, we often 
came upon spaces entirely honeycombed by scores of these 
little creatures. Riding incautiously upon such ground our 
horses would suddenly sink over the fetlock into these burrows 



44 

and stumble badly, running great risk of breaking a limb or 
throwing the riders over their heads. About such spots, however, 
some charming flowers were obtained. One of these was Criick- 
shanksia Geisseana, Ph , an elegant plant, covered with masses of 
showy yellow flowers, very fragrant, and remarkable for its in- 
volucral, long-stiped sepals. Another was a Bignoniaceous 
species, named Argylia, which has long, finely dissected radical 
leaves, and a scape ten or twelve inches high, having a large 
cluster of yellow trumpet-shaped flowers at the summit. Still 
another plant of much interest, growing in clumps, was an Um- 
bellifer called Eremocharis, a tall almost naked stemmed under- 
shrub, with long internodes and curious subbipinnatifid leaves, 
which emit the odor of apples when first plucked or bruised. 

Along this route also grew some of the most peculiar Cacti 
that I had ever seen. The most noticeable of all belongs to a 
genus created by Philippi, and is, I believe, confined to this 
desert, named Eidychnia brevijlora. It throws up from a clus- 
ter of roots numerous columnar stalks about as large in diameter as 
a man&apos;s arm, and armed with innumerable long, unequal, needle- 
like spines. The flower is on the summit of the stalk, not unlike a 
large cup in aspect, the lower part of which is covered with 
crinkly velvet hairs of a lavender hue, above which rises a single 
row of stiff white petals, including a host of delicate stamens. 
Another Cactus of the melon variety, not over eight inches high, 
and not unlike a pineapple in shape, has its spines twisted about 
the stem so that they resemble a bird&apos;s nest, inside of which the 
small red flowers hide like eggs. 

When we reached the Quebrada, we found it to be a very 
rocky ravine running up the hillside between two eminences, 
along the slopes of which were heaped many boulders, as if car- 
ried down there by floods in former ages. Among the rocks 
trickled a small stream of water, which soon lost itself in the sand 
at the bottom of the ravine. As the day was quite warm, and I 
was heated and tired with my long ride, it sounded very pleas- 
ant to hear the gurgling of water, and as I have often done on 
sucli occasions in the White Mountains, I hastened to scoop up 
a drink in the hollow of my hand. My companion, a native 
Chileno, laughed at my motions, and with good reason, for I had 



45 

no sooner tasted the water than I spit it out with disgust. Who 
could drink brine ? 

All the pools and rivulets which occur in this region absorb 
more or less soda from the soil, which seems everywhere impreg- 
nated with this mineral. Luckily we carried with our lunch a 
bottle of the condensed water used in Caldera, or we should have 
been unable to quench our thirst. For this disappointment I 
was consoled by finding a number of beautiful flowering plants 
among the boulders that filled the ravine. 

The most attractive of the plants were a very handsome species 
of Alstrmneria, which exhibited great lilac flowers, the petals 
streaked with blue veins and yellow blotches, and a tall Centaiirea 
with white heads as gay looking as those of our Ox-eye daisy. 
A shrubby Euphorbia, five or six feet in height, with large white 
flowers, was abundant. This plant possesses a copious milky 
juice which pours from every wound made in its stem or leaves, 
and from this property is popularly called Lechero (milkman) and 
hence has been named by Philippi E. lactiflua. A pretty Stachys 
peeped from under the rocks whose shade it loves, and a broad- 
leaved, clammy Nicotiana and a Solamim, heavily laden with 
trusses of bright purple blossoms grew in more sunny spots. In 
this vicinity also flourishes a flower greatly coveted by the inhabi- 
tants of Caldera and called by them Anuna {Habranthus amina 
Phil.). It springs from a bulb of the size of an onion and bears 
at the summit of a tall scape a cluster of yellow tubular blossoms. 
The most charming of all the plants collected in this quarter is a 
Tropaeolum {T. tricolor, Lind.) a delicate vine which climbs upon 
shrubs in thick masses, profusely decorated with spurred corollas 
whose bright tints of orange, red and blue offer a standing invita- 
tion to all the humming birds that live in the vicinity. 

A few days after returning from this excursion, I made 
another in the company of a friend to a craggy hill known as the 
Morro, some ten miles south of Caldera. Morro is a Spanish 
word denoting any object that is round and over-hanging, and is 
applied on the coast to high rounded promontories that project 
into the ocean. Our route to this promontory lay by the seaside, 
around a lovely bay and across a beach two or three miles in ex- 
tent, which at low tide is as smooth and hard as a floor. So 



46 

beautiful was the day and so pleasant the ride by the sparkling 
blue waters of the Pacific, that even if there had been no botani- 
cal interest in the trip, I should have been more than satisfied. I 
returned, however, with my portfolio full of specimens of unique 
interest to the botanist. Before reaching the seashore or upon 
its borders, we passed through clumps of various species of No- 
lana, Dolia, Phaca, Malesherbsia, Suaeda and other plants which 
I will not attempt to describe. One species, however, deserves 
mention on account of its eminent fitness for a desert life, and 
that is an Etiphorbia^ named^. Copiapina by Philippi. It has a 
multitude of short stems which rise directly from a huge under- 
ground tuber, and lie in a circle upon the ground. The stems, 
leaves and flowers are lurid in hue as if burnt by a tropical sun, 
and the tuber, in aspect much like a big turnip, is full of milk. 
Other things might perish in that rainless climate, but such a 
tuber would be preserved for many years in the dry sand. 

It was a very rugged and precipitous ascent that we had to 
climb when we struck the Morro. In places there was no path, 
the rocks were sharp, and the feet of our horses were continually 
sliding out from under them. In spite of such obstacles we 
finally reached the summit, and then hobbling our steeds we sat 
down to rest and to look around us. The view seaward was- sim- 
ply magnificent. The broad Pacific stretched out in its illimit- 
able vastness towards the west, and the coast line of sandy plains, 
hillocks and rocky capes, indented by beautiful bays and estua- 
ries, could be seen for miles until it faded into haze. Around us 
were jagged clififs and deep precipices descending to the sea, but 
to my amazement a garden of beauty clothed the few patches of 
soil which lodged upon the summit and in the crevices of the 
rocks. Here were in this savage looking place at least a score 
of the finest species of flowers that I had yet discovered in the 
Atacama. Nolana elegans, Ph., fairly hid the backbone of the 
highest ridge with its bells of blue. AchyropJioriis, a Composite 
with large golden heads, adorned the lower slopes. Fine speci- 
mens of the Calandrinia and Alstroemeria already collected at 
the Quebada de los leones added their bright hues to this moun- 
tain park. Loasa Urinenetcs, Ph., ran over other plants or trailed 
upon the ground. A handsome Verbena and a little Gilia en- 



47 

livened the scene. Several species of Oxalis occurred in sandy- 
nooks, the most curious of which was O. gigantea, a thick watery- 
stemmed shrub, as high as my head, the upper part of the stalk 
bearing a long spike of yellow flowers arranged irregularly around 
the rachis. Here, too, is found the only Tillandsia known in the 
region (7! Geisseana, Ph.), which is, strangely enough, a cactus 
epiphyte. Many other interesting species besides these were 
added to my collection in this attractive spot, not the least valu- 
able being six or seven rare lichens. No doubt the remarkable 
fertility of this rugged headland is owing to the clouds which 
bathe its brows with moisture every night and morning in the 
months of August, September and October. 

I have space only to give a brief sketch of an excursion that 
I subsequently made by rail from Caldera to Monte Amargo, 
twenty-five miles inland. The engineer, a pleasant and well-in- 
formed Englishman, invited me to take a seat with him in the 
engine where, he said, I could survey at my leisure the road and 
the arid pastures on which the mules were feeding. I saw num- 
bers of mules, it is true, and in fact, as they have a special fond- 
ness for collecting in droves upon the railroad track, we came 
near running over some of them, a calamity which I learned was 
by no means infrequent, but what the creatures could find to 
feed upon passed my comprehension, unless it were a very disa- 
greeable plant that seems smeared with varnish over all its parts, 
and known from that fact as Alona vernicosa. An animal which 
could browse on such herbage must be quite able to relish tar, 
varnish and such-like substances. This plant occurs all along 
the railway to Monte Amargo, and bears a very pretty bright 
blue flower. Possibly it was the flowers that attracted the mules, 
as it could not have been the taste. 

Monte Amargo itself is only a railway station situated in a 
soda swamp. In the alkaline pools around it I gathered several 
species of Characeae and Naiadaceae, and in the bogs were grow- 
ing a number of saline plants such as Salicornia {S. Peruviana, 
HBK.), Triglochin and several Cyperacese. Through this swamp 
runs the Copiapo River, or rather the modicum which is left of 
it after being used for irrigation in the valley above. It goes no 
further, being here absorbed by the desert sands. Upon its 



48 

banks I saw for the first time the Chanar tree {Gotirliea Chilen- 
sis, Clos.), a sturdy close-branched, somewhat spiny shrub, which 
at the time of my visit was loaded with its bright yellow flowers. 
This shrub yields a toothsome fruit something like a plum, that 
is greatly relished by man and beast. It is often dried and car- 
ried as food upon journeys. I saw old stones lying under the 
trees which had been gnawed into by desert rats, which are ex- 
travagantly fond of the kernel. Here, too, was a gigantic Jicn- 
ciis, its numerous thorn-pointed stalks ten feet in height and 
spreading in all directions like chevaux de frise. It required 
considerable courage to thrust the hand among these spears in 
search of specimens. 

Out upon the open sands I came upon a flora different from 
any previously collected. Here I began to meet with the Ades- 
inias which are so numerous on the Pacific coast. Philippi enu- 
merates 134 species that occur in Chile alone. More than a 
dozen of them have been discovered in the Atacama Desert. In 
this locality likewise flourishes Eritrichuim giiaphaloides, DC, 
which the inhabitants of the province of Copiapo call Te del burro 
or Te del campo, and of which they make an infusion and drink 
like Chinese tea. The Acacia Cavenia and Lyciiun Chilense 
stand like lonely sentinels upon the desert. Many other things 
rare and interesting greeted me in my wanderings over this re- 
gion, but they cannot be noticed here. Of course the cosmo- 
politan plants, which go wherever man goes, were here to nod 
their familiar forms in my face. Sonchiis oleraceiis, Solamim 
nigrjiin, Erigeron Canadense, Argemone Mexicana, Raphaniis 
sativus, Erodium ciciitariiim, Gnaphalmm purpureum, and half a 
dozen other old friends were there to make me feel at home in 
this strange and distant land. 

I was pretty well fagged out with my day&apos;s tramp when I 
heard the puffing of the train on its way back from Copiapo. My 
good friend, the engineer, was kind enough to respond to the 
waving of my handkerchief by stopping the cars and giving me a 
snug seat in the locomotive. Of my three rides none proved 
more enjoyable or botanically more profitable than the one on 
the iron horse to Monte Amargo.

Mistaken for G. Hartmanni, Schimp. (BULLETIN, xvi, 340, 
and Rev. Bryol. xvii, 16) which it so closely resembles that the 
figures given by Husnot (Muse. Gall. t. xxxix) and Braithw. 
(Brit. Mosses, t. xlviii.) would do for either. Specimens were 
sent to M. Philibert, whose excellent description in the Revue Bry- 
ologique xiv. p. 50, seemed to me to answer perfectly to my 
specimens. He kindly sent me fruiting specimens from Corsica, 
which differ in the plants being much larger, with stems 6-^ cm. 
long, leaves much twisted and secund, narrower and longer, much 
less deformed by propagula; with cells much more sinuous and 
the teeth of the peristone less papillose and bifid? so drawn by 
Mr. Anderson to whom I sent the only perfect peristome of G. 
Hartmanni. But it is evident that this is not always true, for 
Philibert says of these same Corsican specimens &quot; Dents lanceo- 
lees-lineares, obtuses, entieres, d&apos;un rouge orange assez pale; 
tres-lisses dans les deux tiers inferieurs ; le tiers superieur, lei^^ere- 
ment papilleux.&quot; Ours are not obtuse, bright red not orange- 
colored, and conspicuously papillose. The difference between 
figs. 28 and 35 is also not so great in all specimens, these being 
extremes. 

Dedicated to M. H. Philibert, Prof honoraire de la Faculte 
de§ lettres, Aix, Bouches-du- Rhone, France, who has kindly 
furnished me with fruiting specimens, and who says: &quot; Je croix

Notes on North American Halorageae. 



By Thos. Morong.

Notes on North American Haloragese. 

By Thomas Morong. 

The order Haloragece consists mostly of aquatic plants, and, 
as arranged by Bentham and Hooker, comprises nine genera, 
four of which occur in northern North America and one other in 
southern Mexico. These genera differ widely from each other in 
some important points, but so far as the structure of the ovules 
and embryos is concerned, form a very natural family. The 
Order was formerly classed by most botanists with the Onagraceae, 
and in some botanical works many of the genera are still retained 
in that family, but they evidently differ radically from the mem- 
bers of that Order in nearly all the essential ordinal character- 
istics. Ceratophylhim was included among the Haloragece by 
Bentham in his Flora Australiensis, but probably by mistake, 
as the peculiar embryo, the four verticillate cotyledons and the 
exalbuminous ovules of CeratopJiylhmi absolutely forbid its intro- 
duction into this group of plants. Curiously enough, too, 
Bentham&apos;s own ordinal description debars this genus from a place 
here. 

The only objection to the arrangement of Bentham and 
Hooker which is likely to be made is in regard to the position of 
Callitriche, which has commonly been regarded as unique and 
as constituting an Order by itself Upon a careful examination, 
however, it cannot be doubted that in habit, in its four-carpelled 
fruit, its ovules and embryos, this genus bears a very close rela- 
tionship to MyriopJiyllum, while in the stamens and styles it 
strikingly resembles Hippuris, especially those forms of H 



230 

montaiia which are monoecious. By some good judges, Calli- 
tricJie has been included among the EtiphorbiacecB, with which, 
indeed, it has affinities, but from which it is widely divergent in 
having two styles and four- celled, indehiscent fruit, as well as in 
other characters. 

The species as found in our country are, as a rule, strictly 
aquatic, but not invariably so, as a few of them grow on mud or 
moist ground by the side of streams or ponds, and two species of 
Callitriche make their home under the shade of houses or in the 
woods. 

About thirty species are found in Canada and the United 
States. 

The genera agree in having pendulous, anatropous ovules, 
nut-like or drupaceous, indehiscent, angular, costate or winged 
seeds, and a fleshy albumen with the embryo in its axis. 

They may be briefly distinguished as follows : 
Stamens one. 

Ovary one-celled. Leaves verticillate, linear or obovate. 

I. Hippuris. 
Ovary four-celled. Leaves opposite, linear or spatulate. 

2. Callitriche^ 
Stamens two to eight. 

Fruit triangular. Leaves alternate, pectinate or pectinate- 
pinnatifid. 3. Proserpinaca. 

Fruit four-sided. Leaves verticillate, subverticillate or scat- 
tered. The emersed entire, toothed or pectinate, the sub- 
merged pinnatifid. 4. MyriopJiyllum. 

I. Hippuris. L. Gen. PI. n. i. (1737). 

Flowers small, axillary, perfect, or by abortion sometimes 
neutral or pistillate. Apetalous. Calyx tube adherent to the ovary, 
the limb minute, entire. Stamens one, in the perfect flowers 
inserted on the margin of the calyx. Style filiform, stigmatic its 
whole length, and lying in a groove of the anther. Drupe one- 
celled, one-seeded. Only three species are known, all occurring 
in North America 

Leaves linear, acute, six to twelve or more in a whorl. 

I . H . vulgaris. 



231 

Leaves usually oval or obovate, obtuse, four to six in a 

whorl. 2. H. tetraphylla. 

Very small Arctic plants, with linear, mucronate leaves, 

five to six in a whorl. 3. H. montana. 

1. H. vulgaris. L. Sp. PI. 4. (1753). 

Springing from a perennial rootstock, with annual, simple, 
erect stems and whorls of six to twelve or more one-nerved linear 
or lanceolate leaves which are more or less decayed (sphacelated) 
at the tips, and 10-20 mm. long by 1-3 mm. broad. Stamens 
with short, thick filaments and comparatively large two-celled 
anthers, which dehisce laterally. Fruit oval, or somewhat four- 
sided, hollow in the interior, 2 or 3 mm. long, stigmas persistent. 
Common in Arctic America and Canada, It occurs also in Moose- 
head Lake, Maine (Porter), west to Oregon, and thence to 
California (Parish) and New Mexico. Mr. Safford sends it from 
the Straits of Magellan, and it is common in Europe and Cen- 
tral Asia, 
Var. fluviatilis. Hart. Scand. Fl. 150 (1849). 

A very luxuriant, deep water form, entirely or nearly sub- 
merged. Leaves 6 cn&gt;: long by 2-3 mm. wide, grass-like, nu- 
merous, in closely crowded whorls. Lake Winipeg (Macoun), 
Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan (Robbins) and Oregon (Lyall). 
Not uncommon in Sweden. 

2. H. tetraphylla. L. f Supp. 81 (178I). 

H. lanceolata. Retz. Obs. Fasc. 3, 7, t. i (1783). 
H. maritima. Hell. Dis. Hipp, in Ust. Opusc. L il. t. 
I (1786). 
This is usually a smaller plant than the preceding, rarely at- 
taining a height of over 20 cm. Sometimes, however, as in 
Labrador specimens, twice that height. The leaves are in whorls 
of fours or sixes, oval, obovate or occasionally oblanceolate, but 
little, if at all, decayed at the tips, and often feather- veined. Fruit 
less than 2 mm. in length. It ranges from Alaska and Hudson&apos;s 
Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and from Sweden to Siberia. 

3. H. montana. Ledeb. in Reich. Bot. i. 71 (1827). 

This diminutive northern plant, as Torrey and Gray remark, 
(Fl. N. A. p. 531), looks very much like a small Galium. Stems 
3-6 cm. high. Leaves one-nerved, linear, mucronate, in fives 



232 

or sixes, 5-6 mm. long, not decayed at the tips. Often monoe- 
cious, the flowers consisting of a single stamen or a single pistil ; 
sometimes all the flowers in the axils of the whorls staminate. 
Stamens as long as the ripe fruit ; filaments thick : anthers 
large. Fruit almost oval, minutely granulated, a little over i 
mm. in length ; the persistent style shorter than the nutlet. 

Turfy places in Siberia, Alaska and the Selkirk Mountains, 
British Columbia (Macoun). 

2. Callitriche. L. Sp. PI. 969. (1753). 

Widely dispersed over the earth in warm and temperate cli- 
mates. As usually reckoned, it numbers about twenty species, 
one half of them occurring in the United States. In some cases, 
however, the species run so close to each other that they can be 
distinguished only by fruit markings. In this paper Hegelmaier&apos;s 
classification of our North American forms is retained more for 
the sake of avoiding the creation of new synonyms than for any 
other reason. A stricter grouping would probably throw C. verna, 
C. stenocarpa, and C. Bolanderi into one. It is doubtful, too, if 
C. verna and C. JieteropJiylla should be considered as distinct 
species, since they can be separated only by the fruit, and are 
constantly confounded. Each of them, also, varies more or less 
in the shape of the fruit, so that it is not always easy to place the 
specimens. 

The leaves of most or all the species are covered on 
both sides with dark, colored dots termed by Engelman 
&quot; stellate scales, &quot; and by Hegelmaier &quot; stellate hairs. &quot; Under 
the microscope they appear to be composed of a dark ring in 
which is a slightly sunken disc with a minute cell in the centre 
from which radiate lines dividing the disc into several cells. 
They are more numerous in the aquatic than in the terrestrial 
species, in the former usually having four cell divisions, and 
in the latter eight, or sometimes split into twice as many 
divisions. 

Authors have generally regarded the flowers as monoecious, 
calling the stamens and pistils separate flowers, although they 
may stand side by side in the same axil and enclosed in the same 
perigonium. In respect to this I am bound to say that I agree 



233 

with Mr. Joseph Schrenk,* who observes &quot; there is no reason why 
we should separate these two organs and call them two different 
flowers, when, in fact, they could not be any more closely con- 
nected than they really are.&quot; In the perfect flowers the stamens 
are clearly hypogynous, proceeding, as Mr. Schrenk states, from 
the same vascular bundle of which that of the pistil is a branch. 

The flowers in most of the aquatic species are enclosed in a 
pair of small falcate or semilunar membranous bodies, which are 
by most authors termed bracts, by some a perianth, and by Mr. 
Schrenk in the article referred to floats. It is not easy to decide 
certainly upon the office of these bodies, but the explanation of Mr. 
Schrenk is ingenious and has several good reasons in its favor. That 
they are sacs containing air is evident. They are also most vig- 
orous in the rosette of floating emersed leaves, where they would 
be of most service if really intended to impart buoyancy to the 
plant, decaying or shrivelling as the stem elongates. Another 
thing which seems to confirm this theory is the fact that they are 
wanting in the terrestrial species, but then, on the other hand, 
this is equally true of ^. aiitumnalis, which is entirely submerged. 
Whatever may be the truth in regard to these bodies, we may 
properly speak of them as perigonial sacs. 

As a rule, the flowers of Callitriche are diclinous, consisting of 
a single stamen or a single pistil, but in some species they will be 
either all perfect, or, whenever the stamen is lacking, two pistils 
in the same axil. Filaments elongated ; anthers reniform, two- 
celled, dehiscing by side slits which finally flow into one across 
the top. Styles two, filiform, papillose. Fruit sessile or on peduncles, 
which in some species are greatly elongated at maturity, corn- 
pressed, four-celled, more or less winged or keeled on the mar- 
gins, four-lobed, the lobes united in pairs so as to form two discs 
with a groove between them, separating at maturity into four 
flattish carpels, each containing a single seed. 
Fruit pedunculate. 

Perigonium none.

Terrestrial, 2-4 cm. high, growing on damp soil in shady 
woods. Leaves spatulate or obovate, three- nerved, 3-4 mm. 
long and nearly or quite 2 mm. broad, tapering at base into a 
short margined petiole. Fruit about ,^ mm. long by j^ mm.

length of the peduncle, the one regarded by Hegelm. as the type 
with peduncles 3-5 mm. long, and fruit somewhat larger than 
in ours. 

New York to Washington, D. C, west to Missouri, Ar- 
kansas, Louisiana and Texas, Central and South America. 

2. C. margviata. Torr. Bot. Whip. Ex. 135(1856). Hegelm. 
Verhand. Bot. Brand. 9, 12 (1867.) 

Amphibious, usually floating, sometimes growing in mud. 
Submerged leaves linear, one-nerved, running gradually into the 
emersed, which are oblanceolate or spatulate, and three-nerved, the 
blade 4-6 mm. long and about 2 mm. broad. Styles as long as or 
shorter than the fruit, reflexed, deciduous. Fruit i-i/{ ^^m- long 
and 1^2-1^ mm. broad, with conspicuous membranous wings

3. C. Niittallii. Toriv Bot. Whip. Ex. 135 (1856). 

C . pediincidosa. Nutt. Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. Vol. V, n. s. 140 
(1837) not Arnott nor C. pedunciilata, D.C. 

A small terrestrial species growing in moist grounds. Leaves 
all spatulate, three- nerved, the blade 3 or 4 mm. long and i-i^ 
mm. broad, often finely wrinkled or granulated, apparently with- 
out stellate scales. Fruit thick, deeply emarginate at apex and 
base, \-\ mm. in length and ^-i mm. in breadth, the lobes with 
narrow marginal keels. Styles erect, longer than the fruit, decid- 
uous. This and the following species are peculiar in bearing the 
fruit on reflexed peduncles and burying it in the mud. 

First discovered by Nuttall in Arkansas and described by him 
under the name C. pedtinctdosa, but, unfortunately, the name had 
been already preoccupied.. It extends down the Mississippi to 
Louisiana. (Hale, Langlois.) 

4. C. sepnlta. S. Watson. Proc. Am. Ac. 14, 298 (1879.) 

A small terrestrial prostrate species, similar in general ap- 
pearance and habit to the preceding. Leaves linear, one-nerved, 
3-5 mm. long, somewhat wrinkled or granulated below, as in 
C. Niittallii, and apparently without stellate scale. Styles elongated, 
reflexed, soon deciduous, Fruit thick, about y^ mm. long and 



236 

I mm. broad, with very narrowly winged, divergent lobes, deeply 
emarginate at both ends, usually somewhat smaller than in the 
preceding species. 

Oregon. Coll. E. Hall (No. 459) 1871. 

5. C. longipedunculata, n. sp. 

With thread-like stems ; leaves all spatulate or oblanceolate, 
3-8 mm. long, the blades 1-2 mm. broad, rounded at the apex 
and sloping into narrowly margined petioles often longer than 
themselves, dotted with stellate scales, three-nerved, the lateral 
nerves running into each other very near the apical margin. 
Perigonial sacs longer than the fruit. Styles much longer than 
the fruit, erect, deciduous. Peduncles lengthening to 10-25 
cm. at maturity, and frequently two or three proceeding from the 
same axil, or a little below it. Fruit thick, nearly orbicular ^-i 
mm. long by about X mm. in breadth, minutely emarginate, the 
lobes divergent, with a deep intervening groove, obtusely 
margined, and with or without a very narrow wing. Nearly 
allied to a species in the Torrey Herbarium from Constantinople 
labelled &quot;6&quot;. muscoides, Goldbach,&quot; which has peduncles nearly 
as long, but with different leaves and fruit. A well marked 
species, collected in 1884 by C. R. Orcutt, on mesas, San Diego, 
California. 

6. C. verna. L. Fl. Suec. ed. 2, 2 (1755.) 

C. vernalis. Koch. Syn. ed. i, 245 (1837) &quot;ot Kiitz. 

Chiefly aquatic, and quite variable. Leaves of two kinds, the 
submerged narrow, linear, one-nerved, retuse or bifid, 10-20 mm. 
long, gradually changing into the emersed, which are three- 
nerved, 8-12 mm. long, the blade 3-4 mm. broad, spatulate or 
obovate, rounded and truncate or retuse at the apex, nar- 
rowing into a margined petiole, and profusely dotted with stellate 
scales. South American forms figured by Hegelm. have rhom- 
boid-spatulate leaves. A terrestrial form, growing in places from 
which the water has receded, much smaller and more compact, 
has tri-nerved, obovate leaves 3-4 mm. long, and 1-2 mm. broad. 
There is also an entirely submerged form with the leaves all 
linear. 

Styles chiefly shorter than the fruit, spreading, deciduous. 
The typical fruit of this species is oblong in shape, i-i^4 &quot;im. 



237 

long and ^-i mm. broad, flat on the face, mostly with a small 
apical notch and narrow apical wings, the grooves between the 
lobes deep. The fruit often varies from oblong to obovate, thus 
approaching the character of the following species. 

To the terrestrial form of this species have been referred C. 
brevifolia, Pursh., and C. terrestris, Raf., and to the submerged 
form C. linearis, Pursh., but no one can tell without an examina- 
tion of their specimens whether these authors had this or the fol- 
lowing species in mind. 

A wide-spread species, but most common in Northern waters. 
It occurs throughout the Dominion of Canada, and in nearly all 
parts of the United States. Found also in South America, 
Europe and Asia. 

7. C.heterophylla. Pursh. Fl. Am. i, 3 (18 14.) 

C. Asagrayi. Hegelm. Monog. p. 54 (1864.) 

Very similar to No. 6 in general appearance, foliage and 
habits ; like that it has^ terrestrial, submerged and intermediate 
forms. Fruit smaller, ^-i mm. long by ^-l&apos;, mm. broad, generally 
obovate, with a deep, broad notch at the apex, thick, almost 
ventricose near the base, lobes obtusely angled, with a small groove 
between them, wingless or with a narrow wing or raised border 
on the upper margin ; stigmas usually longer than the fruit, erect, 
more or less persistent. 

Frequently confounded with C. verna. After examining 
many private collections, and finding fault with the collectors for 
badly mixing up the two species, I was somewhat taken aback, 
as well as much amused, upon re-examining my own specimens 
collected some years since, to find that nearly all which I had 
marked C. verna were C. heterophylla. 

This species is more common than the foregoing in Southern 
waters, but it occurs in Canada, and ranges from New England to 
Florida and Louisiana, and west to Missouri and Colorado. 

8. C. stenocarpa. Hegelm. Verhand. Bot. Brand 10, 114 (1868 ?). 
Floating leaves 10-12 mm. long, obovate, rounded and entire 

at the apex, three-nerved, the blade 8-10 mm. long and about 
4 mm, broad, tapering into a short, margined petiole, marked 
with stellate scales. Submerged leaves linear. Styles erect, 
twice as long as the fruit, deciduous. Fruit flat, with a well 



238 

marked wing on the lobes which runs into the apical notch and 
all around the margins, 15-1; mm. long and i-ijmm. broad. The 
fruit is thinner than in C. verna, and the lobes less divergent, the 
groove about as deep. Collected by Prof. E. L. Greene near 
Donner Lake, Sierra Nevada, California. 

9 C. Bolanderi. Hegelm. Verhand Bot. Brand 10, 114 (1868 ?). 
Usually more branching, with larger stems and leaves than in 
C. verna, but similar to that species in general appearance and 
habit. Floating leaves obovate or rhombic-obovate. Fruit or- 
bicular or slightly obovate, i-t i^ mm. in diameter, or sometimes 
a little longer than broad, the lobes scarcely winged, with sharp 
or obtuse closely approximated margins. Styles twice as long as 
the fruit, erect, persistent or subpersistent. A Pacific coast plant, 
occurring at Vancouver&apos;s Island, and other places in British 
Columbia, Oregon, (Hall No. 460), Washington, Placer County, 
(Bolander) and other places in Cahfornia.

C. angiistifolia. Hoppe. Bot. Tasch. 155 (1792)- 
C. virens. Gold. Act. Mosq. 5, 119 (18 17). 
Plant entirely submerged, very bright green when fresh, often 
growing in rapids. Leaves entirely destitute of stellate scales, 
crowded on the stem, hnear-lanceolate, broader and clasping at 
the base, retuse or bifid at the apex, one- nerved, 10-15 mm. long. 
Styles about as long as the fruit, reflexed and soon deciduous. 
Fruit sessile or occasionally on a minute peduncle, slightly nar- 
rower than long, or orbicular, 1-2 mm. in diameter, the lobes with 
a deep groove between them which extends halfway to the centre 
of the fruit, and broad wings on the margins. 

Extensively diffused in northern regions. Common in Can- 
ada and British Columbia. It occurs in western Massachusetts, 
(Gr. Man. Ed. 6) Lake Champlain (Pringle), Sault Ste. Marie 
(Morong), South Colorado (Brandegee), and Harney Valley, 
Oregon (Howell). 

II. C.peploides. Nutt. Trans. Phil. Soc. n. s. 5, 141 (1837). 
C. Dricmmondi. Hegelm. Monog. 60 (1864). 
A small species, creeping in mats 2-4 cm. upon moist 
ground, often under the shade of dwelling houses. Leaves all 
obovate or oblanccolate, 2-5 mm. long, Yz-lYi mm. broad, the 



239 

blades rounded at the apex and tapering into a short petiole, 
three-nerved. Style as long as or longer than the fruit, erect, 
deciduous or persistent. Fruit very small, sessile or on a minute 
peduncle, entirely unlike that of any other species, being only 
about I mm. long by ^ mm. broad, the lobes separated by a deep 
and broad apical notch, the groove between them small, the 
margins obtuse and wingless, contracting at the base into a 
raised, gibbous projection. The dried plant has a fragrance like 
that of No. I. 

Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas. Also in Cuba (Wright., 
Rugel, No. 234). 
3. Proserpinaca. L. Act. Up. 81 (1741). 

Well-known marsh or aquatic plants readily recognized by 
their three-celled bony triquetrous fruit. It should be noted, 
however, that the flowers are in rare cases four-parted, and when 
this occurs, the fruit is four-gonous, four-celled and four-seeded. 
The inflorescence is in the axils of the emersed leaves. Two 
species only are known, confined to North America. 

Emersed leaves linear or linear-lanceolate, sharply serrate, 
the submerged pectinate or pectinate-pinnatifid. Fruit 
sharply three angled, the faces concave and usually 
smooth. I. P. paliistris. 

Leaves all pinnate or pinnatifid. Fruit smaller, angles 
obtuse, the faces flat or slightly convex, apt to be 
wrinkled or tuberculate. 2. P. pecti7tata. 

1. P.palustris. L. Sp. PI. 88 (1753). 

Trixis palustris. Gaert. De Fruct. ii5,t. 24 (1788). 

The submerged plants of this species may be distinguished 
from those of the following by the fact that the segments are 
commonly denticulate, and bear minute black spines in their 
axils, while this seldom occurs in the other. 

Common in Canada, New England south to Florida, New 
Mexico and Gautemala. west to Minneapolis and Iowa, Cuba 
(Wright).

Ed. 6 182 (1890) not Lam. 
This plant grows about as high as the preceding (20-50 cm.) 



240 

but with a more limited range, occurring in sandy ponds along 
the Atlantic coast from Southern New England to Florida and 
Louisiana. 

In order to compare the number of spinulose teeth in the sub- 
merged leaves of the two species, fourteen of each were taken at 
random and examined. In P. paliistris thirteen plants had them 
on nearly all the leaf segments and one bore them occasionally, 
while in P. pectinata eleven were entirely destitute of them, and 
three showed them occasionally, and these so minute as to be 
scarcely discernible under a lens. 
4. Myriophylbim. L. Gen. PL n. 724 (1737). 

Leaves for the most part verticillate (alternate in No. 4), the 
emersed bract-like, entire, toothed or pectinate, the submerged 
long, pectinate-pinnatifid, with fine capillary divisions. Flowers 
axillary, commonly monoecious, the staminate above with a very 
short calyx tube, and two to four-lobed limb or none. Petals two 
to four. Stamens four to eight. The intermediate flowers not 
unfrequently perfect. Calyx of the fertile flowers with a more or 
less deeply four-grooved tube, and four minute lobes or none. 
Ovary two to four-celled, having a single pendulous ovule in each 
cell. Styles four, short, often plumose and recurved. Drupe 
four-sided, splitting at maturity into four crustaceous, one-seeded, 
indehiscent carpels, which are smooth, angled or tuberculate on 
the back. 

Fifteen or twenty species are known, inhabitants of fresh 
water in all parts of the world, both in the tropics and the frigid 
zone. 

Twelve species occur in North America, which may be briefly 
characterized as follows :

England to Minnesota, Utah and California, south to Florida. 
Common in Europe. 

2. M. alterniflorwn. DC. Fl. Fr. Supp. 529 (1805). Prod.

Stems slender, scape-Hke, nearly leafless, simple, erect, 4 to 
35 cm. high, nearly all out of the water, from a long rhizome, 
which sends up many sterile shoots. Flowers alternate, solitary 
subtended by small, entire bracts, the uppermost obovate and often 
longer than the flowers, the lower oblong and generally shorter 
than the flowers, the lowest part of the spike often bractless. 
Stem with scattered bracts or often naked. Staminate petals four,

5. M. Iiumile. (Raf). 

Piirshia humilis. Raf Med. Rep. 2nd. Hex. 3,422 (1806). 

M. ambigiium var. Hmosum., Nutt. Gen. 2, 212 (1818). Torr. 
Comp. 355 (1826). Gr. Man. Ed. i, 140 (1848). 

This plant occurs in several forms according to the situation in 
which it grows. These forms, when seen only in dried herbari- 
um specimens, might be easily mistaken for distinct species, so 



243 

different are they in general appearance. Each of them has re- 
ceived a varietal name, but they can hardly be considered as any- 
thing more than forms or states, as they readily run into each 
other when the conditions change. 

The type of Rafinesque, commonly called by late authors var. 
liinosiim, is entirely terrestrial, rooting in the mud upon the 
shore, 2 to 4 cm. high, leaves much longer than the fruit, alter- 
nate, linear, and entire or more commonly pectinate, sometimes 
pinnatifid. Fruit minute, slightly more than i mm. long and i 
mm. or less in breadth. Carpels usually smooth, sometimes a 
little rough, the groove small. Petals four, purplish. Stamens 
four. This form appears to be the offspring of the floating plant 
which often roots in the mud where it is cast ashore, and sends 
up an erect flowering stem, frequently leaving traces of the old 
submerged leaves below the rooting node. 

The form called M. ainbignum var. natans by Dr. Gray (Man. 
Ed. I, p. 140) and which he seems to have considered the type, is 
intermediate between the type and the so-called var. capillaceiim. 
It usually occurs in still, shallow water, with a spike of flowers 
and the typical floral leaves above the surface, and subverticillate 
or, more commonly, scattered pinnatifid leaves beneath ; the divi- 
sions are few. On specimens of this from the herbarium of Mr. 
Oakes, marked by him M. capillaceum, Nutt., I find spikes nearly 
30 cm. long. When botanizing on Nantucket in the summer of 
1887, I found these aquatic forms together in some of the small 
ponds, growing in such profusion that they were literally in heaps. 
A note sent to Mrs. Owen, and published on page 26 of her in- 
teresting catalogue of the plants of the island, will show how inti- 
mately associated they are. 

&quot; In both these ponds the plant is at first var. capillacetim 
while immersed, but very soon it gets its head above water and 
immediately forms pectinate leaves — that is becomes the type as 
described in Gray&apos;s Manual. I have plenty of specimens in both 
conditions Avhich grew together.&quot; 

The form called M. ambigiaimhy Nutt. (Gen. 2, 213) and M. 
ambigjimn, var. capillaceum by Torr.&amp;Gray (Fl. N. A. i, 543) and 
other authors, is commonly a deep water plant, entirely submerged. 
Stems long, widely branching, very plumose when growing, leaves 



244 

all pinnatifid with hair-like divisions, subverticillate or scattered. 
It rarely flowers or fruits, and when it does the inflorescence may 
be seen scattered here and there in the axils of the leaves. One 
or more of the forms occur from eastern Massachusetts to Mary- 
land and Tennessee, and west to Illinois and Indiana. 

6. M. proserpinacoides. Gill, in Hook. Bot. Misc. 3, 313 (1833). 

This is a South American species introduced from Chili or 
Buenos Aires, where it is a native. It has partially naturalized 
itself in Hopkins&apos; pond, near Haddonfield, and other places in 
New Jersey, and seems to be spreading. All the plants occurring 
in our waters appear to have sprung from stock imported several 
years ago by the florist, Mr. E. D. Sturtevant, of Bordentown, 
New Jersey, who writes that &quot; it is entirely hardy here, below 
the reach of ice or frost.&quot; 

Hooker describes it as monoecious and dioecious. I have 
seen only pistillate plants. These are very vigorous, 10 to 40 
cm. high, even lifting themselves out of the water and growing 
quite as well above as below it. Normally, however, it seems to 
be a submerged plant. Leaves all alike, smooth, glaucous, pectin- 
ate-pinnatifid, in crowded verticils of fives, 15 to 20 mm. long, 
pinnae linear, twenty to twenty-five in number, the pairs opposite 
or subopposite, each segment about 5 mm. long, and sharply 
pointed. Stamens said by Gillies to be eight. Pistillate flowers 
axillary, about i mm. high, without petals, with four white plu- 
mose stigmas. Fruit not seen, but as indicated by the ovaries, 
the carpels should be smooth. Between the bases of the leaves 
and among the flowers are many small white trichomes, or hair- 
like bracts. 

7. M. heterophyllum. Michx. Fl. 2, 191 (1803). 

Potamogeton verticillatum. Walt. Fl. Car. 90 (1788). 

Floral leaves in whorls of threes and fives, linear, ovate or 
lanceolate, serrate or rarely entire, much longer than the flowers, 
sometimes as much as 18 mm. in length and 4 mm. broad ; sub- 
merged leaves verticillate or subverticillate, crowded, about 2 cm. 
long, with six to ten pairs of capillary pinnae. The flowering 
spike occasionally attains the length of 40 or 50 cm. Petals 
somewhat persistent. Stamens four, very rarely six. Fruit 2 



245 

mm. long and i ^ to i^ mm. wide. Carpels two-keeled and 
usually a little scabrate on the back. 

Ontario, New York, south to Florida, New Mexico and Mex- 
ico, west to Ohio and Minnesota. 

8. M. hippiiroides. Nutt. in Torrey and Gray Fl. i, 530(1840). 

M. scabratiivt. Cham. Linnaea 4, 506, not Michaux. 

Leaves in whorls of fours and sixes, sometimes scattered, the 
floral 8 to 12 mm. long, linear-lanceolate, serrate or dentate, up- 
permost nearly or quite entire, lowest pinnatifid ; submerged, with 
six to eight pairs of capillary pinnae. Monoecious, but occasion- 
ally with only one kind of flowers on the stems, and so appearing 
dioecious. Petals often pink-colored, sub-persistent. Stamens 
four. Fruit about 2 mm. long by i mm. or a little more in 
breadth ; carpels keeled and somewhat rough, with a deep groove

New or Noteworthy North American Phanerogams.— IV. 

By N. L. Britton. 

Ranuncultis pedatifidiis. Smith in Rees. Cyclop. No. 72 (18 19). 
R. affinis, R. Br. in Bot. App. Parry&apos;s First Voyage, 
265 (1823). 

Smith gives a very good account of the plant, saying that 
there are four specimens of it in the Linnaean Herbarium, and that 
it is a native of Siberia. It is now known to inhabit both north- 
ern Asia and North America The specimens are still in the 
Linnaean Herbarium. 

Var. CARDIOPHYLLUS (Hook.), (/v. cardiophyllus, Hook, Fl. 
Bor. Am. i. 14 (1830) ; R. affinis, var. cardiophylIiis,A. Gray, Proc. 
Acad. Phil 1863, 56), the state of the species with entire or nearly 
entire radical leaves, appears to bear a similar relation to it as R. 
inicranthiis, Nutt. does to R. abortivus, L. 

Ranunculus Grayi.

Schlechtendahl&apos;s R. Hookcri is a Mexican species. 

ISOPYRUM, L. Gen. PL Ed. 2, 245 (1742). 

Coptis, Salisb. Trans. Linn. Soc. viii. 305 (1803). 

Isopyriun and Coptis have been kept separate by recent au- 
thors, the character depended upon for their distinction being the 
sessile follicles of the one and the stipitate follicles of the other. 
Baillon (Hist. PI. i.) has referred Coptis to Hcllcborus, L. under 
which genus the typical species H. trifolius, L. was first described, 
and except for the vegetative characters it is certainly closely re- 
lated to this genus. But taking all the known species together 
it seems to me more desirable to unite Coptis with Isopyrnm. 
Isopyruni s-tipitatum, A. Gray, of the Northwest contains in itself 
the characters of the two genera. Our Eastern species Hcllebonts 
trifolius, L., will then become I. TRIFOLIUM (L). 

Neckeria, Scop. Introd. Hist. Nat. 313 (1777). 

Corydalis, Vent. Choix. PL Cels t. 19 (1803). 
This, as pointed out by Pfeffer, (Bot. Zeit. xv. 643), is the first 



266 

post-Linnaean name applicable to these plants, Linnaeus hav- 
ing regarded them as species of Fiimaria. The pre-Linnsean 
name was Capnoidcs, but this was taken up by Rupp, (Flora Jen. 
Ed. 2,268 (1745) ), for the South African plant subsequently de- 
scribed by Linnaeus as Fuuiaria vesicaria and on which the genus 
Cysticapuos of Gaertner is based. 

If we are to follow the opinion of Bentham and Hooker, as ex- 
pressed in Gen. PI. i. 56, that the South African species is con- 
generic with those of the northern hemisphere, then Capnoides, 
Rupp., should be applied to them all ; but this plant appears to 
me to have sufficient characters to rank as a valid genus. I am quite 
aware that the adjective termination aides for genera, has been 
objected to by many authors, but it is in frequent use in zoology, 
and was freely used by pre-Linnaean botanists {Cyperoidcs, Tourn. 
=^Carex, L., for example), and is no more adjective than Gloriosa 
L., or Iinpatieiis, L., which are in common use. Scopoli&apos;s name 
Neckcria will prevent Neckera, Hedw. Fund. Hist. Muse. ii. 93 
(1782), being used for the genus of Mosses, which has, however, 
received the name Paraphysanthiis, Spruce, while Neckcria, 
Gmel. Syst. ii. 16 (179 1) is the same as Pollichia. 

Neckcria has been adopted for Corydalis by Mr. N. E. Brown 
of Kew, in his forthcoming supplement to the English Botany, 
and to him I am indebted for the reference to Rupp&apos;s work.

Eucapnos, Bernh. loc. cit. (1833). 
The adoption of Adanson&apos;s name for the plants which have 
recently been generally known as Dicentras, will happily solve 
the question as to the misspelling of Borckhausen&apos;s Diclytra. 
There can be no doubt of what Adanson meant, his description 
being clear, and his reference to Plukenet&apos;s Plate 90, fig. 3, being 
consulted shows this to be a pretty good representation of our Di- 
ccntra Canadensis. Adanson&apos;s name is based on Bicuculata, March.

Nasturtium hispidnm (Desv.) DC. Syst. ii. 20i (1821). 

Brae hylobus hispidiis, Dqsv. ]onrn. Bot. iii. 183 (18 14). 
Nastiirthnn palustrc, var. Jiispidiim, A. Gray, Man. Ed. 5 
(1867.) 

I am satisfied that this is a distinct species from the European 
N. palustrc, and in this conclusion I am strengthened by the 
opinions of such close observers as Mr. Bicknell and Professor 
Macoun. The plant is apparently strictly East American in 
distribution, and is one of the commonest Crucifers in our territory. 
N. palustrc is rarely met with and occurs only in situations where 
it has been introduced. It can readily be distinguished from N. 
hispidnm by its linear pods which are 4-6 times as long as thick, 
and by the nearly entire absence of pubescence on the stem and 
branches, N. hispiduui having globose-ovoid pods, and usually 
considerable hirsute pubescence. 

The status of the Northwestern and Rocky Mountain plant 
which has also been referred to ^V. palustrc is more uncertain. 
It is commonly larger than European palustrc, has, I believe, 
larger flowers and still longer pods. Professor Macoun is inclined 
to consider it a distinct species, but the specimens at my com- 
mand do not convince me of the correctness of this view. It is 
certainly closer to palustrc than hispidum is, and shares the pecu- 
larity of many Rocky Mountain species in more nearly resembling 
European plants than do those of the eastern half of the conti- 
nent. 

Arabis lyrata, L. Sp. PI. 685 (1753). 

Cardaminc spathulata, Michx. Fl. Bor. Am. ii. 29 (1803). 

Under these circumstances it will no longer seem strange that 
Michaux&apos;s species which came from the Southern Alleghenies, 
and of which the type is preserved at Paris, has never since been 
found. 

CORONOPUS, Hall. Helv. i. 217 (1768), fide Baillon, Hist.

Sencbiera, D.C. Mem. Soc. Hist. Nat. Paris, vii. 140, t. 89 
(1799). 

The earliest specific names of the two species occurring in 
North America may be indicated as follows : 

I. Corojiopus didynius, (L.), Smith, Fl. Brit. iii. 691 (1800). 



268 

Lcpidiuiii didyiniiiii, L. Mant ; 92 (1767). Lcpidiwn Aiigliaun, 
Huds., Fl. Angl. Ed. 2. 280 (1778). Scnebiera didyina, Pers. 
Syn. ii. 185 (1807). 

2. CORONOPUS CORONOPUS, (L). CocJilcaria Coronopns, L. 
Sp., PI. 648 (1753). Nasturtium vcrrncariuiii, Gars. Fig. PI. t. 
402 (1767), fide DC. Scnebiera Corouopus, Poir. in Lam. 
Encycl. vii. ^6 (1806). 

Linnaeus employed the generic name in the first edition of 
his Systema, (1835), but that is a mere Hst of genera. 

POMBALIA, VandelH Fasc. PI. 7 (1771). 

This long antedates lonidium as a generic name, for the latter 
was not published until 1803 (Vent. Hort. Malm. 27, t. 27). 

l^ombalia is based on the South American plant commonly 
known as lonidiuui IpccacnanhcE which Vandelli described as 
Poinbalia IpccacuanJicB, giving a very good figure of it. There 
seems no good reason, then, for not using the older name. 
As to related genera, Solea, Spreng, as also older than lonidium, 
dating from 1800, and was thought by Dr. Gray to be distinct, 
although united with lonidium by Bentham and Hooker. Hy- 
bantJius, Jacq. Enum. Carib. 2 (1760) is the oldest named of the 
group, based upon the spiny plants of the West Indies, and 
Baillon unites them all under this name. But if we follow Dr. 
Gray in keeping up Hybant/ius, (Bot. Gaz. xi. 293), then the 
next oldest name is Pombalia. 

Silene Caroliniana, Walt. Fl. Car. 142 (1788). 

Silene Pennsylvanica, Michx. Fl. Bor. Am. i. 272 (1803). 
There is a specinen of this plant in Walter&apos;s Herbarium, 
marked &quot; Silene an Virginica,&quot; evidently a type of his description, 
which fits it exactly. In the Linnaean Herbarium there is also a 
specimen of it marked Virginica, by Linnaeus, but pinned fast 
to the sheet is another bearing a good specimen marked only 
&apos;• K,&quot; indicating that it was received from Kalm, of the 5. Vir- 
ginica of the description in Species Plantarum, 419. Linnaeus 
evidently did not distinguish the two species. 
Cerastium erectum (L).

This species, which was included in the earlier editions of 
Gray&apos;s Manual, but omitted in the 6th edition, is represented in 
the Kew Herbarium by abundant specimens collected by Drum- 
mond years ago at Philadelphia, and in the Torrey Herbarium 
by specimens from Baltimore. It does not appear to have been 
recently found in the United States. 

RJius typJiina, L. Amoen. Acad. iv. 311 (1760). 
Datisca hirta, L. Sp. PI. 1037 (1753). 

The type of Datisca Jiirta preserved in the Linnsean Herba- 
rium is a specimen of the Stag-horn Sumach in the condition of 
the inflorescence reverting to leaves, a phenomenon which fre- 
quently occurs in this and related species. Linnaeus had the 
plant from Kalm, and it was collected at Philadelphia. Although 
hirta is thus the oldest specific name associated with the plant, 
we are, I think, debarred from using it by the publication of 
RJuis hirta, Harv., as a synonym by Engler in DC. Monog. 
Phan. iv. 425 (1883), where this is referred to R. tridcntata, 
Sond. 

Kraunhia, Raf. Med. Rep. (H) v. 352 (1808) ; Steud. Nom. 
Ed. 2, i. 850. 

Diplonyx, Raf Fl. Ludov. loi (18 17). 
TJiyrsanthus, Ell. Journ. Acad. Phila. i. 371 (18 17). 
Wisteria, Nutt. Gen. ii. 115 (18 18). 
RafineSque cites Glycine frutescens, L., as an equivalent for 
his proposed genus KraiinJiia, so there is no question of the plant 
intended. 

Cruminium, Desv. Ann. Sci. Nat. (I) ix. 423 (1826). 
Centroseuia, Benth. Ann. Mus. Wien. ii. 117 (1840). 
Clitoria § Centroseuia, DC. Prodr. ii. 234 (1825). 
The genus is founded on the plant commonly known as Cen- 
troseuia Pluuiieri, Benth. {Ci uuiininui giganteuui, Desv.). 
The North American species is Cruminium Virginianum (L). 
Clitoria Virginiana, L. Sp. PI. 753 (1753). Centroseuia Vir- 
giniana, Benth. Ann. Mus. Wein. ii. 120 (1840). 

Gleditsehia aqnatica^ Marsh Arb. Amer. 54 (1785). 
This, I believe, is the oldest available name for the Water 
Locust of the Southern States. To be sure, as pointed out by 



270 

Prof. Greene, (BULLETIN, xvii. 14), it was called G. inerinis by 
Crantz, (Inst. Rei. Herb. i. 219 (1766), and this name was sub- 
sequently used for the tree by Miller and K. Koch ; but Linnaeus 
published a G. incnnis in Syst. Nat. Ed. 10 (1759), as cited in 
Richter&apos;s Codex, p. 1012, and repeated it in Sp. PI. Ed. 2, 1059 
(1763). Although this G. ///^/v/z/jr of Linnaeus was, apparently, 
a composite species made up of one from Java ancj the North 
American G. triacantJios, the reference to the Javanese tree 
by him stands first, and the species is said to come from Java. 
Hence we are not justified in using the same binomial published 
seven years later for a different plant. 

Spir^a rubra. (Hill). 

Ubnaria rubra, Hill, Hort. Kew 214, t. 7 (1769). 
Spinea lobata, Gronov. in Jacq. Hort. Vind. i. 38, t. 88, 
(1770). 

Hill&apos;s figure and description clearly indicate that he had this 
plant in mind rather than Gilkiiia stipulata (Muhl.) Max. Act. 
Hort. Petr. vi. 228 {G. stipnlacca, Nutt), as has been suggested. 

Gaini Canadcns.c, Jacq. Hort. Vind. ii. 82, t. 175 (1772). 
G. Caroliniaiiuiii, Walt. Fl. Car. 150 (1788). 
G. (xlbnm, Gmel. Syst. ii. 861 (1791). 

Jacquin&apos;s plate leaves no doubt as to what he intended. There 
is a fragment of G. Caroliuiannni, Walt, in Walter&apos;s Herbarium 
at the British Museum, which is apparently the same. G. Can- 
adcnsc, Murray, Comm. Soc. Goett. v. 33, t. 4, f B. (1775J, is 
from figure and description clearly G. strict/an, Ait. Hort. Kew. 
ii. 217 (1789), of which there is a type preserved in the general 
herbarium at the British Museum.

Saxifraga Gcnin,\.. Sp. PI. i. 40 1 (1753)- 

There is a specimen of this species in Durand&apos;s Herbarium at 
Paris, collected by the Rev. Mr. Steinhaur, in Newfoundland. 
It is erroneously labeled by Durand S. spicata, Don. This ap- 
pears to be the first indication of its occurrence in America.

271 

I believe that this southern plant is specifically dififerent from 
P. Caroliniana, Michx. As pointed out by Hooker, the stam- 
inodia are very slender and exceed the anther-bearing stamens; 
the flowers and leaves are usually larger ; Hooker further remarks 
that these characters are retained in cultivation. I have never seen 
elongated staminodia in our common northern plant, and am very 
familiar with it in the wild state. The identity of DeCandolle&apos;s 
and Hooker&apos;s plants appears to be satisfactorily established. 
We have it from North Carolina, (Rugel, Dr. Gray) Florida, 
(Chapman). DeCandolle&apos;s plant came from the Cherokee country, 
and Hooker&apos;s from Louisiana. There may be some doubt as 
to whether this, or what we are calling Caroliitiana, is really the 
plant of Michaux, because the specimen of it is missing in his 
herbarium at Paris. 

Ammannia Koehnei, n. sp. Aiiniiaiiia hunt His, fi. T.&amp;G. 
Fl. N. A. i. 480 (1840). 

Erect, glabrous, 6&apos;-2o&apos; high, at length freely branching. 
Leaves obovate, oblonceolate, or somewhat spatulate, obtuse or 
obtusish at the apex, the upper ones clasping and more or less 
auriculate at the base, the lower narrowed and sessile, or taper- 
ing into a short petiole ; flowers 1-3 together in the axils, sessile; 
petals purple ? fugacious ; stamens very short, not exserted ; 
style very short ; capsule enclosed by the calyx. 

In swamps, Hackensack marshes, New Jersey (Torrey ; 
Leggett) to Florida. Named in honor of the distinguished 
monographer of the Lythrariese, Dr: E. Koehne, of Berlin. The 
species cannot be referred to A. latifolia, L,, which has auricu- 
late, linear-lanceolate leaves and no petals. 

Epilobiuiii liucarc, Muhl. Cat. 39 (18 13). 

My remarks on this species in reviewing Professor Trelease&apos;s 
recent Revision of the North American Epilobia (BULLETIN, 
this volume, p. 226), where I suggested that the name E. oligaii- 
tJuiin, Michx. (1803) should have been taken for it, are quite 
wide of the mark, for the original in Michaux&apos;s Herbarium is E. 
palnstrc, L., as determined there by Haussknecht. 

Epilobiiiin glaudiilosuiii, Lehm. 

Professor Trelease included this species in his treatment of 
the East American members of the genus in the sixth edition of 
Gray&apos;s Manual, but in his Revision, published subsequently, he 



272 

excludes it from the range of that work, and cites its distribution 
as only westward. Haussknect evidently based his statement 
that it occurred eastward on a specimen in Michaux&apos;s Herba- 
rium, from Tadousac, Canada, which is so labelled by him. 

Tillcea aqnatica, L. Sp. PI. 128 (1753). 

T. simplex, Nutt. Journ. Acad. Phil. i. 114 (1817). 
Bnlliardia aqnatica, D.C. Prodr. iii. 382 (1828). 

I have carefully compared authentic specimens of the East 
American plant with the Linnasan species at London and Paris, 
and am convinced that the suggestion made in Torrey and Gray&apos;s 
Flora N. A. that they are identical is the actual fact. M. 
Franchet kindly compared them with me at Paris, and had no 
hesitation in pronouncing them identical. He also informed me 
that the European plant occurs on mud, as does the American. 

Vleckia, Raf. Med. Rep. (H) v. 352 (1808). 

LopJiantJius, Benth. Bot. Reg. xv. under t. 1282 (1829), 
not Adanson, nor Forster. 

Rafinesque gives Hyssopus ncpetioidcs as the equivalent of 
Vleckia ncpctoides, which plant was long subsequently referred 
by Bentham to Loplianthns. But in addition to the fact that a 
eenus for these plants had been thus established, the name Lo- 
phantJuis had been used by Adanson in Fam. PI. ii. 194 (1763) 
for a species of Ncpcta, and by Forster (Char. Gen. PL Insul. 
Maris Austral. 27, t. 14 (1776), for plants now referred to Wal- 
thcria. Hence LophantJuis is, from my point of view, doubly 
inapplicable to the genus of Labiatae. 

Rafinesque has named all the American species under his 
genus in New Flora N. A. and Fl. Telluriana. 

UVULARIA, L. Gen. PI. Ed. i. p. 93, No. 263 (i737)- 

Oakesia, S. Wats. Proc. Amer. Acad. xiv. 221 (1879). 

The characters assigned to the genus proposed by Dr. Wat- 
son appear to me to be insufficient to separate it from Uvnlaria. 
They are all differences of degree rather than kind, and a care- 
ful study of all the known species in the field has afforded me 
no other points of difference on which a genus could be main- 
tained. But whether they be considered as congeneric or dis- 
tinct, the name applied by him is not available for these plants, 
because it was previously given by Tuckerman to Conuia Con- 
radii, Torr. (Hook. London Journ. Bot. i. 445 (1842).

Notes on the North American Species 

of Eriocauleae. 



BY THOS. MORONG. 



(Reprinted from Bulletin ok the Tokbey Botanical Club, Vol. XVIII, No. 12, Dec. 1891.) 



Notes on the North American Species of Eriocauleee, 

By Thomas Morong. 

This order is sparsely represented in North America, consist- 
ing in fact only of a few outlying members of a tropical family. 
A single species only is found as far north as Canada, the greater 
number occurring in the warm sections of the United States. 
The genus Lachnocaiilon, however, is endemic in our country, 
and therefore has a special interest for us. The great bulk of the 
family is confined to South America, where three-quarters of the 
three hundred and twenty-five species embraced in it occur. Our 
own species have been imperfectly investigated and poorly de- 
fined, and for this reason the present paper has been prepared in 
the hope that something may be contributed towards a better 
understanding of their characters and geographical distribution. 

In general aspect these plants may be easily recognized, being 
very peculiar. The flowers are androgynous or dioecious and 
contained in more or less hemispherical heads which are enclosed 
by involucral scales as in the Compositae. In the place of 
growth they favor swampy grounds or shallow water, but a 
few grow in low sandy barrens or fields. In mode of growth 
the; are caespitose, and new tufts of leaves are added year 
by ^ar to the stock so that in time quite a little colony is col- 
lectt about the same caudex, from which scapes, sometimes 
very numerous, are annually sent up. The scapes are nearly 
always twisted in the growth, and always marked longitudinally 
by angles, which are frequently interrupted by intermediate 
ridges or stri^. As these intermediate ridges are often partial, 
the number of angles assigned to a scape will vary with the point 



352 

at which the number is reckoned. This will account for the dis- 
crepancy which occurs in the statements of different observers. The 
large roots are spongy or often conspicuously nodose for their 
whole length. With three of the genera we have no concern, as 
two of them, PJiilodice and Toiiina, both together numbering five 
species, are restricted to tropical South America, and the other, 
Mcsanthemum, numbering three species, is endemic in tropical 
Africa. 

The North American genera may be briefly distinguished as 
follows : 

Segments of the perianth four or six. 
Stamens separate. Anthers two-celled. Stamens as many as 

the perianth segments. i. Eriocaitlon. 

Stamens one-half as many as the perianth segments. 

2. Diipatya. 
Perianth of three segments. Stamens three, monadelphous below. 

Anthers one- celled. 3. LacJinocaulon. 

Eriocaitlon is the most extensively diffused genus, being found 
in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. As 
classified by Kornicke in his monograph the species are divided 
into fourteen sections. All the species occurring within the bor- 
ders of the United States, so far as known, are acaulescent or 
nearly so, the heads single on erect peduncles or scapes, the peri- 
anth with one exception four-parted and the stamens four ; ihe 
Mexican species are the same except in having six-parted flowers 
and six stamens. The perianth segments, at least the upper ones, 
are usually spotted with a minute black gland near the centre or 
the apex. The heads are generally quite villose and grayish in 
appearance, the parts of the perianth being strongly bearded. The 
flowers are each subtended by a bract quite similar in markings 
and general appearance to the perianth segments. Seeds oval, 
brown when mature and, under the lens, covered with blunt or 
spiny protuberances. 

As the perianth segments are in two series and often separated 
at a considerable distance, there is much variation in the language 
applied to them by botanists. Kornicke calls the floral envelopes 
a double perigonium, the exterior calyculate and interior sub- 
coroUine. Kunth speaks of them as a double calyx, while others 



353 

still regard them as calyx and corolla. The segments of the two 
series are alternate with each other, sometimes one or both pedi- 
cellate or tubular below, sometimes free and separate, often par- 
tially or wholly connate. 

The floral appendages of these plants constitute a morphologi- 
cal feature of great interest. In Eriocaulon the appendage of the 
staminate flower appears like a style included in and coalescent 
with the tube of the inner segments, projecting between the 
bases of the stamens in three small black points which look much 
like the segmental glands. I do not find this in the pistillate 
flower. In Diipatya and Lachnocaulon the appendages are more 
marked. In the staminate flower they stand up in two or three 
distinct lobes which are often papillose. In the pistillate flower 
they are attached to the style in or below the sinuses of the 
stigmas, apparently enclosing and cohering with the style. Nearly 
all the botanists who have noticed these appendages regard those 
of the staminate flowers as rudimentary pistils. Kunth consid- 
ers them so in both kinds of flowers, but most botanists are con- 
tent to call those of the fertile flowers merely appendages. 

Of the following species seven occur in the United States and 
five in Mexico, of which two are more particularly described as 
they approach our boundary near enough to render it probable 
that sooner or later they will be detected on this side of the bor- 
der. 

I. Eriocaulon articulatum (Huds.). 

NasmytJiia articulata, Huds. Fl. Ang. Ed. 2, 1,415 (1778). 

E. pelliicidiun, Mx. Fl. ii, 166 (1803). 

E. septangiilare, With. Ar. Br. PI. ii. 257. (1818); Torr. 
Bot. N. Y. ii. 335 (1843), and other American authors. 

Stem a mere crown. Leaves pellucid, three to eight nerved, 
fenestrate, acuminate, ^ to 3 inches long, usually equal to the 
sheaths. Scapes weak, commonly twisted, about seven-angled, 
smooth, mostly from 4 to 8 inches in height, but sometimes 
scarely one inch, and when submersed often elongating till they 
are from 4 to 10 feet long, usually solitary but occasionally 
clustered, Involucral scales smooth or the innermost bearded at 
the apex, oblong, obtuse, entire, scarious, of a livid or fuscous 
tint, usually shorter than the flowers. Heads androgynous, the 



354 

marginal flowers usually staminate. Bracts cuneate or obovate, 
abruptly pointed, fuscous above and white bearded, receptacle 
smooth, flowers about i y^ lines high, the outer sterile perianth 
tubular below and its lobes at some distance from the inner, all 
bearded at the apex. The gland is borne sometimes on the 
bract and both pairs of segments, and sometimes only on the 
upper pair. One of the upper pair is generally larger than the 
other. Fertile flowers scarcely more than half the size of the 
sterile, the pairs of perianth segments without a tube, and much 
nearer together than the sterile, all densely bearded. 

Still, shallow water, ponds and streams, Newfoundland to 
Ontario, New England and Minnesota, south to Florida and Texas. 
Occurs in Great Britain. July to October. 

2. Eriocaulon compressum, Lam. 
E.compressiim, Lam. Encyc. Hi. 276 (1789); Kornicke, Linnaea, 

xxvii. 592 (1854). 

E. gnaphalodcs, Mx. Fl. ii. 165 (1803), and American authors 
generally. 

Leaves coarsely or finely six to twenty fenestrate-nerved, 
usually shorter than the sheaths, tapering to a long, sharp point, 
rigid, or when submerged thin and pellucid, scapes 6 to 35 inches 
high, smooth, more or less compressed when dry, ten to twelve 
angled. Involucral scales rounded, obtuse, scarious, shining, 
smooth, imbricated in three or four rows, heads frequently dioe- 
cious, 3 to 6 lines in diameter. Receptacle smooth. Flowers i y^, 
to 2 lines high. In other respects like the preceding species. 

In anthesis the styles and stigmas are much exserted, stand- 
ing above the heads like projecting threads. The sheaths are 
obliquely fissured, obtuse at the point, veined like the leaves. 

In still, shallow water, ponds and streams. New Jersey to 
Texas. Cuba. May to October. 

3. Eriocaulon decangulare, L. 

E. decangulare, L. Sp. PI. &quot;^J (1753). 

Caudex short and thick, from one to two inches long. 
Leaves finely many-nerved, or often apparently nerveless, 
ensiform, tapering to a blunt point, usually much longer than the 
sheaths, 6 to 20 inches long and 2 I0 8 lines broad. Scapes 



355 

stout, rigid, smooth, ten to fourteen-angled, i to 3 feet high. 
Heads 4 to 8 lines in diameter. Involucral scales ovate, often 
eroded, dentate at the apex and hairy below. Receptacle hairy, 
the hairs under the microscope many-celled, appearing acute at 
the apex or very rarely club-shaped. Flowers about 2 lines 
high, densely woolly at the base, the bract larger than the 
flowers acute, white-bearded. Perianth segments spatulate, 
white-bearded. 

Swamps, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to Florida and Texas. 
Cuba. June to October. 

4. ERIOCAULON Ravenelii, Chapm. 

E. Ravenelii, Chapm. Fl. 503 (i860). 

Very smooth throughout. Leaves linear, very acute, flat, 
thick or thin and pellucid, finely five to ten-nerved, somewhat 
longer than the sheaths. Scapes slender, 4 to 5 inches high, 
clustered, five to six-sulcate. Sheaths obliquely fissured, acute, 
nerved like the leaves. Heads i to 2 lines in diameter. 
Involucral scales scarious, light straw-colored, oblong, very ob- 
tuse. Bracts a little narrower than the scales, often obtusely 
pointed and denticulate, fuliginous. Flowers scarcely more 
than i^ line high, fuscous, smooth. Segments of the outer fer- 
tile perianth separate, very slender, mucronately pointed ; of 
the inner somewhat broader, minutely toothed. Ovary sessile ; 
style parted into two stigmas. Chapman states that the style is 
occasionally simple and the seeds minutely pubescent. The spec- 
imens which I have examined failed to show either.

5. ERIOCAULON Texense, Korn. . 

E. Texense, Korn. Linnsea, xxvii. 595 (1854). 

Scapes smooth, 8 to 10 inches high, six to seven-sulcate, slender, 
in the specimens examined solitary. Leaves acuminate, many- 
nerved, fenestrate, flat, smooth, i to 2 inches long, a little shorter 
than the sheaths. Roots fibrous, the larger ones nodose. Heads 
hemispherical, i to 2 lines in diameter. Livolucral scales 
obovate or nearly orbicular, smooth, entire, straw-colored. Re- 
ceptacle pilose with silky hairs. Bracts as long as the flowers, 
cuneate or obovate, the upper part livid, the lower whitish. 



356 

rounded&apos;or more commonly pointed at the apex, hairy on the 
back and fimbriate at the apex with a coarse white beard. Flow- 
ers about I line long. Outer perianth segments in the staminate 
flower free, abruptly acute, slightly longer and larger than the 
inner, spatulate, fuscous above and bearded. Pistillate flowers 
bearded similarly to the staminate, the lobes occasionally three ; 
ovary shortly stipitate, dicoccous ; stigmas two. The heads 
appear densely villous. This species is easily distinguished from 
E. artiailatiim and E. conipressum by its villose receptacle, and 
from E. dccangnlare by its smaller stature, its more slender scape, 
shorter and acute bracts, smaller heads and flowers.

E. Kdrnickianiim, Van Heurck et Miill. Arg. Obs. PI. Nov. 

Herb. Van Heurck, 10 1 (1870). 
I have not seen a specimen of this Texan plant, but the 
authors of the species describe it as having pellucid leaves which 
are five to seven-nerved, plane, smooth, 8 to 1 1 lines long and 
a little over i line wide at the base. Scapes numerous, 4 to 5 
inches high, setaceous, smooth, compressed, two to three-angled, 
with lax sheaths which are as long as the leaves. Heads ovoid- 
globose, about i^ inch long, a little longer than broad. Involu- 
cral scales fuliginous, broadly obovate, irregularly denticulate and 
white-woolly above, at length slightly recurved. Receptacle 
smooth. Bracts not quite i line high, surpassing the flowers. 
Sterile flowers about y^ line high ; outer perianth segments 
smooth and black-glandular at the apex ; inner obovate and pilose 
at the apex. Stamens four. Inner perianth segments of the fertile 
flower white- woolly on the margins. Style two-parted, plainly 
destitute of appendages. Seeds ellipsoidal, rough papillose.

7. Eriocaulon MicRocErHALUM, H. B. K. 
E. viicrocephalnm, H. B. K. Nov. Gen. i. 253 (18 15); Kunth 

Enum. 3, 548 (1841). 
Small caespitose plants. Leaves 4 to 8 lines long, acute, 
five to eight fenestrate-nerved, smooth above, often woolly at 



357 

the base; Scapes clustered, numerous, 4 to 6 lines high, 
smooth, four-angled, the angles often separated by finer inter- 
mediate stris. Sheaths shorter than the leaves, rather obtuse at 
the point. Heads globular, about i line in diameter. Involu- 
cral scales broadly obovate, entire or denticulate, very light 
straw-colored, smooth or sometimes scantily fimbriate at the 
apex. Receptacle smooth. Bracts obovate, acute or obtuse, 
longer than the flowers, bearded at the apex. Flowers trimerous. 
a little more than i line high. Staminate flow^ers pedicellate ; 
exterior perianth segments sometimes two only, obtuse, the pos- 
terior ones connate in a keeled hood and white pilose at the top ; 
interior segments white, tubular below, three-lobed above, the 
lobes fimbriate, rounded, denticulate or entire at the apex. Sta- 
mens six. Fertile flowers sessile, exterior perianth segments 
often two only ; fuscous above and pilose, the interior more deli- 
cate and longer, white, spatulate, obtuse, pilose internally and on 
the margin. Ovary sessile, three-celled. Style three-parted; 
stigmas three. 

This species has found its way from Jalisco, Mexico, where 
it is common, to Fort Tejon, California, at which place it was 
collected by Xantus in the expedition of 1857-8, although it is 
not enumerated in Dr. Gray&apos;s list of Xantus&apos; plants. I find spec- 
imens of it without a name in the Torrey Herbarium. 
8. Eriocaulon Benthami, Kunth. 

E. Benthami, Kunth. Enum. 3, 545 (1841), originally pub- 
lished by Bentham in his PI. Hart., p. 28, as &quot; Eriocauli, 
sp. nov ? &quot; 

Leaves i to 3 inches long, smooth, about the same length as 
the sheaths or longer ; eight to twelve-nerved, obtuse and cal- 
lous at the apex. Scapes 4 to 15 inches high, smooth, six or 
seven-sulcate. Roots thick, nodose. Heads very white-woolly, 
globose, 2 to 3 lines in diameter. Involucral scales smooth, 
obtuse, somewhat longer than the bracts, straw-colored. Recep- 
tacle pilose. Bracts spatulate, fuscous, abruptly acute, woolly on 
the back and coarsely white-bearded on the apical margins. 
Flowers i ^ line high ; perianth six-parted, the three exterior 
segments free, white below, fuscous above and bearded at the 
apex. In the staminate flower the interior perianth is stipitate 



358 

and the two anterior segments are connected with the posterior 
one ; in the pistillate flower they are free. All the segments are 
bearded at the apex. Stamens six. Ovary stipitate, three- 
celled ; style three-parted. The species is well distinguished from 
E. dccangiilarc, to which it is similar in habit, by its six-parted 
flowers. Hartweg collected this plant at Lagos, Mexico.

9. ERIOCAULON Pringlei, S. Wats. 
E. Pringlei, S. Watson, Proc. Am. Ac. xxiii. 283 (1888). 

A delicate plant with slender five to six-sulcate scapes ^ to 
5 inches high, all the parts very smooth. Leaves acuminate, flat, 
about three- nerved, as long as or a little longer than the sheaths. 
Roots finely fibrous, spongy. Heads i to i ^ lines in diame- 
ter, fuscous. Involucral scales obovate, scarious, very dark, 
eroded at the apex. Receptacle smooth. Bracts pointed. 
Flowers scarcely ^ line high. Exterior perianth segments in 
both kinds of flowers two ; the interior three. Sterile flower — 
outer segments free, pointed, entire ; inner with a short tube or 
stipitate, eroded or denticulate at the apex. Stamens six. Fer- 
tile flower — outer segments the same ; inner very narrow, shortly 
tubular at base. Ovary three or sometimes two-celled. Style 
three or sometimes two-parted.

2. DUPATYA, Veil. Fl. Flum. 35, No. 42 (1825). 

PcBpalantJius, Mart. Nov. Act. Nat. Cur. xvii. i, 13 (1833-5). 

This genus closely resembles Eriocaidon in general appear- 
ance and habit, but is distinguished by having the interior seg- 
ments of the sterile flower campanulate-tubular, and the stamens 
of the same number as the lobes. The flowers arc with rare ex- 
ceptions three-parted throughout, the three stigmas often bifid. 
Seeds oval, more or less costate. 

The genus is very extensively represented in South America, 
being concentrated in Brazil. Kornicke in his monograph 
enumerates 215 species. Only one is found in North America.

I. DUPATYA FLAVIDULA (Mx.). 
Eriocatilon flaviditliim, Mx. FI. ii. i66 (1803). 

PcepalantJms flavidiihtSy Kunth, Enum. iii. 532 (1841). 

Dnpatya flavidiila, Kuntze, Rev. Gen. PI. 745 (1891). 

Leaves i to 2 inches long, three to five-nerved, linear-subu- 
late, floccose at base and smooth or sparingly pubescent above. 
Scapes numerous, five-sulcate, pubescent, 4 to 12 inches high. 
Sheaths longer than the leaves, obliquely fissured, slightly inflated 
at the summit, pubescent like the scape. Heads 2 to 3 lines in 
diameter. Involucral scales straw colored, scarious, smooth, shin- 
ing, oval or ovate, obtuse, somewhat hairy at base. Receptacle 
pilose. Bracts very thin, white, linear, rounded or pointed at 
the apex, about as long as the flowers, slightly hairy, often obsolete. 
Flowers about \y^ line high, trimerous, long pedicellate. Sterile 
flowers — outer perianth segments woolly at base, obovate or trun- 
cate and pilose at the apex. This encloses the inner part of the 
perianth consisting of a smooth, delicate, white ; campanulate. 
Somewhat three- toothed tube ; stamens three, slightly exserted. 
Fertile flowers — outer perianth segments distinct, hairy at base, 
linear, acute, smooth, white, upper similar but much narrower, 
enclosing the ovary and connate over it nearly to the top. Style 
three-parted, forming three stigmas. Seeds sparingly and ob- 
scurely costate when mature. Roots spongy, scarcely nodose. 

Kornicke (Linnaea, 27, 590) under the name Eriocaiilon flavi- 
duluin, Mx., following Pursh (Fl. i, 92) and Elliott (Bot. ii 566) 
states that two plants have been sent from North America under 
this name and that he regards Kunth&apos;s P. flavidiilus as some- 
thing distinct from the plant of Michaux. That which he de- 
scribes is undoubtedly something distinct and is clearly an 
Eriocanlon, but, so far as I can judge, it corresponds very nearly, 
if not quite, to E. articidatum. The plant of Elliott is also, I 
think, that species. Michaux distinctly calls his species piibern- 
lent and the scapes aggregated and five-striate, while his other 
characters correspond very well with our plant. There is not, 
so far as ascertained, any other in the habitat given by him, 
&quot; Carolina &quot; that bears such characters.

3. LACHNOCAULON, Kunth, Enum. iii. 497 (1841). 

Very similar to Eriocatilon in general appearance and habit, 
but distinguished by having the outer perianth only, the flowers 
always three-parted, three stamens which coalesce in a tube be- 
neath, and one-celled anthers. The staminal tube appears to 
take the place of the sterile outer perianth segments of Eriocau- 
lon and PcepalantJms, and the place of the inner segment of the 
fertile flower is occupied in this genus by a loose mass of hairs, or 
sometimes by three rows of hairs. Style club-shaped, dividing 
Into three bifid stigmas which alternate with three appendices. 

The genus is confined to the Southern United States, in 
which four species occur. 

I. LACHNOCAULON ANCEPS (Walt) 

Eriocatilon anceps, Walt. Fl. Car. 83 (1788). 

E. villosiini, Mx. Fl. ii. 166, (1803) Pursh, Fl. i. 92, (1814). 

L. Michauxii, Kunth, Enum. iii. 497, (1841) Chap. Fl. 504, 
(i860). 

Leaves i to 3 inches long, tapering to an obtuse callous point, 
smooth or sparingly hairy, seven to twelve-nerved or often appar- 
ently nerveless. Scapes slender, 2 to 20 inches high, two to four- 
ribbed, the ribs themselves often with intermediate striae, clothed 
with long, soft, appessed, upwardly-pointed hairs. Sheaths as 
long as or shorter than the leaves, hairy like the scape, and 
pointed like the leaves. Heads globose, i to 3 inches in diame- 
ter. Involucral scales ovate or oblong, obtuse or pointed, 
smooth or hairy, shorter than the flowers, usually fuliginous. 
Flowers about i line high, bracts fuliginous, spatulate, often 
keeled, surrounded at base by the yellowish, silky hairs of the 
villose receptacle and white bearded at the apex. Perianth seg- 
ments in the sterile flower on a short stipe which is hairy at the 
base, spatulate, fuliginous and fimbriate at the apex. Those of 
the fertile flower white, smooth, oblong, obtuse ; ovary sessile, 
densely villous around the base ; style threcTdivided ; stigmas 
bifid, seeds strongly costate. Roots finely fibrous. The white 
segments of the fertile perianth mingled with the fuliginous 
woolly segments of the sterile flowers impart a mixed gray and 
dark appearance to the heads.

2. Lachnocaulon glabrum, Korn. 

L. glabrum, Korn. Linnaea, xxvii. 568, (1854), Chap. Fl. 504, 
(i860). 

Leaves i^ to ^ inch long, flat, acuminate, blunt and callous 
at the tips, about as long as the sheaths, smooth or with a few 
scattered hairs at the margins. Scapes numerous, smooth, 3 to 
4 inches high, and three to five-angled. Heads very dark and 
nearly smooth externally, at first globose, becoming cylindrical 
or slightly conical and 3 lines long, looking, as Chapman ob- 
serves, not unlike those of Eleocharis ovata. Involucral scales 
fuscous, lighter in color than the bracts and flowers, ovate, acute, 
smooth or pubescent. Receptacle villous with clavate hairs. 
Bracts very dark, pubescent, carinate on the back and cucullate 
at the apex, enclosing the flowers. Flowers scarcely yi inch 
high, much smaller than those of No. i. Segments woolly at 
base, the anterior much like the bract and partially enclosing 
the others. The peculiar dark, matted, and smoothish appear- 
ance of the heads in this species is owing to the cucullate bracts 
and flowers which are closely packed together. 

Roots finely fibrous, not nodose. Ovary three-celled, styles 
divided into three stigmas. Kornicke makes the stigmas bifid, 
but in all the specimens that I have examined they are entire. 
Seeds strongly costate.

3. Lachnocaulon Beyrichianum, Sperdeler. 

L. Beyrichiaimm, Sperdeler in Korn Linnaea, xxvii. 567, 
(1854)- 

Leaves bright green, i to i ^ inch long, tapering to a 
sharp point, obscurely nerved, often woolly at base, scantily 
hairy above, somewhat longer than the sheaths. Scapes numer- 
ous, I to 3 inches high, three to five-striate, sparsely hairy, the 
hairs like those of No. i. Heads globose or cylindrical and 
slightly longer than broad, i to i ^ lines long, grayish- villose, 
the hairs very apparent. Involucral scales oblong, obtuse, hairy 
or becoming glabrate, fuscous. Bracts spatulate, somewhat 
larger than the flowers, smooth or grayish pubescent above. 
Segments of perianth much the same. Flowers scarcely half a 



362 

line high. Receptacle hairy as in No. 2. Styles divided into 
three simple stigmas. 

Kornicke attributes this species to Ebenezer, a place in mid- 
dle Georgia, collected there in July by Beyrich. Tt was dis- 
tributed as L. glabrum by Curtiss, No. 3,022, collected by him 
on &quot; Sandy shores, Walton County, N. W. Florida.&quot; September. 

Bentham and Hooker (Gen. PL iii. part 2, p. 1,024) regard 
Kornicke&apos;s plants as well developed specimens of L. anceps, but 
the species is quite distinct both from L. anccps 2S\(S. L. glabrum. 
From the former it is distinguished by its much smaller size, 
numerous scapes, smaller and more elongated heads, obtuse 
involucral scales, far smaller flowers and simple stigmas ; from the 
latter b}^ its hairy scapes, grayish-villose, nearly globose and far 
smaller heads. 

4. L.\CHNOCAULON DIGYNUM, Korn. 

L. digynnm, Korn. Linnaea, xxvii. 570, (1854). 

I have not seen specimens of this. Kornicke attributes it to 
Alabama, from whence it was sent by Bentham, and describes it 
as having a leafy epigean stem ^^ to i ^ inch in length. 
Leaves smooth, nervose-striate, flat, bright green, 4 to 7 lines 
long. Scapes smooth, 3 to 5 inches high. Sheaths obliquely 
fissured, sparsely pilose, a Httle longer than the leaves. Heads 
semi-globose, i line in diameter, grayish-villose. Involucral 
scales oblong, acute, ciliate at the apex and villous on the back, 
at length glabrescent, fuscous. Bracts spatulate, carinate. Re- 
ceptacle pilose. Flowers pedicellate ; segments of the perianth 
connate toward the base, spatulate, rounded and hairy at the 
apex. Stamens three, anthers oblong, white; the triple seg- 
ments of the rudimentary pistil in the sterile flower papillose. 
Fertile flowers sessile, segments of the perianth free, obovate, nar- 
rowed at the base, pilose at the top of the back. It differs, ac- 
cording to Kornicke, from all the preceding species in having a 
two-celled ovary, two appendices, a two-parted style and bifid 
stigmas. 

It is regarded by Benth. and Hook. 1. c. as probably a 
depauperate form of L. aticeps, with heads not yet well devel- 
oped, but it appears to me to come much nearer to L. Bcyrichia- 
num. Fresh specimens are very desirable.

The name of this plant has had a very curious history, which 
I am now prepared to trace, having seen authentic specimens ot 
all the above-cited descriptions. First characterized by Pursh, 
who gave it a name already belonging to an P^gyptian or Arabi- 
an plant, it was next alluded to by Dr. Torrey, under the name 
R. delphinifolius. Pursh&apos;s type was collected by Bradbury in 
&quot; Upper Louisiana,&quot; and is preserved in the Herbarium of the 
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Torjey&apos;s plant 
was from New York, and a specimen bearing the label in his own 
liandwriting is contained in the Kew Herbarium, &quot;7?. delpJiinifoliiis, 
Torr. in Eat. Man. Ed. 2.&quot; In his catalogue of plants within 
thirty miles of New York (18 19), Torrey adopted Bigelow&apos;s name 
R. fluviatilis for the species; in his Compendium he took R. 
imiltifidiis, and in the Flora of North America and Plora of New 
York he called it R. Purshii, never returning to his original 
name for it. I have been unable to ascertain his reason for this 
course. Perhaps, he thought this was preoccupied by the 



364 

homonym of Humboldt, Bonpland and Kunth, which was pub- 
Hshed, however, three years later. 

In his discussion of this plant in Pittonia, ii. 62, Professor 
Greene adopts the name of Beck and Tracy and I have followed 
him in alluding to it, but the Kew specimen from Dr. Torrey and 
a glance at the second edition of Eaton&apos;s Manual are conclusive 
proof that we have been wrong. 

The arctic and Rocky Mountain plant, R. Purs/m, Richards, 
Frank. Journ, 741 (1823); R limosus, Nutt, R. miiltifidus, var. 
repens, S. Wats., appears to me to be specifically distinct. It is 
a creeping, pubescent, uliginous species with smaller flowers and 
smaller achenes which have an acutish back, and the style is 
slender ; R. delpJiinifolius is normally strictly aquatic, glabrous, 
its achenes have a thickened, almost winged margin, and the style 
is flat and broadened at the base. It develops broader leaf-seg- 
ments when the water in which it habitually grows becomes low 
and the plants thus become emersed. 

It should be added that a specimen from Dr. Torrey, labelled 
R. laciLstris, Beck and Tracy, is preserved in the Philadelphia 
Herbarium, and is the same species as R. multifidus, Pursh, 
which may be further proven by the figure of R. lacnstris pub- 
hshed by Beck and Tracy in Trans. Albany Inst. i. plate V. I 
have not access to a copy of the first edition of Eaton&apos;s Manual.

335 (1786). 

R. aquatilis, var. trichophyllus, A. Gray, Man. Ed. 5, 40 
(1867). 

I think this should rank as a species rather than a variety of 
R. aquatilis, L., which only exists in America, as far as known, 
in the far northwest, where it is represented by the var. Jictero- 
phyllns, as pointed out by Dr. Gray. 

Hypericum mutihun, L. Sp. PI. 787 (i753)- 

Ascyriiin Crux-Andre&lt;2, L. loc. cit. 

While it may, perhaps, be ascribed to a blunder in the make- 
up of the first edition of the &quot;Species Plantarum,&quot; there is no 
doubt whatever that Linnaeus described the. same plant as two 



365 

species in different genera on the same page. This has been in- 
dicated by Torrey and Gray, (Fl. N. A. i. 672). The specimen 
described by Plukenet (Mant. 104), as &quot; Hypericoides ex terra 
Mariana floribus exiguis luteus &quot; on which Linnaeus based his A. 
Crux-Andrcce, is preserved in the Sloane Herbarium, (vol. 92, p. 
85), at the British Museum of Natural History, and x^ Hypericum 
tnutilinn, while the specimens of Gronovius, on which he based 
H. mutilmn, are in the general herbarium of the same institution. 
The plant taken up by Torrey and Gray for A. Crux-AndrccB is 
A. hypericoides, L. Sp. PI. 788, as evidenced by the Gronovian 
specimen on which it is based, fortunately also preserved. 

President Coulter, in his paper on the North American Hype- 
ricaceae (Bot. Gaz., 1886, 80), has maintained that we have two 
closely related species of .^.y^j/r?^;^, associating specimens from the 
southern states with the tropical American plant which Linnaeus 
took up for his A. hypericoides in the second edition of his Spe- 
cies Plantarum (p. 1108), basing it on specimens sent him by P. 
Browne from Jamaica, one of which is preserved in his herba- 
rium. However, whether we have one species or two, the north- 
ern plant is the original A. hypcjHcoides, and should bear that 
name. All the specimens in the Columbia College Herbarium, 
including many from Florida, are readily referable to it, and dif- 
ferent from the West Indian and Central American species. 

Hypericum Canadense, L., var. minimitm, Choisy in DC. 
Prodr. i. 550. 

The type of this is preserved in the &quot; Prodromus Herbarium &quot; 
at Geneva. It is a fragment of a three-styled species with narrow 
leaves, not satisfactorily referable to H. Canadense, though it 
may as well be that as anything else, and its origin is unknown. 
From Choisy&apos;s remarks at the place of publication, he apparently 
thought it was Mexican. In any event it is not at all the North- 
ern plant with oval or orbicular lower leaves which has been re- 
fered to it, and which may be called H. Canadense, var. 
BOREALE.

From the very great difference in appearance of the extreme 
forms of this plant, I had about come to the conclusion that P. 
simplex, the large, ascending or erect condition, was actually 
specifically distinct from the smaller one with prostrate branches. 
But a study of the plant during the past spring in the vicinity of 
New York has convinced me that simplex cannot be separated 
even as a variety, for I found them growing from the same clump. 
In shaded woodlands the simplex condition prevails, while the 
other prefers open places, and reaches its extreme degree of de- 
pression (var. pumilio, T. and G.) in very dry, sterile soil. There 
is, therefore, no more reason for maintaining varieties in it than 
in the case of Erigeron Canadense, which varies from an inch in 
height to ten feet or more. The type of P. Catiadense, L is pre- 
served in the Linnaean Herbarium, and that of P. simplex, Michx. 
in the herbarium of Michaux at Paris, and so far as they go, are 
correctly understood. 

RUBUS MiLLSPAUGHI, n. sp. 

Ascending, wand-like, entirely unarmed or with a very few, 
weak prickles above, glabrous throughout or the younger shoots 
scurfy-pubescent. Stems 1)^-4 meters long; leaves long-peti- 
oled, pedately five-foliolate or some of those on the twigs three- 
foliolate; leaflets thin, oval, glabrous on both sides, long-acumi- 
nate at the apex, mostly rounded at the base, 12-15 cm. long, 
about 5 cm. wide, sharply but not deeply serrate ; stalk of the 
terminal leaflet 7-10 cm. long; inflorescence loosely racemose; 
bracts linear-lanceolate; pedicels slender, ascending; sepals 
lanceolate, acuminate; fruit black, about 10 mm. long. 

In rich woods, Point Mt., West Virginia, at 3,500 ft. altitude 
(C. F. Millspaugh). Nearest to R. villosus, but evidently a dis- 
tinct species Curiously enough there is a leaf of this plant glued 
down on the sheet ot R. Camidensis, L. in Herb. Linn., and it 
appears to have been included in his description of that species — 
the specimens furnished by Kalm. 

Agrij/iouia striata, M.\chx. Fl. Bor. Am. i. 287 (1803). 
A. Eupatoria of most American authors, not of L. 
A. Eupatoria, v^x. parvijlora, Hook. i. 196 (1832). 

The American plant has certainly been erroneously referred 
to the European^. Eupatoria, which is very distinct from it, by 
its larger flowers and fruit, denser inflorescence, much greater 



367 

amount of pubescence and different foliage. The genus Agnmo- 
nia was monographed by Wallroth in his &quot; Beitrage zur Bo- 
tanik,&quot; i. i-6i (1842), and a much larger number of species 
recognized than have since been admitted. There is at least one 
of his North American species there first described, which seems 
to me perfectly good ; this is : 

Agrimonia microcarpa, Wallr. Beitr. i. 33, 39, t. i. f- 3- 
(1842). 

Smaller and more slender than A. striata, villous-pubescent at 
least below, Lar&lt;^er leaflets 3-5, obovate, obtuse or sometimes 
acutish at the apex, narrowed or cuneate at the base, dentate, 
1)^-5 cm. long, glabrous or nearly so above, generally pubescent 
along the veins beneath ; raceme very slender, the flowers short- 
pedicelled, less than two lines broad ; petals slightly exceeding 
the calyx-lobes ; fruit smaller, about 3 mm. long. 

In dry soil, Pennsylvania (according to Wallroth), Maryland 
(Rusby), to Florida (Chapman), west to Kentucky (Short) and 
Louisiana (Carpenter). 

Mamillaria NOTESTEINII, n. sp. 

Stems oval, simple or caespitose, about 3 cm. in diameter. 
Tubercles nearly terete and about 6 mm. high ; spines 12-18, 
white, becoming gray with age, weak and slender, 8-12 mm. 
long, spreading, pubescent throughout. Usually each tubercle 
bears a central spine which is longer and stouter than the others, 
and is frequently tipped with pink ; flowers 15-25 mm. in diame- 
ter, ash-gray, tinged and penciled with a delicate pink. Petals 
broadly linear-oblong, mucronate tipped ; fruit obovoid ; seeds 
black, globose, pitted. 

Found in gravelly soil, near a small creek, in the vicinity of 
Deer Lodge, Montana, by Prof F. N. Notestein, June,4th, 1891. 

OxYPOLIS, Raf Neogen. 2 (1825). 

Tiedemannia, DC. Mem. Omb. 51, t. 12 (1829). 
Archemora, DC. loc. cit. 52 (1829). 
Rafinesque characterizes the genus and cites Siuni rigidins, 
L. as the type, so there can be no question&apos; about what he had in 
mind. This plant is well known to be Archemora rigida, DC, 
and Tiedemannia rigida, Coult. and Rose. 
Ptiliminum, Raf Neogen. 2 (1825). 

Discopleiira, DC, Mem. Omb. 38 (1829).

Rafinesque also characterizes this genus and gives Ainmi 
capillacenm, Michx., as the type. This is Discopleura capilla- 
cea, DC. 

Spermolepis, Raf. Neogen. 2 (1825), not Brong.&amp;Gris. 

Lcptocaitlis, DC. Mem. Omb. (1829). 
This genus is based on Dauais divaricatus, Walt., which is 
Sison pusillum, Michx., Leptocaiilis divaricatus, DC, and Apiiim 
divaricatum, Wood. If this species and its allies are to be kept 
distinct from Apium, L. as has been done by Coulter and Rose, 
it should be under Rafinesque&apos;s generic name. 
Adorium, Raf Neogen. 3 (1825). 

Marathrum, Raf Journ. Phys. Ixxxix. loi (18 19), not 
Humb. and Bonpl. 

Museimim, Nutt. in T. and G. Fl. N. A., i. 642 (1840). 

Perceiving that the generic name MaratJiriLin was already 
used, Rafinesque substituted for it Adorium, eleven years before 
Nuttall named Musenium. The names of Rafinesque and Nuttall 
are both based on Seseli divaricatum, Pursh. 

Solidago juncea. Ait. var. RAMOS A, Porter and Britton, n. var. 

Differs from the typical plant in the numerous, strict, erect 
branches, the racemes numerous, slender, erect or slightly re- 
curved at the en&apos;ds. 

In fields, western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania 
(Porter), Ohio (Sullivant), and West Virginia (Millspaugh). 
Strikingly different in appearance from 5. juncea. Professor 
Porter informs me that he sent specimens of the plant to Dr. 
Gray, after the volume of the Synoptical Flora containing the 
Compositae was issued, and was told that he had not seen it before. 

Cyperus Hoiightoni, Torn Ann. Lye. N. Y. iii. 277 (1836). 

This species was described by Dr. Torrey from a si^ecimen 
collected by Dr. D. Houghton at the Lake of the Isles, North- 
west Territory, in August, 1831, (No. 73), and the type of it is 
preserved in the Columbia College Herbarium. He subsequently 
concluded that it was not distinct from his C. ScJiweinitzii, as is 
indicated in pencil in his copy of the Monograph of North 
American Cyperaceae, and in his copy of Steudel&apos;s Cyperaceae. 
In his herbarium the types of both species are mounted on the 



369 

same sheet. I passed the plant over in my Preliminary List of 
North American Species of Cyperus, (BULLETIN, xiii. 205-216), 
having only the original specimen to go by, and accepting Dr. 
Torrey&apos;s later view. But recently I have had numerous speci- 
mens from the Northwest and other regions, which maintain the 
characters of the original, and satisfactorily establish the species 
as a good one. 

My attention has been especially called to it by Mr. John M. 
Holzinger, Assistant Botanist to the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture, who last year sent me abundant specimens collected by 
Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., at Camp Douglas, Wisconsin. I 
did not then recognize in these Torrey&apos;s species, and was disposed 
to regard the plant as undescribed. Mr. Holzinger has again 
sent me more and very fine specimens of Dr. Mearns&apos; collection 
of 1 89 1, and thusby impressing on me the characters of the plant, 
caused me to make a careful examination of the group to which 
it belongs. 

The species is nearest C. ScJnvenitzii, but readily distinguish- 
abte from that plant by its globose, dense heads, smooth culms, 
&apos;shorter and broader truncate or apiculate scales, and shorter 
nut. I have it now from the following localities : Lake of the 
Isles, N. W. Terr., (Houghton No. 73); Camp Douglass, Wise, 
(Mearns No. 28); St. Croix River, Minn., (Holzinger); Cheboy- 
gan Co., Mich., (C. F. Wheeler); Wichita, Kans., (Carleton); 
Columbia River, Sand Island, Oregon, (Thos. Howell); Kuskuski 
River, (Wilkes Exp.); Wareham, Mass., (Ex. Herb. L. H. 
Bailey); Lake George, N. Y., (Wm. H. Leggett). It thus ranges 
all across the continent. I referred the Oregon specimens col- 
lected by Geyer, which I saw in Herb. Gray to this species in 
my Preliminary List, but was uncertain about them. They 
probably belong here. 

The plant which I described in my Preliminary List (p. 208) 
as C. Schwcinitzii, var. debilis, which extends from Colorado 
(Redfield) to Chihuahua, is most likely another distinct species. 

Rynchospora saitellata, Griesb. Cat. PL Cub. 246 (1866). 

This species, founded on Charles Wright&apos;s No. 3406 from 
Western Cuba, was collected by the late Mr. H. W. Ravenel on 
damp prairies near Indianola, Texas, May 3d, 1869, (No. 160), 



370 

and distributed under the manuscript name Ceratoschoenus hre- 
virostris, n. sp. I am indebted to Mr. C. B. Clarke for the de- 
termination. The following description may serve for its identi- 
fication: Stem erect, rather stout, 3-9 dm. high, glabrous. Leaves 
linear, flat, the lower 3-4 dm. long, 6-8 mm. wide, slightly rough- 
ened on the margins, those of the stem distant, shorter ; spikelets 
lanceolate 6-10 mm. long, three to five-flowered in corymbose 
clusters, the rays slender, unequal, 2^-5 cm. long ; clusters com- 
posed of three to five spikelets ; glumes brown, ovate, acute, 
mucronate, the fertile ones larger than the sterile ; nut brown, 
ovate or obovate, compressed, slightly concave on each face, 
3-4 mm. long, finely puncticulate, with a rather prominent keel 
on both edges ; beak black, compressed, conic, about as long as 
the nut, slightly papillose, bristles slender, unequal, the larger 
equaling or slightly exceeding the nut, finely barbed upwardly. 
The Texan specimen differs from the Cuban only in its 
larger and denser clusters and somewhat narrower nut. The 
species comes next to R. corniculata, (Lam.) 

Stenophyllus, Raf Neogen. 4(1825). 

This proposed genus of Rafinesque is briefly characterized by 
him and Scirpus stenophylluSy Ell. named as the type. This plant 
is the same as Dichroma ccespitosa, Muhl., and was transferred to 
Isolepis by Dr. Torrey in his monograph of the North American 
Cyperaceae (Ann. Lye. N. Y. iii. 353, 1836). In 1837 Kunth 
(Enum, ii. 209) independently referred it to Isolepis, but under a 
section which he proposed should form a genus under the name 
Bulbostylis, although he did not name the species under that 
genus. I allude to Rafinesque&apos;s genus here because Mr. C. B. 
Clarke has sent me specimens of the Indian Isolepis barbata. a 
very closely allied species under the name Bulbostylis barbata, 
and informe me that he has adopted Kunth&apos;s genus as distinct 
from Fimbristylis and Scirpus in his forthcoming monograph of 
the Cyperaceae Rafinesque&apos;s generic name has twelve years 
priority over Kunth&apos;s. Our Fimbristylis capillaris (L.) and a 
number of tropical American species are congeners. The genus 
is especially distinguished by the thickened, persistent base of the 
style, and most of its species have ciliate leaves.

THE AMERICAN SPECIES OF THE GENUS 

ANEMONE AND THE GENERA WHICH 

HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO IT.

III. — The American Species of the Genus Anemone and the 
Genera which have been referred to it. 



BY N. L. BRITTON. 
Read October 12, 1891. 

The genus Anemone as recognized by Bentham and Hooker in 
1862 (Gen. PI., i, 4), contained on their estimate about 70 species; 
Durand (Index. Gen. Phanerog. 1 (1888) estimated that the num- 
ber then known was about 85, while Prantl (in Engler and PrantI, 
Naturl. Pflanzenfamilien, Lieferung 19, p. 61, 1888), placed the 
number at 90, including in this estimate the 5 known species of 
Knowttonia; so we may take Durand&apos;s estimate as the last one 
made. It was monographed by Pritzel (Linn^ea, xv, 561-698, 
1841). The species are widely distributed in temperate and sub- 
arctic or alpine regions of both hemispheres. A few occur in warm 
temperate and tropical regions, but the group is essentially one of 
temperate climates ; 13 occur in Europe, 15 in British India, espe- 
cially in the Himalayas (Hooker, Fl. Brit. Ind., i, 7), 16 in China 
(Forbes and Hemsley, Journ, Linn. Soc, xxiii, 10), 2 in South 
Africa (Harvey and Sonder, Fl. Cap., i, 3), 1 in Australia (Ben- 
tham, FI. Austral., i, 8). In the following pages 39 species are 
recognized as American, placed in six genera, all of which are kept in 
Anemone by Bentham and Hooker, Baiilon, and Engler and Prantl. 

There has been no agreement among authors as to the limits of 
the genus, Tournefort recognized Anemone and Pulsatilla. Lin- 
meus in the earlier editions of his Genera Plantarum had Hepatica, 
Pulsatilla, and Anemone, but united them all in the first edition of 
his Species Plantarum. Adanson maintained Anemone and Pulsa- 
tilla. Jussiseu united all three. Among more recent authors there 
has been equal difference of opinion. Ledebour (Fl. Ross., i, 13-23) 
maintained the three as distinct, and this view is accepted by Nyman 
(Consp. Fl. Europ., 2-4). Gray has recognized Anemone, Pulsatilla 
and Hepatica in the first four editions of his Manual and in his 
Genera lUustrata, but united Pulsatilla with Anemone in the fifth 
Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci., VI, Dec. 1891.— 15

edition. Watson reduced them to Anemone in his Bibliographical 
Index, but in the sixth edition of Gray&apos;s Manual retains Hepatica 
as a genus. Freyn, who has recently studied Ranunculaceae, con- 
siders Pulsatilla distinct (Deutsche Bot. Monats., viii, 78, 1890). 

I am satisfied after a study of nearly all the described species that 
the first treatment of the group by Linnasus is the most satisfactory. 
There is perhaps less reason for keeping Anemone and Pulsatilla 
distinct than for separating Hepatica, but I find no transitions from 
Pulsatilla to Anemone, and it forms a very natural group of species 
both as to structure, habit, and geographical distribution through- 
out the north temperate zone. 

As to the other genera referred to Anemone by recent authors I 
think them also clearly distinct. Syndesmon, Hoffm. (Anemonella, 
Spach), of eastern North America, has no close analogue in either 
Thalictrum or Anemone, to both of which it has been referred, and 
I entirely agree with Dr. Watson in keeping it as a genus, although 
under the older of the two generic names. Barneoudia, Gay, species 
of extra-tropical South America, are to me very different from any 
true Anemone or Hepatica, and very circumscribed in distribution. 
Knowltonia, of South Africa, referred to Anemone by Baillon and 
Engler and Prantl, but kept up by Bentham and Hooker, I regard 
as distinct for similar reasons. 

The essential characters of the genera known to occur in America 
as understood by me may be indicated as follows : — 

Achenia with long, plumose, persistent styles ; outer stamens often sterile ; 
involucre remote from the flower, 3-leaved ; radical leaves digitately much 
divided 1- Pulsatilla. 

Achenia glabrous, pubescent, or woolly, with short, subulate, not plumose 
styles ; stamens all antheriferous ; involucre remote from the flower or 
flowers, 1-3-leaved, the leaves sessile or petioled ; radical leaves various. 

2. Anemone. 

Achenia pubescent, short-beaked ; stamens all antheriferous ; involucre ap- 
proximate to the flower, 3-leaved, calyciform, the leaves sessile ; radical 
leaves petioled, 3-lobed or sometimes 5-7-lobed 3. Hepatica. 

Achenia? carpels densely villous-pubescent ; style glabrous ; lilauients all 
antheriferous; involucre ; leaves petioled, entire 4. Capetllia. 

Achenia cylindric ; style filiform ; stigma papillose ; outer stamens dilated and 
petaloid ; involucre 5-6-leaved or 5-6-lobed, contiguous with the flower ; 
radical leaves entire, lobed or bifid 5. Barneoildia. 

Achenia columnar, terete, deeply grooved, the stigma sessile and truncate ; 
stamens all antheriferous ; involucre distant from the flower, of 2-3, 
sessile, ternate, long-stalked leaflets ; radical leaves 2-3-ternately com- 
pound 6. Syudesnion.

Erect, slender, more or less appressed-pubescent, 6^5 cm. high. Radical 
leaves slender-petioled, repeatedly divided into oblong or linear, acute, den- 
tate or entire segments ; leaves of the involucre sessile, similarly divided into 
narrowly linear or filiform segments; flower solitary, white (?), 12-2.5 mm. 
broad ; sepals 5-16, linear-oblong, obtuse or obtusish ; head of fruit 16-25 
mm. long ; style short. 

Distrib. Southern Brazil, Uruguay, the Argentine Republic, and 
eastern Chili and Bolivia. Brazil: (St. Hilaire; Sellow, 1161). 
Uruguay: Montevideo (Commerson ; Courbon, 120; Fox, 366;

Closely related to A. decapetala, differing in its finely divided 
radical leaves, which are often of the aspect of those of some 
Thalict7&apos;ums. 

I have not seen Yahl&apos;s specimen, but his figure and description 
are entirely satisfactory. The type of A. funiariaefolia, Juss., is

This has been referred by nearly all recent American authors, 
myself included, to A. decapetala, but erroneously.

Erect, more or less pubescent, 10-60 cm. Radical leaves slender-petioled 
ternately divided, the divisions obovate, obtuse, cuneate at the base, variously 
lobed and cleft ; leaves of the involucre short-petioled or sessile by a narrowed

short. 

Type in Herb. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris. 

The species has usually been referred to A. decapetala, but is in 
my judgment distinct, sharing the peculiarity of so many plants of 
eastern and western America in being closely related but different. 

Distrih. Chili and the southwestern United States. Chili : 
(Poeppig, 151 (type), 150; Bertero, 801, 46; Gaudichaud, 224; 
Gay, 30; Dorabey; Cuming, 645; Philippi, 254; Bridges, 2G ;

(M. E. Jones, 160t; Johnson; Parry, 1); New Mexico (Wright, 
1304; Fendler, Mexican Boundary Survey, 8; near Silver City 
(Greene); Arizona: Sierra Tucson (Pringle) ; Verde River Mesa 
(Smart). 

All the Chilian plants which have been referred to A. decapetala 
apparently belong to this species. The North American specimens 
appear to me to be identical with the Chilian.

&quot;Habitat in Brasilia, Sellow, Coll. PI. Bras., 891.&quot; 
All I know of this plant is drawn from Pritzel&apos;s original descrip- 
tion, and that of Eichler in Martius Flora Brasiliensis, xiii, part i, 
153, t. 34, where the specimen contained in the Berlin Herbarium 
is beautifully figured. As suggested by Eichler, the species is allied 
to A. Aritucensis, Poepp., but the engraving shows that it is clearly 
distinct.

The specimen on which this species is based is in the Kew Her- 
barium, derived from the herbarium of the late John Ball. Xo 
flowers nor fruit remain upon it, but from the note by Mr. Ball, 
above quoted, he appears to have seen the fruit. The plant has a 
decidedly different aspect from B. major. It is labelled Anemone

Review of the North American Species 
of the Genus Xyris.

(Reprinted from Bulletin of the Torkey Botanical Club, Vol. XIX, No. 3, Feb. 1892.) 



Review of the North American Species of the Genus Xyris. 

By Heinrich Ries. 
Plate CXXIV. 

While engaged in a study of this genus during the past win- 
ter, I found great confusion existing among the various species. 
The most complete list of the North American species thus far 
published is in Chapman&apos;s Flora of the Southern States ; but 
even here the descriptions are hardly sufficiently accurate, and 
all the species cannot be maintained. It has therefore seemed 
to me desirable to present this revjsion of the genus, the arrange- 
ment of which is based on specimens in the herbarium at Harvard 
College, Agricultural Department at Washington, and those of 
Messrs. J. D. Smith, W. M. Canby, as well as the herbarium of 
Columbia College. The majority of the species are confined to 
the Southern States. The genus may be defined as follows : 

Perennial, stemless herbs. Roots usually fibrous, sometimes 
bulbous. Leaves linear or linear-lanceolate, collected about the 
base of the naked scape. Scales convex, horny, thicker in the 
middle. Flowers single in the axils of the scales, which are col- 
lected into a more or less dense spike. Sepals three, the two 
lateral ones glumaceous and keeled, enclosing a third membran- 
ous one. Petals three, clawed. Stamens six, three of which are 
fertile and situated on the claws of the petals, the alternate ones 
being sterile. Anthers linear. Ovary one-celled, three- valved; 
the valves bearing the placenta along the middle. Stigma one, 
style three- cleft. The modifications of the keel of the lateral 
sepals form valuable specific characters.

X. stricta, Chapm. Fl. S. U. S. 498 (i860). 
X. rhovibipetala, Sauv. Fl. Cub. 160 (1868). 

Scape rigid, sHghtly twisted, furrowed, two-edged above, 2- 
3 feet high; leaves linear-lanceolate, 6-12 inches long, smooth 
and shining ; spikes ovate-lanceolate, oblong or cylindric, gen- 
erally acute, sometimes obtuse, many-flowered; bracts convex, 
light brown ; lateral sepals lanceolate, shining, the upper two- 
thirds of the narrowly winged keel fringed and tapering at both 
ends.

X. stricta, Chapm, is undoubtedly the same as X. amhigiia. 
Dr. Chapman speaks of the leaves of the former as being rough- 
edged, while those of the latter are smooth. I am unable to find 
such a difference. Again the heads of ambigua are said to be 
oblong, ovate-lanceolate or acute, while those of stricta are ob- 
long or cylindric. The heads of ambigua are often obtuse and 
cylindric, while those of stricta are sometimes acute. I can find 
no constant difference in the shape of the sepals. 

In X. rho7iibipetala, Sauv. the shape of the sepal and whole 
form of the plant are the same as in ambigua.

X. partita, Chapm. Mss. in Herb. Col. Coll. 

Scapes straight, twisted, two-edged above, one-angled below, 
leaves linear to linear-lanceolate, 4-12 inches long; spikes many- 
flowered, ovate or round; margin of scale usually smooth; 
lateral sepals lanceolate, the upper two-thirds of the winged keel 
fimbriate. 

X. difformis, Chap., is the same as X. cornmiinis, Kunth, the 
sepals and whole appearance of the two plants being alike. 

The comparisons of communis and gymnoptera with difformis 
were based on C. Wright, Cuba, No. 3734; Eggers, St. Domingo, 
No. 2101, det. by Dr. Urban, at Berlin; Sintenis, Porto Rico,

8. Xyris serotina, Chapm. 

X. serotina, Chapm. Fl. S. U. S , 500 (i860). 
X. fasciailaris, Chapm. Mss. in Herb. Col. Coll. 

Scape straight, twisted, striate, 2-edged above and i-i;^ feet 
high; leaves linear-lanceolate, surface papillose, wide, spikes ovoid 
or globose, scales rounded, lateral sepals linear, upper third of 
keel-wing incised-fimbriate. 

Florida. — Apalachicola, A. W. Chapman, 1861. 

There are some small specimens in the Columbia College 
Herbarium, collected by Dr. Hale in Louisiana. The leaves are 
1-2 inches long; scape 3-5 inches high. The sepals are those of 
serotina and the leaves show the papillose surface, characteristic 
o{ serotina, near the base. They are probably young plants of 
this species.

9- Xyris Caroltniana, Walt. 

X. Caroliniana, Walt. Fl. Car. 69 (1788). 

X elata, Chapm. Fl. S. U. S. 501 (i860). 

X. serotina, van Chapm. Mss. in Herb. Col. Coll. 

X. graminifolia, Chapm. Mss. in Herb. Col. Coll. 

Scapes solitary or clustered, twisted and two-edged above, 
1-2 feet high; leaves linear or linear-lanceolate, 4-15 inches 
long ; spikes globose or ovate, or sometimes oblong ; scales 
brown, becoming curled and the margin lacerated with age ; 
lateral sepals linear, the upper third of the narrowly winged keel 
incised-serrate. 

Forms found in New England agree with Dr. Chapman&apos;s type 
of elata, and if this species could be maintained would extend 
its range. This, however, seems doubtful, as forms intermediate 
between Caroliniana and elata exist, and show that the two pass 
into each other.

OF THE 



Species of the Genus Meibomia. Heist.. 

OCCURRING IN THE 

United States and British America.

A Preliminary List of the Species of tiie Genus Meibomia, Heist., 
occurring in the United States and British America. 

By Anna M. Vail. 

The genus Hedysanmt in Linnaeus&apos; Genera Plantarum, ed. i. 
225, published in 1737, and referred by him to Tournefort, com- 
prised Onobrychis, Hedysariim, Alhagi and Meibomia. The 
first reference to Meibomia, as distinct from Hedysarum, that I 
have found is in the second edition of Ludvvig&apos;s Definitiones 
Generum Plantarum, 156, (1747). I have not access to the first 
edition of that work. According to Dr. Otto Kuntze, the genus 
was founded by Mohring (Hort. Priv. 65, 1736), and referred by 
him to Heister one year ahead of the Linnsean Genera Plantarum. 

According to the same author it was used by Manetti in 175 i 
and by Fabricius in 1753, and to these it may be added by Ad- 
anson (Fam. PL ii. 509) in 1763. Siegesbeck called it Hedysar- 
odes in 1736, but I have not found that name used subsequent to 

1737- 

St. Hilaire named the genus Pleicrolobtis in 1812, and Phyl- 

lodium and Desmodium, Desvaux, appeared in 1S13. 

The genus Desmodiiim was elaborated by DeCandolle in the 
second volume of the Prodromus in 1825, and the North Amer- 
ican species of the genus in the first volume of Torrey&amp;Gray&apos;s 
Synoptical Flora in 1838, and they have been followed by all re- 
cent writers. 

Thirty-nine species are enumerated in this list, which is an 
attempt to straighten out the rather complicated synonymy of 
the genus. The species of the Southwestern States are as yet 



108 

little understood, and a more extensive exploration of Arizona, 

Texas and New Mexico will doubtless reveal new or Mexican 

species within our borders, and perhaps change the status of some 

here recognized. 

My thanks are due to Dr. N. L. Britton for his help and 

many valuable suggestions, and also to Captain John Donnell 

Smith, Mr. Redfield, Dr. Sereno Watson and Prof. Macoun for 

their kindness in loaning their collections to me for examination.
