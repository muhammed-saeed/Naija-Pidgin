 March 7, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Pamela D ( 13 reviews ) Just another Levy restaurant that depends on hungry tourists that are trapped in an area with few other choices. They know we are not likely to be repeat customers. Better off with a hot dog from the vendor. Chicken was dried out and sides were cold with no flavor. Never thought I would miss McDonalds. May 29, 2011 Likes it Delicious, cheap and seems healthy. by Pyra-Danny ( 28 reviews ) I can cheer! McDonalds was finally kicked out of Downtown Disney-- who the heck wants to escape on vacation just to eat something they can eat at home? I&apos;d never heard of Pollo Camero (I was just happy McDonalds was gone) This building is actually a collection of four mini stores. Pollo Campero reminds me of Pollo Tropical (of which I&apos;m a big fan) with similar $6-8 meal pricing... this is on the cheaper side of Downtown Disney meals. My 1/4 chicken with lemon zest was grilled and heavily seasoned... but I was drooling while eating. The smell upon entering is intoxicating. The rice and beans helped to counterbalance the flavors. I wish there was a combo that already came with rice and beans because I would have liked to use my extra sides to try other things. Near the chairs, there&apos;s a salsa bar (of course). Onions? Cilantro? Fresh tomatoes? Mango salsa? I was a piggy trying as much as I could... and I liked what I tried. Most items mixed well with the taste of the grilled... more» I can cheer!

I felt like I was eating healthy through the chicken&apos;s preparation. Other stores within the Pollo Campero building include a beer and drink place, bakery, and salad store. I didn&apos;t get to try those... but I&apos;ll be returning to Pollo Campero next time because it counters the typical Downtown Disney price and it was relatively healthy. December 21, 2011 Likes it Best Chicken ever!! by hotjoejonas ( 2 reviews ) Love this place and it&apos;s my first time! Food is a little pricey but other than that it&apos;s great! Line is long but it&apos;s worth it. October 7, 2011 Likes it OMG!!Seriously delish!! by davari_patricia ( 2 reviews ) This place just opened in Webster, TX. The line is out the door! It is across the street from poor Taco Cabana. It is like a whole new world in flavor. I want to eat there two times a day. Truly Amazin!! March 27, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Beatriz Bernard ( 2 reviews ) Kids meal way over priced. Tried to get a healthy option for the kids $4.99 for 3 of the smallest grilled chicken strips ever, plain white rice (brands are extra) and No drink or toy. Won&apos;t catch me here again. Pollo tropical is way better. This is a tourist trap for those who don&apos;t know any better April 22, 2011 Mobile review by Werner ( 1 review ) Not what I expected, when I was little we used to go eat @ pollo campero all the time but this one @ downtown Disney doesn&apos;t have the same selection and its overpriced :(
