 ChellNapoleon - 11/22/2011 4:51 PM 0 Votes Report User Im Happy To be working by elaine&apos;s side because without her i would not know how to get through my days at work because she&apos;s like a second mother to me because she can tell if i have something on mind or not im just happy that god made a wonderful person like her to be in my life and im blessed to have her here. Umbs2 - 11/15/2011 4:48 PM 0 Votes Report User I&apos;m the girl who brought Elaine the journal. I was having a bad day and Ms.Elaine looked right into me and just brighted my day! She is truly one of my biggest inspirations and I only talked to her for less then a minute through that drive through window. Her laugh just makes you smile. If we had more people like her in this world it would be such a warm and iviting place. Thanks for recognizing the Jesus in her! sonja - 11/15/2011 2:52 PM 1 Vote Report User Just looking at Elaine on Woai.com made me smile! God has given Elaine a gift to share with others! You don&apos;t get customer service like she provides anymore! Bill Miller&apos;s is blessed to have her! SA Native - 11/11/2011 2:59 PM 1 Vote Report User How come their gallon bucket of tea only holds 3 quarts. No no refill on tea if you eat in the restaurant. 99 cent refills..... Marcus - 11/11/2011 2:52 PM 0 Votes Report User I love this story, and I sure wish I could share it on Facebook more easily. Sunshine3 - 11/11/2011 9:48 AM 2 Votes Report User This is one of the best stories I have seen all year. Thank you Don Harris for sharing Elaine with us!!!! woolybully - 11/11/2011 9:06 AM 2 Votes Report User I just love Elaine. I used to go to the Bill Millers on McCullough when she worked there. When I had a bad day at work and I would go through the drive through she always had a smile on her face and something positive to say. I know when she first started working at that location they took her off the speaker (at the drive through)for a time because some people were not used to the &quot;darling&quot; she always says. She is just so sincere and kind. You know working at a fast food restaurant is not the most glamours or easy job..and there she is so kind. maryjesse - 11/11/2011 8:49 AM 2 Votes Report User WOW..what a wonderful human being...If only we had more people like her. I will definitely make the trip to see her..thank you for such a wonderful story. laurel6 - 11/11/2011 7:42 AM 2 Votes Report User That is soo awesome! Elaine used to work at the Bill Miller&apos;s by my house on McCullough and i was so sad when she moved to a different location. But then it must have been fate that she moved to the Bill Miller&apos;s on San Pedro by my job in Monte Vista! I just love Elaine! And it is true, if your down you will not be for long she is a true spirit raiser! Love you Elaine! xoxox Cassandra R. Scott Click Here to Add Your Comments View All
