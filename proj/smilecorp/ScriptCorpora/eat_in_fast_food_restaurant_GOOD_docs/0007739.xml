 Banks Set to Post Blowout Mortgage Earnings for 2Q 
 
Refinancing activity continued to climb over the last three months, as did the gap between consumer and secondary market prices. Expect banks to report another quarter of strong mortgage revenues in the coming weeks.
 
 Business Borrowing Cooled in 2Q, Still Underpins Loan Growth 
 
Growth in commercial and industrial loans fell to the slowest pace in a year during the period, according to preliminary data. But the increase was still healthy enough to offset contractions in other loan categories, and help drive an expansion in balance sheets.
 
 Bank Tax Rate Slips as Outlook Improves 
 
The effective tax rate for banks has dropped to a range of roughly 30% to 32%, down from a range of roughly 32% to 33% in the years leading up to the recession. Recoveries of deferred tax assets might be the reason.
 
 Buyers&apos; Market in Bank Stock Offerings 
 
In a slow stretch for issuance of bank shares, companies looking to raise capital for acquisitions have come to the fore in offerings that have performed relatively well.

Discover Pushing for Chip-Card Acceptance by 2013
 Print Reprints Email Tweet 
Discover Financial Services is the latest card network to announce a conversion plan for the secure EMV chip-card standard in the U.S.

Its plan, which also affects Canada and Mexico, requires acquirers and direct-connect merchants to handle EMV card payments by next year. The chip-card standard, commonly called &quot;chip and PIN&quot; because it is often paired with a PIN, is used in many countries to improve security over magnetic-stripe cards.

Last year, Visa announced a conversion plan for accepting EMV cards. It set staggered deadlines that begin in October, 2012 and end in October, 2017. This year, MasterCard announced its own roadmap with a &quot;liability hierarchy&quot; that allows for any authentication method but provides the best incentives for those who use a PIN.

Discover said it will support online and offline authentication. It will support PIN transactions as well as signature ones. It will support contact payments and contactless ones, such as from a mobile phone built with an embedded chip.

Discover, of Riverwoods, Ill., says it accepted its first U.S. EMV payment in January at a Wal-Mart location. In other countries, Discover has supported the EMV standard for three years.

&quot;Enabling EMV in North America is a significant step in Discover&apos;s approach toward emerging payments, and clearly a necessary one,&quot; said Troy Bernard, Discover&apos;s global head of chip payment technology, said in a press release.
