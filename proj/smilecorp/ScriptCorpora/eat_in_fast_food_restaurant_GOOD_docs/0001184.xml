 An NHS trust paid 24,000 to shutdown a Burger King restaurant inside a hospital.
 

 The outlet in the entrance area of Croydon University Hospital in Surrey has sold burgers and high fat meals to patients for 14 years. 

 But it was replaced with a Costa Coffee outlet at hefty cost to the taxpayer in December last year following pressure from health campaigners. 

 The 24,000 cost is enough to cover the salary of lower grade nurse for a whole year.

 They accused the hospital of hypocrisy for taking money from the fast food chain at a time when Britain is undergoing an obesity crisis. 

 The Burger King was located close to notice boards promoting healthy eating. 

 Explaining the decision, Croydon Health Service said the &apos;world had changed&apos; since bosses signed the contract with Burger King in 1997 to open the fast food restaurant.
 

 Figures obtained under freedom of information laws reveal the NHS Trust paid 24,000 to Compass UK - the company operating the fast food franchise - to terminate the contract.

 The trust said none of the money would go to Burger King itself. 

 The hospital has to find 34.7million savings over the next three years and has been forced to axe 200 jobs and close four wards. 

 Hospital bosses hope to claw back some of the money by opening a new pharmacy in the entrance area. 

 The decision has been welcomed by Croydon North MP Malcolm Wicks. 

 The Labour MP said: &apos;From the first time I saw the wretched burger joint, I was upset about it. 
 
Controversial: The money to evict the unhealthy food outlet at Croydon University Hospital came out of the trust&apos;s budget
 
 &apos;Advertising and selling fast food, which is generally unhealthy, really grates with what a modern hospital is about. 

 &apos;I’ve badgered successive chief executives about getting rid of the thing, so I wouldn’t criticise the hospital for finally taking the right decision, though the costs are substantial.&apos; 

 Folake Segun from patients group Croydon Shadow Health Watch said: &apos;Hopefully the trust will take the opportunity to properly consult with the community before bringing in such companies in the future.&apos;
 

 he original contract was signed in 1997 between the hospital’s landlord Heathcrof Properties and Compass UK. 

 Croydon Health Service chief executive Nick Hulme said the hospital had never had direct control over what businesses operate in the entrance area. 

 He said: &apos;We made a business decision to invest in this change which will give our patients and visitors a better service.&apos;

Perhaps some of the improving patients would like something other than hospital food!

Disgraceful and yet they charge us to park our charges at punitive rates. Why on earth would a hospital allow any of these big chains to set up in the hospital. Argh I know, it&apos;s called money. Costa Coffee costa a lot. What happened to the little canteens and tea shops that vounteers&quot;friends of the hospital&quot;that use to run the shops for the benefit of the patients without ripping them off

As a member of Britain&apos;s thin community I consider this to be an attack on my human rights to be able to a meal of my choosing whilst visiting Croydon Hospital.

Having witnessed the hospital food in Maydie, sorry Croydon University Hospital I am quite upset that Burger King is going, it was a nice alternative to what was served up to patients and a treat for visitors.

Why is there a burger king in a hospital?

Living in Croydon myself, and having stayed overnight a few times at Croydon University Hospital (then it was called Mayday though), I can honestly say that they needed a Burger King there. The food dished out to patients is appalling, tasteless slop. The money to terminate the contract could have been used elsewhere - it is more of a concern to me that wards have been closed and staff lost. Plus, most of the customers that I saw at the BK counter were staff!!!!!!!

As a cappuccino (160 calories) and muffin (482 calories) can contain more calories than a cola (168 calories) and burger (284 calories) I&apos;d say the move was a big fat fail (figures obtained from the respective websites)
