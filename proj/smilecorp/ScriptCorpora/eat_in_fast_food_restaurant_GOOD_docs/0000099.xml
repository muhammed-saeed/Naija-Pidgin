Low-Salt Diets: Eating Out
 
Introduction

For many people, eating out is
 something they do to relax and socialize. You don&apos;t have to give this up when
 you are on a low-sodium diet, but it is important to be more careful about what
 you order in a restaurant. Sodium is not just in table salt. You can also find
 it in sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and monosodium
 glutamate (MSG). Asian foods often have MSG as well as soy sauce, which is also
 very salty. But with some planning and helpful tips, you can still enjoy eating
 out while limiting the sodium in your diet.

 Key points 

 Restaurant foods are usually high in
 sodium. Most restaurants are willing to prepare your food with less
 or no sodium, if you ask. Food can still taste good and be low in
 sodium. 
 What? What is a low-sodium diet? 
If you are on a
 low-sodium diet, you need to limit your intake of salt and other forms of
 sodium in the food you eat. Depending on your condition, your doctor will
 probably limit your sodium to less than 2,000 milligrams (mg) a day. This can
 be challenging for people who like to eat out, because processed foods,
 including restaurant food, are often the biggest source of sodium in our diets.
 
Test Your Knowledge
 
The biggest source of sodium in most people&apos;s diets is
 from adding salt to the food.

 True This answer is incorrect. 
Processed foods, including restaurant food, are
 often the biggest source of sodium in our diets.
 False This answer is correct. 
Processed foods, including restaurant food, are
 often the biggest source of sodium in our diets.
 
 
 Continue to Why? 
 Why? Why is it important to limit sodium when eating out? 
Sodium causes your body to hold extra water. This can make certain
 conditions, such as heart failure or kidney disease , worse. For example, if you have heart
 failure, too much sodium makes it harder for your already weakened heart to
 pump and can lead to sudden heart failure. Fluid may build up in your
 lungs—making it harder for you to breathe—and in your feet, ankles, legs, and
 belly. Limiting sodium in your diet will make you feel better.

 Continue to How? 
 How? How can you avoid sodium when eating out? 
It
 requires extra effort to avoid sodium when you eat out, because you can&apos;t
 always tell by looking at the menu which items are high in sodium. It often
 depends on how the restaurant prepares the meal, what ingredients they use, and
 how much sodium they add. Here are some ways to avoid sodium when you dine
 out.

 Try to choose restaurants where the food is
 made to order, instead of choosing fast-food or buffet-style restaurants.
 Before you order, ask how the food is prepared and if the restaurant offers
 low-sodium menu items. Often you can ask that your meal be prepared with no
 added sodium. Most fast-food restaurants have nutrition
 information available, including sodium content. If you do eat at a fast-food
 restaurant, ask for the nutrition information and choose lower-sodium
 items. Ethnic foods, such as Asian or Mexican, often have lots of
 sodium. You don&apos;t always have to give up these foods, but ask the server to
 help you make lower-sodium choices. When you eat out, try to eat
 very low-sodium items the rest of the day. This will help you stay within your
 sodium limit for the day. 

Learn what food items are okay and which ones to avoid. For
 example, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce has more than 1,000 mg of sodium, and 1
 teaspoon of salt has about 2,000 mg of sodium. You can use the following list
 and bring it with you to the restaurant. You may be able to substitute low-salt
 or fresh menu items for those with higher sodium content.
