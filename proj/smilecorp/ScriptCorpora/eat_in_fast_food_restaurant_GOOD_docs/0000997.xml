Technology Vs Customer Service

 By Rob Anspach 
 
That virus wiped me out!

Actually, wiped my computer out!

Last week I shared with with you that my computer was a victim of a trojan virus...and it was a nasty one at that. It infected numerous systems, knocking out my internet, printer and the ability to turn back the clock and reset the restore functions.

It was a mind-numbing, physically exhaustive process that cost me time, energy and money to fix.

Well, thank goodness for technicians who show up on Sunday to fix things. Well, it ended up taking 5 hours to restore my computer to better than before condition.

The only caveat is that I lost all of my emails. I&apos;m sure they are in some lost quadrant of the computers deepest recesses...frankly, I&apos;m not too concerned, well not until someone calls me and asks if I read their email. Then the whole panic thing might just set in.

The whole situation got me really thinking. This stuff happens all the time! Not to me personally, but to lots of businesses. Some handle the situation very well, yet others panic and pull their hair out, scream and stomp, yell, and basically make life miserable for others.

We as a society rely very heavily on computers, cell phones, credit card processing machines and automatic teller machines (ATM&apos;s). So much so, that we curse the moment this devices leave us hanging, and don&apos;t do what they are supposed to.

I was frequenting my favorite hardware store over the weekend and they not only were having employee issues (a story for another time), their computer network was down and so nobody knew how to hand process orders. They had relied so much on computer technology that nobody knew how to physically write up an order. The store was at the mercy of the network. Thousands of dollars in potential sales out the window, because nobody had the mindset to change the rules.

&quot;I apologize Mr. Jones for the computer problems today, but if you bear with me I will write up your order and if you wish to pay with a credit card I will process it when the system comes back up.&quot;

But, noooooo! We would rather tell the customer to come back later or worse drive them into the arms of our competition.

Then I stopped at a fast food restaurant (yeah, I know I shouldn&apos;t eat the crap, but needed something desperately to eat), and their credit card machine was down. So again, they were losing sales in droves...and sadly they decided not to tell anybody when they came in about the credit card problem, until they tried to order. Then the look on customer faces as they quickly realized how much standing in line ready to order was quickly turned to disappointment. The people in their cars were less than amused when they became captives in the drive through.

Technology is wonderful and it can complement our lives, yet it also has the tendency of making us too dependent and non thinking (especially towards our customers).

Customers don&apos;t mind a few minor problems, if you&apos;re sincere and honest with them.
