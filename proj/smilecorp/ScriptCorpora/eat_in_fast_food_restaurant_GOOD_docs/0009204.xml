Kimesa Smith was arrested on a misdemeanor battery charge after she had a violent meltdown over a Burger King meal
 
A bikini-clad mum sparked a riot at Burger King restaurant after she was unhappy with the service at the fast food restaurant.


Kimesia Smith leapt up on the counter and threw a three gallon charity jug at terrified staff.


Her friends in the restaurant joined in the fracas as they tossed napkins, plastic utensils and trays at staff.


Smith&apos;s rage was captured on cell phone video at the Burger King restaurant in Panama City Beach, Florida.


The mother-of-two was visiting the popular tourist resort with friends when she became agitated while waiting for her order.


Smith can be heard on the film berating staff behind the counter before storming over to a staff entrance and confronting servers.


Managers prevented her from gaining access to the kitchen and a shoving match follows as Smith tries to gain access to where the food is being prepared.


Cheered on by her friends, Smith jumped up on the counter and tossed a charity coin jug at staff.
 
Kimesia Smith is seen leaping onto the counter of the Burger King, grabbing a jug containing charity donations, right, and hurling it, and other items, at an employee

 
Managers called police but not before napkins, and utensils were hurled around the restaurant.

 
Smith, from Montgomery, Alabama, was arrested by police and charged with simple battery after she allegedly pulled an employee&apos;s hair.


She was held overnight in jail and is due in court to face the battery charge following the near riot on Tuesday night.


According to a Panama City Beach Police Department report, Smith tried to pull away after being handcuffed.

She shouted at the officer: &apos;Take your damn hands off me, you can’t touch me.&apos;

While in custody, she &apos;continued screaming and yelling&apos; at a policeman and a Burger King employee who identified her for officers.

It is not known where her children were at the time.


A restaurant manager said the eatery suffered minor damage during the incident, but that no worker was injured.

It&apos;s a shame to act that but nobody knows waht kind of day that women had. Whether right or wrong she felt justified to do what did. Just like closed minded people that still blame the Pres. for there own short comings or call people animals. When will people stop looking at the world in black and white and see right or wrong! Come on people wake up! To the person that called the lady an animal&quot;your thoughts are just as bad as her behavior, you must Love Christ first before you can his creation&quot;.

Just look at that mug shot! What a piece of trash. In turn, her mother must have been a piece of work too. It&apos;s only gonna get worse. We&apos;re not allowed to say she did this because she&apos;s a piece of ghetto trash, that would be racist, we can only say tsk, tsk and sweep it under the rug. This woman should lose her children and not be allowed to procreate again! It makes me sick.

But come on. This making headlines? There is so many serious issues than a bikini woman creating a scene in a restaurant. Its even simple battery. I am not saying she did nothing wrong, but its just a bunch of stupid girls who really dont deserve to take any of our time. She wont even serve time, so why are we wasting time? Giving her a 15 minutes of shame? She obviously love it, because the consequences wont be that bad.

Welfare animal that Obama continue to support by taxing the rest of us hard-working, law-abiding Americans. When will the liberals realize that we now have a class of lawless animals thanks to their Nanny State? 
- Byron Chan 
Where exactly in this article did it mention that she is on welfare? Why is President Obama being blamed for a welfare system that has been around for decades? Because the perpertrator is a black woman, she&apos;s automatically on welfare? Sad response, Byron

She looks like an animal at the zoo. I hope they wiped their counters down with bleach after they dragged her away!

If you look at the mug shot you will see the dull look of an ignorant, violent person who has an undeserved sense of entitlement. She and others who engage in this kind of animalistic behavior have very little intelligence and frequently enjoy benefit as opposed to working for a living. Put her in jail and keep her there until she gets the message.

What the hell has gotten into SOME people lately. Calling this individual an animal is an insult to animals. 
Contrast this behavior with that of the Japanese people who have suffered so much -- without looting, rioting, screeching like banshees.
