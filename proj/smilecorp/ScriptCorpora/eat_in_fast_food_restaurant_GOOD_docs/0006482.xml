 EVENING HOURS; Ever Air-Kiss A Dinosaur 
 BY BILL CUNNINGHAM Nov. 29: The Food Allergy Initiative raised more than $2 million for its programs, with a dinner for 700 guests at the Plaza. The organization supports research to find a cure for severe food allergies. December 3, 2000 
 The Allergy Prison 
 Our children are being vaccinated more than ever today. I think it is time we investigate a possible connection between food allergies, autoimmune diseases and vaccinations. Carol Richards New York July 1, 2001 
 
 
 A Menace, Be It Smooth or Chunky; Not Supporting Ban 
 To the Editor: A Sept. 23 front-page article implies that the Food Allergy Network supports the campaign to ban peanut butter in schools. The network&apos;s position is to support education and awareness in school systems as a way to manage food-allergic students. We are not in favor of banning any food. Bans are impossible to implement unless the school provides all of the food for all of the students. If that is not the case, all parents would have to read food labels and promise not to allow their children to bring in foods containing peanuts. September 28, 1998 
 Introduction 
 The cover article on severe food allergies extracted dozens of war stories from parents who are continuously battling &quot;wholesome poisons. &quot; Other readers parsed our profile of Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut senator with presidential aspirations, for signs of anti-Semitism.

 HEALTH; Program Aims to Promote Food Allergy Awareness 
 BY MERRI ROSENBERG WHEN Brenda Resnick Spano, the county executive&apos;s wife, made a trip to the Westchester Medical Center emergency room recently after she ate something that set off a serious allergic response, she personified the plight of some four million Americans whose life-threatening food allergies can make dining out a risky venture. &quot;Millions of people have food allergies,&quot; said the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, at Sam&apos;s of Gedney Way, a restaurant here, as he introduced a new initiative at the end of October to raise awareness of this issue for the county&apos;s food... November 4, 2001 
 On Allergies 
 To the Editor: I read &quot;Coping With Food Allergies,&quot; by Susan Catto with great interest. The article was well documented and informative. I have a specific concern related to diet. Twenty-some years ago, I experienced my first kidney stone attack. The stone was analyzed as calcium oxalate in content. After research, I discovered that innocent looking parsley was off the Richter scale in oxalates. Waiters and chefs often forget a request for no parsley in my food or on my plate.

 Food Allergy Called Unseen Asthma Villain 
 BY JANE E. BRODY COULD food allergies contribute to asthma attacks? Allergies to inhaled substances like pollen, molds, dust mites and animal dander often touch off asthma attacks in susceptible people. Now, a new study has linked food allergies to the respiratory difficulties that underlie asthma. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Children&apos;s Center in Baltimore have reported that some children with asthma who are also allergic to one or more foods may fail to respond well to asthma treatment unless they avoid the foods they react to. The study, which examined the responses of 26 children... February 21, 1996 
 Can Bioengineers Feed the Planet? 
 To the Editor: Your July 20 front-page article on genetically engineered food ignores a major reason why Consumers Union and others seek labeling of such food: to address the problem of food allergies. When genes are moved from one species to another, allergens may be moved as well. Potentially life-threatening food allergies affect some 2 percent of adults and up to 8 percent of children. A study in The New England Journal of Medicine in March 1996 confirmed that life-threatening allergens had been unknowingly transferred from Brazil nuts into a soybean when genes were introduced to improve the...

 Corrections 
 A chart in Science Times on Tuesday with the Personal Health column, about nuts, misstated the allergenic risk of nut oils. Most nut oil refined in the United States is free of protein, the allergen in nuts, and therefore does not cause problems for people with nut allergies. But oil extracted by certain methods, like the cold-pressed process, may still contain protein and can indeed pose a risk. Information is available from the Food Allergy Network at www .foodallergy.org or (703) February 10, 2000 
 National Briefing | Washington: Canned Soup Recall 
 Campbell Soup has recalled about 56,000 pounds of canned soup that contained cheese that could cause reactions for those with food allergies, the Agriculture Department said. The cans are labeled &quot;Campbell&apos;s Select, Ready to Serve Soup, Italian Sausage with Pasta and Pepperoni, New. &quot; The soup was distributed to Costco stores in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington.

 LOVE AND RESENTMENT 
 As a mother, I was deeply moved by the anguished ambivalence of Barbara Bick. As a registered nurse, I wonder if Ms. Bick is aware of the role that food allergies and hypoglycemia may play in her daughter&apos;s condition (mental illness, &quot;perpetual headaches and frequent stomachaches&quot; and Crohn&apos;s disease). Constant coffee drinking and incessant smoking often are symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. I know of many people who have had great &quot;mental&quot; improvement when they adhered to a hypoglycemic diet for an extended period of time. April 22, 1990 
 User-Friendly Food Labels 
 People who are allergic to milk products know they should check the ingredients of packaged foods in the grocery store. But not all of them know, for example, that &quot;whey&quot; is a synonym for milk, and the food industry is not required to describe ingredients in everyday English -- even though 30,000 people are rushed every year to emergency rooms because of food allergies. That could change if Congress passes a clear-language bill now before the Senate&apos;s Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. July 16, 2002 
 
 
 Avoiding Food Allergens 
 To the Editor: &quot;F.D.A. Survey Finds Faulty Listings of Possible Food Allergens&quot; (Business Day, April 3): Last May, I, along with eight other state attorneys general, petitioned the Food and Drug Administration for mandatory, comprehensive food product labeling and the institution of procedures to ensure against cross-contamination. The agency has responded only by noting where the issue is on its priorities list. Product-labeling regulations are also deficient in not requiring identification of genetically modified ingredients.
