​ Enough of the Taco Bell love of last week--back to our regularly scheduled column examining the strangest crimes in the past week involving Taco Bell. This one&apos;s a doozy from the Great White North or whatever the hell they call Alaska...

 Three tacos cost a Fairbanks man $100 in fines, one day in jail and one year probation.

Warren
E. Strickland, 31, of Fairbanks, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct
Tuesday for throwing a double-decker taco at a manager of the Taco Bell
restaurant on University Avenue.

 Strickland said he was upset
during the Jan. 14 incident because a taco contained spit after he had
been through the drive-thru twice to correct his order.

According
to a criminal complaint filed in court, he went into the restaurant and
threw the taco at manager Carol Dzimtrowicz, who said it hit her in the
face and that she was scared of Strickland. Another employee reported
that Strickland threatened to knock him out.

Strickland was arrested at his home driveway, where he admitted throwing the taco, according to the complaint.

I guess you have to be a police officer in order for justice to be handed down.
 
throwing a taco at the manager. that sounds hilarious to me.
 
Wow, Taco Bell needs to seriously do some image management. I haven&apos;t eaten there for years because of all the bad food rumors that go around. Whether true or not, I wouldn&apos;t take my chances.
 
Interesting that if indeed the taco did contain human saliva, no one from the&quot;restaurant&quot;was ever charged with felony charges.
 
Something should have happened to the workers at Tacobell. They&apos;re lucky people are still purchasing food from their franchise after that onion issue they had a few years back now.
 
How the heck are we to know if his food was spit on or not. Furthermore, why would I believe this idiots word? Clearly he is not all stable if he is going to throw food at someone, no matter what the reason. And exactly what &apos;Felony&apos; charges can be brought upon from spitting in food.

Did anyone of you fastidious grouping card e&apos;er formerly discuss that this guy power be a paranoid a - muddle and maybe his content did NOT hold pin? How the heck are we to undergo if his content was ptyalize on or not. Moreover, why would I conceive this idiots evince? Clearly he is not all stabile if he is deed to fuddle matter at someone, no matter what the conclude. And just what &apos;Felony&apos; charges can be brought upon from expectoration in matter? I ungenerous, a felony? Similar, I am doing 10 - 20 for felony matter expectoration? Are you intellectual? The Yankee governing defines a felony as a crime illegal by ending or confinement in redundant of one year. If punishable by just one twelvemonth or fewer, it is sorted as a offence.
 
I should get everything that I want on a taco if I&apos;m paying for it.One have to realize that the customers pay for part of your paycheck at the fast food restaurant you work for.
 
really u guys
 
Did anyone of you nice people posting ever once consider that this guy might be a paranoid a - hole and maybe his food did NOT contain spit? How the heck are we to know if his food was spit on or not. Furthermore, why would I believe this idiots word? Clearly he is not all stable if he is going to throw food at someone, no matter what the reason. And exactly what &apos;Felony&apos; charges can be brought upon from spitting in food? I mean, a felony? Like, I am doing 10 - 20 for felony food spitting? Are you serious? The Federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor.
 
haha. first off, i don&apos;t work at fast food. second, i never said he shouldn&apos;t get his cheese and i never said someone should spit in his taco. all i&apos;m saying is the guy probably threw a bitch fit and was acting like a child. over what i&apos;d be willing to bet was a simple mistake. listen up internet, having your order messed up at a fast food restaurant is NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. when i eat at a fast food place i know damn well that i get what i pay for. if its fucked up its because the person making my 99 cent food items is being paid minimum wage. so if i want eat somewhere that i have the right to be upset if my food order is botched then i will go else where.


i&apos;m imagining it now. some where in bob&apos;s head there is a bubble with the gentleman politly walking back to the counter and saying, &apos;excuse me sir, i do believe you forgot my cheese, could i have it corrected please?&apos; and the guy walking in the back &apos;jesus fucking christ, fuck this fucking guy *spit*&apos;

haha.
 
Doug are you serious? I should get everything that I want on a taco if I&apos;m paying for it. No matter how cheap it is. You have to realize that the customers pay for part of your paycheck at the fast food restaurant you work for. There was no reason for them to spit in someones food even if they throw a bitch fit.
 
i love people like this&quot;First they cant figure out how to put together a freaking taco,then when asked to correct it they spit in the food?&quot;you can all tell people who have never had to work retail/sales. that person had probably already made 50 tacos that day and out of those 50 tacos they forgot that some guy didn&apos;t want cheese on his taco. i would bet you anything that the kind of guy that would throw a taco in someones face didn&apos;t politely ask or even just ask to have it corrected. he probably threw a bitch fit and acted like a massive piece of shit because god forbid that his $1.29 taco have something that he didn&apos;t want on it. also if someone came into your work and threw something in your face there is a slight chance that you might be a little scared too.
 
Yo let me get my taco for .89 cents ya heard.
 
Yeah, but did he get his liter cola?
 
I don&apos;t know about you guys, but this is a waist of a taco. Lmao

Honestly, something should have happened to the workers at Tacobell. They&apos;re lucky people are still purchasing food from their franchise after that onion issue they had a few years back now. Remember that?
 
I kind of agree with the taco thrower! Spit in the taco?
and no repercussions for the employees?

Probably just because the female employee said she was&quot;scared&quot;of the customer. Pathetic misuse of her femaleness to take advantage of the law.
and yes I am a woman.

First they cant figure out how to put together a freaking taco,then when asked to correct it they spit in the food?
 
Spit in the taco deserves foot in the arse
 
I would have done the same thing. Spit in my taco, and you&apos;re going to wear it.
 
&quot;No Taco, no case&quot;Words to live by.
 
Interesting that if indeed the taco did contain human saliva, no one from the&quot;restaurant&quot;was ever charged with felony charges.

This happened in ABQ a couple years ago at a BK and the employee that spit in the cop&apos;s burger was arrested and charged with assault.

Guess you have to be a police officer in order for justice to be handed down.

But then again, once the taco was tossed, all evidence was promptly thrown to the floor. No taco, no case.
 
&apos;Great White North&apos; is Alaska? You&apos;re a dumbass, that is Canada, not Alaska.

Alaska is the &apos;Last Frontier&apos;.
