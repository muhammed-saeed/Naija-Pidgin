How Much Have I Had to Drink?
 
For the past few years I&apos;ve been keeping a meticulous record of ever bar I have visited. While I have been listing them by name here, several people have mentioned that my list would be more useful if it had more information.

To that end I present my new dynamic bar list. Just click the &quot;details&quot; link next to any bar listed to see a photo, map, address, phone number, details, my ratings, and in many cases a summary of my visit.

To count as a bar the establishment must serve alcohol and have an actual bar with bar stools. In addition, for me to count it, I must consume an alcoholic drink in the actual bar area, go there specifically with the purpose of having a drink, and I cannot have my drink with a meal. (Bar appetizers are ok.) I also do not count cash bars at private functions. There are actually several bars I have been to that I cannot add to my list yet because I have not met these requirements.

The ratings I give each of the bars below are based on a combination of factors in my personal experience there. For instance an otherwise nice bar might get a lower rating from me if the bartender was rude; likewise a crappy bar might get a higher rating if the bartender was particularly friendly or helpful.

I&apos;ll continue to add to this list as I visit more places in the future.
