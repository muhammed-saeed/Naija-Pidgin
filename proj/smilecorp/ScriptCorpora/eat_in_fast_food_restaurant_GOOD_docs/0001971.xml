 Great first experience , 4/17/2012
Reviewer: Jeff

My first visit. Was favorably impressed. Had the Lamb Vindaloo and it was GREAT. All of the people in my party commented on the good food. Service was attentive but not suffocating. This is a good place that I will go back to. Recommended.

 yummy lunch specials , 4/6/2012
Reviewer: lemonjelly
 from santa barbara, ca
The basic lunches are a main curry, rice, lentils and naan, with five vegetarian choices ($9), and four each of chicken ($10), lamb ($11), and fish ($13). Served in a tray that seems part thali, and part bento, with compartments. For lunch, it&apos;s pretty simple, and a good price. The greater variety of curries are available a la carte.
There&apos;re three additional vegetarian lunch specials that&apos;s a chickpea curry (chole or chana), and deep fried breads or samosas, those are each $9. I got the chana and samosa option and really liked it. The chana was a good balance of spicy, spiceful, and the portion was decent - I had to take home some of it. And I love samosas. I wish they came with a little bit of sweet mango chutney. It&apos;s okay, I ate them with the raita and mint chutney from the chutney bar.
The weekend dosa special looks great too, like a weekend brunch prix fixe that included dessert.
There is supposed to be rotating recipes for the dal, which is pretty cool. Nothing like the variety available in India, I am sure, but it&apos;s nice to know there&apos;s some variety to the side dishes in the lunch specials.
Ambiance: stripmall style (unfortunately). BUT there&apos;re two televisions showing Bollywood films to keep you occupied from watching the soul-sucked KFC diners trundling by next door with their buckets.
Timid eaters: try the butter chicken.

Why don&apos;t the Indian restaurants in town stop 
trashing each other and focus on your own food

 Generic Indian Food That&apos;s Too Expensive , 3/8/2012
Reviewer: Nancy
 from Santa Barbara, CA
India Club looks like a fast food restaurant to be rather pricey. Why is this food and service worth the price...it isn&apos;t. It took forever to get our drinks and everything else too more than forever. The wrong entree was served to me and I worried it would take forever to get the right dish. At least that was something that was done quickly. The food was all right if one doesn&apos;t know a lot about Indian food. It was very generic and not even that great for generic Indian. I can go to Flavor of India and get wonderful food, great service and pay less. At least the Dosa Festival on weekends is nice. Maybe they should serve Southern Indian food only.

 Great modified fast-food , 3/8/2012
Reviewer: patrick m
 from Santa Barbara, CA
We ate dinner here and we really liked the food. This is basically a glorified fast food restaurant, at which you order at a counter, get a number and sit down, then your food is brought to you. When ordering, we were a little disappointed at the limited selection. I also was surprised when told they were out of sweet lassi -- I thought &apos;why not mix up some more?&apos;. We took our number and sat down. When the food came, it was great -- really delicious. When my wife&apos;s mango lassi came, it was in a plastic cup with a sealed plastic film top that appeared to have Chinese writing on it. That solved the mystery of their running out of sweet lassi: it appears the lassi are pre-made in a factory. Overall , the food was delicious, the modified fast food setup was disappointing (we&apos;d prefer a real restaurant with waitstaff), and therefore the price a little high for this meal. We&apos;ll probably come back, but not as often as we would if it were a bonafide sit-down restaurant. On the plus side -- we did eat with real utensils and dishes instead of throwaway ones.

 Great Indian Food - in comfortable setting , 1/22/2012
Reviewer: kfresh
 from Santa Barbara, CA
6 friends came here and we had a great experience - the kitchen was a little rushed so our stuff came out at different times-but we forgot about that as we feasted on great Indian food! Everything we had - except the special south indian fish dish was great: Lamb kebob, Biryani, chicken tikka masala, special lamb dish, navattam korma. Also special nod to the cauliflower appetizer - super yummy.

 BAD value for the food , 1/20/2012
Reviewer: jimcaveez
 from Santa Barbara, CA
the food is way overpriced, menu variety is very poor. if you want more than one entree, a la carte prices are ridiculously high. you can get a full service waiter, free naan, drink refills etc. at an indian restaurant near downtown for the same as what you pay here. the food isnt even that good; often over-spiced (i love indian food from many locations, so its not that im not used to the flavors). service? there is none. and the workers are unfriendly when taking your order/money. prices befitting a nice restaurant, but service you get at a fast food joint in return. one of the worst values in town, imo.

 Very good food but no real table service or refills , 1/19/2012
Reviewer: Hugh
 from Santa Barbara, CA
This was my second time there. I really enjoyed the food; Chicken Korma today, the Masala last time. Dahl and rice included and good. Excellent naan I thought, very soft and fresh. Hmmm it was suspiciously like pita bread. I like it.
 They really need to let people know that there are Lunch Specials for only $9.95 and it includes Naan which dinners apparently do not. Perfect portion but we had to get our own napkins and silverware. Also the &quot;Free Chutney Bar&quot; had no chutney but raita, hot green relish, hot sauce, and tamarind sauce. The raita lacks much flavor or ingredients but is welcome nonetheless. I love Chutney and missed it but Flavor of India doesn&apos;t give you any either and it&apos;s not cheap. My dish did not require it at all anyways.
 My friend also bought Pakoras, you get two and he gave me one. Honestly the best I ever had, light, crunchy, and tasty. Good sized too, made the lunch quite filling.
 Major gripe is the soda by the can although you can serve yourself water near the door. You can pay a tip when you order at the counter; I always do, food service is tough and I appreciate it. They seemed to have added more tables which is good. They bring you your order fairly quickly and then you are on your own. I&apos;ve no problem with that really.
 Was a fair crowd at 12:30pm; 3/4 full. I will return and enjoy it. I hope they do well. 
 I don&apos;t mean by my low service rating that anything was lacking there is just no real service to rate like any counter ordered eatery. Everyone is very pleasant. The place is very clean. Try it!

 Quite Delicious! , 1/15/2012

 Will keep coming back , 1/8/2012
Reviewer: Kim
 from Santa Barbara, CA
We love Indian food and love to go to Artesia in L.A. We were to have a place in Goleta! And so excited to see Dosa and Uttapam on the menu on the weekends. We had a great meal today. Some reviews said they should just have a buffet. I disagree. The presentation was great with good size proportions. Some say it was pricey but I think it was reasonable and cheaper than if I went downtown or to L.A. It is comparable to Chinese food prices. They have a great extensive menu for ordering at the counter. I think it is a great addition to Calle Real. We&apos;ll be back on a regular basis. My son said, &quot;This is my new favorite restaurant!&quot;

 Great Food, friendly service , 1/6/2012
Reviewer: Eric
 from Santa Barbara, CA
I really enjoyed my Saag Paneer lunch combo (came with salad, rice, bread and lentils)

Unlike other reviewers I found their service very friendly. I actually asked the owner if they would have a buffet and he explained that it was unlikely as the quality drops in buffets as waste increases.

 My feeling about most buffets is they fill them with poor quality, fried, greasy crap (panda express) Too bad as I love the variety of Indian buffets. Taj was fantastic as is Flavor of India.

The food quality at India Club was top notch, I&apos;ll definitely go back.

 from Buellton
I agree Charlotte plus I miss Pick Up Stix which I thought was great. Since its similar owners as Naan and Spice which do well I think they will stick it out until people like them more/change things as needed(i.e. a buffet!). I don&apos;t like their business model.

 $$$$$$ , 1/5/2012
Reviewer: Charlotte
 from Santa Barbara, CA
Second time going to India Club..... I&apos;m sorry I know I&apos;ve said this before, but they seriously need to cave in and have a buffet, like at Spice (Mother restaurant) $10.95 for a terrific lunch buffet with all of my favorites and most of which is Vegetarian, which I am not but is very tasty and healthy. At India Club $14.00 for lunch.....limp salad, Raita, rice and entree (which my Tilka chicken was all way too mild sauce) and bread was $$! And it was served on a plastic tray by the grumpiest waiter ever!??? I will not be joining this club.

 Their dosas ARE vegan , 12/31/2011
Reviewer: Steve
 from Santa Barbara, CA
I&apos;m vegan and was concerned to see Carrie&apos;s review. I can totally understand her concern since the first time I queried them I got a kind of glib and suspect &quot;it&apos;s all vegan&quot; answer. So the next time I grilled the owner Sonny at some length and he gave me a comprehensive list of ingredients in the dosas and uttapams. They are indeed completely vegan (i.e. entirely plant-based), including the soup, sauces, and &quot;donut&quot; sides, except 1) the two variants on the dosa menu that explicitly list meat in the filling, and 2) skip the vermicelli dessert course, which uses milk, or ask him ahead of time to make it with water instead. On the regular (non-dosa) menu they have 5 or 6 vegan items, but I haven&apos;t tried those as they are the usual suspects at most Indian restaurants. The weekend lunch dosa menu is more special. However, don&apos;t miss the cauliflower appetizer on the main menu, which I&apos;ve never seen elsewhere and found to be awesomely tasty. Deep fried so not the healthiest but it makes your taste buds sit up and beg. :-) In sum, this place has lots of vegan choices and is a very tasty addition to our local vegan communities&apos; restaurant options.

 Agree with Owen , 12/13/2011
Reviewer: James
 from Santa Barbara, CA
I had more or less the same experience as another reviewer down below.

This is a take-out place with decent food and poor service that thinks it can charge restaurant prices.

Some positive points:
1) Location - if you live and Goleta you really need Indian food RIGHT NOW you can save some gas and time by going here, since there&apos;s nothing else with ~6 miles.
2) Food - It&apos;s served hot and it&apos;s Indian food.
3) Decent Interior.

Some negative points:
1) Price - for the portions, atmosphere, service, and utilities, spending $14 on one person for lunch is just ridiculous. Maybe they think everyone in Santa Barbara is old or retired (and they&apos;d be right).

2) Service - Cashier was not friendly and did not listen. When I go to get some Indian I want extremely spicy food (which I specifically asked for) and the cashier did not understand me, despite two attempts to drive the point home. Food was not spicy.

3) Food - Not a lot of choice here and the taste is nothing special. Lentils were sort of watery, naan was very flavorless, limp, and disappointing compared to what I&apos;m used to.

4) Portion - Skimpy. I like to do things with my life so I need a lot of energy, and I don&apos;t want to have to go next door afterwards for a smoothie to get this energy (especially after spending $14).

5) Tap Water - this is probably mostly a personal thing but they&apos;ve filled their water dispenser with tap water that tastes a lot like the inside of metal pipe. Had to pay $2 for a bloody CAN of coke.

I probably won&apos;t return here. At this point it&apos;s worth the time and effort to drive six miles to at LEAST get to Flavor of India (hell, I might even go to Naan Stop despite their pathetic food and even worse service, but at least I won&apos;t be ripped off). This restaurant is new and I would expect a bit more effort, but I&apos;m optimistic that they&apos;ll change in the future.

 Very attentive service; good food , 12/12/2011
Reviewer: Nancy

We went to India Club for their dosas. They were some of the best I have ever had. The service was very attentive and pleasant. Despite their higher price point for the neighborhood, we will return for great Indian food.

 Would try their food if they were ever open! , 11/22/2011
Reviewer: Nicole
 from Santa Barbara, CA
I drive by this place daily and I&apos;ve been eager to give them a chance, though I&apos;ve had little luck. During my first attempt, I strolled up at 4:30 pm and saw some people seated inside, so naturally I thought they were open for business - wrong. The door was locked, and the people inside simply waved me off. I looked at the posted hours and saw they wouldn&apos;t open for 30 minutes, so I wandered elsewhere for food. I went back yesterday at 6:00 pm since per their posted hours they should be open at that time on a Monday, but when I arrived the lights were off and nobody was home. FAIL. If you&apos;re going to run a business, I suggest being open during your advertised hours. Otherwise you&apos;ll just keep losing business to the closest open restaurant. Next time I&apos;m craving Indian food, I won&apos;t even bother with this place.

 Needs help , 11/17/2011
Reviewer: Owen
 from Santa Barbara, CA
I wanted to like this place. It&apos;s clean and attractively decorated, and we could use another good Indian restaurant. Sadly, they have some work to do. 


The staff is inexperienced and not friendly (not UNfriendly, but not friendly either, just kind of cold). The cashier didn&apos;t seem to know how to handle a cash purchase; it took forever and he seemed unnerved to the degree that we felt bad for him. 


There is a whole row of small tables, at least 30 percent of the total capacity of the place, that are permanently reserved for groups even though they are in no way suitable for a group (the tables are fastened to the floor and cannot be slid together). We were there at 5:00 on a weeknight and were the only people in the place, but they refused to let us sit at one of the reserved tables. Groups? Show me the groups already. Sheesh! And later a couple came in and sat at the reserved tables, taking up one table for each of them because they are really too small to accommodate two plates, drinks, etc. None of this made any sense.


There were no spoons at the chutney station, so I had to go get some in order to serve myself. And for the price of the food, one should expect table service, tablecloths, and maybe even a lighted candle. They&apos;re serving mediocre fast food in what is admittedly an upscale but still very fast food environment, at prices that are on par with other local Indian places that provide quality, interesting food and gracious table service. This is just not going to compete.


About the food: it was not all that interesting. It was fresh enough and certainly not bad, but it was nothing special either. The menu stated that the entrees would come with salad and raita, but they came with potatoes and lentils instead. If they change their food, they should change their menus at the same time. And really, we would have preferred the salad and raita because our meals were all carbohydrates with no refreshing relief of something fresh and alive. The lentils were mainly a thin bland gruel with few discernible lentils ecch. They did not ask about the level of spiciness, so it was too mild for me and too spicy for my mate. 


I hate to leave a negative review, and I do wish them well. But I hope they read this and realize they&apos;re not meeting the expectations of, well, at least us and the people next to us who were also complaining. Gotta do better, folks, if you want to be around for a while.

 Delicious food! , 11/14/2011

If you like Indian food, you must try this place. The flavors are fantastic! We are putting this place into our regular &quot;rotation&quot;.
This is Naan Stop in Isla Vista on steroids!

 No vegan dosa festival , 11/11/2011
Reviewer: Carrie 
 from Santa Barbara, CA
They seem to be a bit confused about how to use the word vegan. I was excited when I saw that they were advertising a special vegan festival at lunch on the weekends, but had to leave when it became obvious that they weren&apos;t clear &quot;vegan&quot; means no animal products whatsoever (it seems as though they think it means &quot;no milk&quot;). Vegans---don&apos;t rush over like I did! Would love it if they would do vegan lunch specials, though!! :)

 Wonderful Food. A must try. , 10/30/2011
Reviewer: Justin
 from Santa Barbara, CA
As with most Indian restaurants, there are very solemn young gentlemen serving. Not sure why they are all so emotionless, but anyhoo...place makes up for it in taste and quality. A bit pricey, but I think it&apos;s worth it. Been here twice now. Butter chicken is wonderful.

 Diwali 2011 , 10/27/2011
Reviewer: EatsALot
 from Santa Barbara, CA
I had some friends over for Diwali and ordered take out from here. The food was excellent. The portions were generous and unlike other places they gave rice, lentils and veggies with every order. This was great. To top it off, they gave me free sweets because it was Diwali. I am sold on this place for my weekly CTM fix.

 Pretty Good Food but pricey over a buffet , 10/19/2011
Reviewer: Glenn
 from Buellton
They have got Goletans by the somasas if they are craving Indian and dont want to drive towards SB. No buffet in the future(=long wait for food so call in), you can just get plates of things, naan bread is extra $. Same layout as Pickup Stix w/o soda fountain just canned soda(go to Blenders!) though they have Boba apparently(not a fan of Boba). I wish as a rule they would put utensils/napkins into to go orders, trying to save money I guess.
