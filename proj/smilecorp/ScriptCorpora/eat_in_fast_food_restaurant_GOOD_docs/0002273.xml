 curioustipper,

It depends on what restaurant you are talking about.

I know that in my area some restaurants have servers assigned to the take-out desk. They are paid less than minimum per hour($4.00/hr)simply because they get tipped.

Think about it...would you take a position that paid only $4.00/hr??

I don&apos;t know if this is the case for your situation...but just wanted to give you some insight on how some restaurants pay their employees...or should I say(don&apos;t pay their employees).

 Before I started bar tending at my job, where I make $6.00 an hour. I waited tables $2.85 an hour, part of the assigned duties are to do take out.
I never expected 20% on take out but a little love is nice depending on the size of the order, a buck or a couple of bucks is nice. If you go there regular to pick up take out I would definitely tip. That&apos;s when you get the extra crackers enough dressing and ketchup. Could be the difference between getting you order together as a priority or the no tipping so and so can wait. Just a suggestion though.

Maybe it&apos;s because you don&apos;t seem to have a clue. Maybe it&apos;s because he or she thinks that maybe you&apos;re doing pickup is to avoid tipping and so are willing to sit at home and eat your food out of plastic containers. Maybe it&apos;s because he or she thinks that you haven&apos;t thought about the fact that someone has to prepare your food and take time away from tipping guests. Maybe it&apos;s because he or she realizes that you haven&apos;t considered that to go people don&apos;t expect to receive a full tip as in full service but DO reasonably expect something for the time in taking your order over the phone and getting it correct, preparing the order for you to take out, double-checking to make sure that your order is correct and ringing you out.

In my restaurant, our to-go people even go so far as to unpack the order in front of the guest and go over each item with them, so they have to pack, unpack AND repack the order. They ring up between $1000 and $2500 during an average night shift. During the day, one of the bartenders have to take time away from their own guests to assure that the order gets fulfilled. I have no idea what kind of place that you&apos;re talking about, or what level of service that they provide, but the fact that you don&apos;t even give a token tip for someone who has provided a nice service for you speaks volumes, as does the fact that you have to ask about&quot;the look&quot;. Chances are, you are one of the few who doesn&apos;t&quot;get it&quot;, which is why you get&quot;the look&quot;. In my restaurant, you don&apos;t get&apos;the look&apos;, because our to-go people make a good living on the vast majority of people who tip something, and yes, there are a few people generous enough to actually tip the same as they would if they sat down, because they appreciate the personal(if different)service that they receive. For those who tip nothing, they just get mocked, especially if they order big or regularly. For the rest of the ones who order little piddly orders, well, they&apos;re just ignored. Of course, they aren&apos;t going to get any extra condiments, or even ANY preferential treatment, which those who are generous get everytime. If there are two people there to pick up at the same time, who do you think is going to get their food first if they&apos;re both ready? and believe me, during the rush, we have as many as 5 or 6 people waiting around to get their food.

So, continue to be a cheap-ass and suffer the look(it&apos;s free after all), or pony up a little love to the people who have made it possible to avoid a full tip and having to suffer sitting in the restaurant being waited on hand and foot.

&quot;taking your order over the phone and getting it correct, preparing the order for you to take out, double-checking to make sure that your order is correct and ringing you out.&quot;

ALL these things are done at Pizza places when a person goes to pick-up a pizza. I don&apos;t know too many people that would tip when they pick up a pizza. Also, if I call in an order at KFC, a huge one, they still have to get napkins, plastic utensils, ketchup or whatever condiments, ring a person up, they have to take down the order, and compare the food to that order. They WON&apos;T be getting a tip, so WHY should a person at a non-fast food type of restaurant get tipped for the SAME ACTIONS? I saw when I was getting a gift card at Chilis, a girl in front of me didn&apos;t tip at all for $17 or so worth of food. I&apos;m NOT suprised in the least. People go in to pick up the order, so there&apos;s NO service that isn&apos;t already paid in the wage per hour. If a person is getting the to-go meal car-side-to-go, then there is a service, it&apos;s called&quot;Bringing the food and/or drinks out to the customer.&quot;Filling drink cups are what fast food people do, even at Pizza Hut you can get a pepsi to-go.

Just as tricky said about Starbucks being the SAME actions. This is the SAME ACTIONS that are being done as fast food places do and pizza places.

You don&apos;t know too many people.

They WON&apos;T be getting a tip, so WHY should a person at a non-fast food type of restaurant get tipped for the SAME ACTIONS&quot;?

Because those people don&apos;t make $2.13 an hour. Because the prices at those places don&apos;t presume paying someone $2.13 an hour. Because those places don&apos;t displace full service when you order take out.

&quot;I saw when I was getting a gift card at Chilis, a girl in front of me didn&apos;t tip at all for $17 or so worth of food. I&apos;m NOT suprised in the least&quot;.

Why were you being a busybody? How did you find out in the first place?

&quot;People go in to pick up the order, so there&apos;s NO service that isn&apos;t already paid in the wage per hour&apos;.

That&apos;s not true. first of all, how do you know how much that person makes? I know that our to-go people make EXACTLY what a floor server makes. Tell you what will happen if everyone is as cheap and shortsighted as you. The restaurants will start instituting a service charge for you to come in and take out their food. Pizza delivery is already doing that in a lot of cases.

&quot;Just as tricky said about Starbucks being the SAME actions. This is the SAME ACTIONS that are being done as fast food places do and pizza places&quot;.

Yet, in most places, the people aren&apos;t being PAID THE SAME as fast food places. Restaurants offer this service for YOUR convenience and you should PAY for that service. Perhaps you would like for restaurants to simply not offer the service anymore, because it IS a service and they aren&apos;t going to be able to offer it at the same price if the to-go people can&apos;t make a living. One of two things will happen - they will either have a to-go menu with higher prices to reflect the addtional cost of paying their to-go people, or they&apos;ll offer a pickup surcharge.

I&apos;m not saying that you have to pay the same amount as when you dine in the restaurant, although some people do. From talking to my to-go people, about 70-80% iof people leave at least 7-10%, and about 5% actually leave a full 15%. That leaves about 10 -15% of people who don&apos;t care enough to tip the people who make it possible for them to eat the restaurant&apos;s food in the privacy of their own home. that&apos;s a pretty small proportion of people.

To go people in places like Chilis handle a very high volume of orders. It&apos;s a completely different type and level of service involved. They are juggling as many as 10 separate orders at one time. They are required to assure that the order is 100% correct, because they don&apos;t have a second chance to correct a mistake. This in itself moves the service bar much higher.

 I know some places at a 10% charge to all to go orders. Two places I used to work at both did that. The server got the charge plus any other tip left by the person. A few times people would complain, but it was posted on the door into the place, on the menu and when the order was taken on the phone. Oh, and, yes, these were chain restaurants.

 Who calls in an order at KFC???? I&apos;ve called to let them know when I was treating my kitchen hard working souls that they are to snackers that I would be by to pick up 20 of them so that they would know and would be prepared. I also always always always would bring them food from our restaurant AND tip them but that was just common manners! And a lot of the employees also were friends and came into the restaurant and ate. So giving the people that prepared the food an extra $10 on top of the food was just out of respect because I know how hard they work too. NO tipping them was not required... but they deserved it!
To go orders are a pain in the behind for everyone at the restaurant but the person taking the order and bringing it to you and making sure that everything is right deserves the same respect as you sitting down and dinning in. But not a lot of people understand that.
As for tipping on a pizza... Yeah I do that too... although now I work at a place that makes the best on earth so I always ask for my pizza to be made at the cooks convience and let them know hours ahead of time... I always do something for them personally... pack of smokes I leave on the pizza table... 6 pack with their name on it in the cooler.... I guess I just tip everyone. Karma!!!!!

I said:&quot;I saw when I was getting a gift card at Chilis, a girl in front of me didn&apos;t tip at all for $17 or so worth of food. I&apos;m NOT suprised in the least.&quot;

You said:&quot;Why were you being a busybody? How did you find out in the first place?&quot;

I was waiting on the side of her to get the&quot;Free $5 off coupon card when you buy a $25 gift card&quot;from Chili&apos;s. They didn&apos;t have ANY at the register because that was the first day they had the promotion on the internet, so the manager had to go into the back to get them, meanwhile, I had to stand for 5 minutes or longer to wait to be rung up because the to-go cashier had never even heard about this, so she didn&apos;t know if to ring it up yet or to wait, so she just waited until the manager went and found the $5 coupon cards. Anyway, I saw the girl that had like $17 worth of food pay with a $20 dollar bill and she put EVERY LAST CENT in her purse. She DIDN&apos;T leave a tip at ALL. I&apos;m NOT suprised. There&apos;s NO MORE SERVICE than a fast food employee(excluding Sonic), NO TIP is what the person deserves. The service is the EXACT SAME as a fast food employee(excluding Sonic). I had to do those things for call-in orders and for drive-thru at the donut shop. I DIDN&apos;T get tipped for drive-thru or a call-in order for doing those type of things. I had to put napkins, utensils, and condiments like ketchup or jellies. I had to ring them up. Also, if they have any drinks, fast food employees fill to-go cups as well as restaurants that have food to-go that are not fast food. Sometimes I&apos;d take the call-in order, sometimes someone else would in the back.

&quot;Because those people don&apos;t make $2.13 an hour. Because the prices at those places don&apos;t presume paying someone $2.13 an hour.&quot;

That still isn&apos;t FAIR to the workers that make more money not to get tipped for the SAME EXACT ACTIONS. WHY should it matter to the CUSTOMER&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;a person makes? I could care LESS. It&apos;s NOT my concern, the SERVICE is and when it&apos;s the EXACT SAME service I can get at a fast food place, I&apos;m NOT going to tip, plain and simple no matter HOW MUCH they make. If those employees were tipped, then I&apos;d treat a to-go employee the same that they too WOULD be tipped. Since they aren&apos;t, I&apos;m NOT going to treat people UNFAIRLY. That&apos;s just NOT RIGHT.

&quot;Because those places don&apos;t displace full service when you order take out.&quot;

That DOESN&apos;T mean the SERVICE ITSELF is worth ANYMORE. The customer that is getting something to-go is ONLY seeing what&quot;THEY&quot;are getting, NOT if it makes the full service of other customers not as good. Do you really think people are worried about the other customers in the restaurant when they are just picking up something to-go? I don&apos;t think so.

&quot;You should PAY for that service. Perhaps you would like for restaurants to simply not offer the service anymore, because it IS a service.&quot;

It&apos;s NOT a service because it is the SAME thing a fast food employee does to get a to-go order ready. If I ordered 50 pieces of chicken with 3 sides of mashed potatoes, 3 baked beans sides, and 3 orders of potato wedges, those employees aren&apos;t going to be able to get tipped. I KNOW, because my mom tried to tip a McDonald&apos;s employee one time because she likes her coffee weak, so she asks to have a little hot water in her cup, which is MORE trouble for the worker. The McDonald&apos;s employee said that she COULDN&apos;T accept tips, that she WASN&apos;T allowed to.

My point is, at KFC, the employee would have to package these items, put serveral utensils, ketchups, and napkins into the bags. They may even have to get salt and pepper packets also. They also may even want 10 drinks to fill perhaps. They&apos;d have to ring it up and give change if it&apos;s a cash purchase or if it&apos;s a credit card purchase, they would get a pen for the customer to sign the credit card receipt. They also had to take the order over the phone initially. ALL those things for NO TIP, so WHAT&apos;S the DIFFERENCE in service there, than at a to-go section at a restaurant?

&quot;They are juggling as many as 10 separate orders at one time.&quot;

Fast food places have that TOO when it&apos;s busy. You should see here in New Orleans because of the Katrina how the drive-thru lines are out to the street because of not enough employees to work inside. So think about how they are with ALL those orders. A lady at work told me she waited at&quot;Arby&apos;s&quot;for 25-30 minutes in the drive-thru line and her food was cold by the time she got it. Anyway, my point is, they have LOTS of orders TOO. So, this point of you saying that they have&quot;10 separate orders at one time&quot;doesn&apos;t mean a damn thing. It&apos;s just as busy over here for NO TIPS.

&quot;They are required to assure that the order is 100% correct, because they don&apos;t have a second chance to correct a mistake.&quot;

This is a flat out LIE. The to-go employee can open up the box to make sure EVERYTHING is in it BEFORE ringing it up and handing it to the customer. EVERYONE DOES have a SECOND CHANCE, it&apos;s called&quot;CHECKING OVER YOUR WORK.&quot;I had a second chance when I just handed people wrong donut boxes before. That was MY fault, but I COULD HAVE&quot;CHECKED OVER MY WORK&quot;, but I DIDN&apos;T. In turn, I rushed, so I got it WRONG sometimes. Comparing the box of food with the to-go order that is written down is what should be happening BEFORE ringing up the credit card or getting the cash to put into the register and handing the food to the customer.

I said:&quot;People go in to pick up the order, so there&apos;s NO service that isn&apos;t already paid in the wage per hour.&quot;

You said:&quot;That&apos;s not true. first of all.&quot;

It IS TRUE. When a person makes the $2.13/hr, that&apos;s the WAGE that the work covers, which is the EXACT SAME ACTIONS that the fast food employees do. It SHOULDN&apos;T be on the customer to pay the rest of the wages for NO MORE service than a fast food employees do. If it&apos;s the SAME ACTIONS, what is so different that someone should tip a to-go employee, but not to tip a fast food worker?

&quot;How do you know how much that person makes?&quot;

WHO CARES? That has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with service, NOTHING! It&apos;s what the customer encounters like if I get car-side-to-go or if I go to Sonic, those people ARE doing a service, which is taking my food to me and bringing back change or the credit card with the credit card receipt. THAT&apos;S SERVICE! I HAVE tipped at Sonic before for instance. They are taking the food and/or drink to me, so I tipped, even though those people probably get at least minimum wage. Sure the tip may not be too high because it is fast food, but since they take it to me, they get tipped, unless the order is wrong, then NO tip is deserved for taking it to me wrong or overcharging me.

Going inside to pick the food up is NO MORE service than a fast food(excluding Sonic)employee does. You KNOW that&apos;s the TRUTH!

&quot;One of two things will happen - they will either have a to-go menu with higher prices.&quot;

To be honest, I&apos;d RATHER have higher prices, than to give a tip to someone that just doesn&apos;t DESERVE it. If you do a SERVICE that is MORE than a fast food employee does(excluding Sonic), I will tip, plain and simple.

I said:&quot;ALL these things are done at Pizza places when a person goes to pick-up a pizza. I don&apos;t know too many people that would tip when they pick up a pizza&quot;.

You said&quot;You don&apos;t know too many people.&quot;

I know enough people that say they DON&apos;T pay a tip when they pick up a pizza. That&apos;s even LESS WORK to hand someone than to get utensils and condiments. That&apos;s even MORE NOT tip worthy to tip for a pizza that is not delivered. I&apos;ve heard if the person orders a HUGE order, then they would tip, but not just for one pizza, be real. WHY bother using&quot;YOUR OWN&quot;gas and wear and tear if you are going to tip ANYWAY? Even when the lady at Dominos called me about the situation I posted about several months ago about the $0.04 overcharge because the guy rounded everything to a penny because of my competitior&apos;s coupon, said something about that when you pick it up that you don&apos;t have to tip. Something like that basically, can&apos;t remember the exact wording, but she basically admitted that most people DON&apos;T tip for picking up a pizza. I asked my friend if she tipped for a pizza when she picks it up. Her response was&quot;SH@# NO!&quot;I don&apos;t know too many people that do.

Same thing with some of the people on here that don&apos;t like tip cups at donut shops. Sure, I appreciated the tips, but, I DIDN&apos;T expect them for doing the SAME THINGS that fast food employees do. Sometimes on a busy Sunday morning, they&apos;d have customers that would buy a dozen, which back during 1998, the dozen was only $4.00, anyway, they&apos;d pay with a $5 and put the $1 in the tip jar, just for a dozen donuts. I DON&apos;T think I deserved it just for one dozen donuts, but they did it anyway. Same service through drive-thru, but VERY little did I EVER receive a tip from drive-thru for the SAME service. Strange, but TRUE. Also, people would have orders that were big in drive-thru and my boss wanted us to ask if the person could move up because sometimes the line was out to the street, so he wanted the line to move if the first person had a huge order, but the second person only had a cup of coffee and a donut, it wasn&apos;t fair for the second person to sit there longer. I would do just like Sonic and take it to the customer, but the difference is, they already paid. I didn&apos;t get tipped for it though, not that I should have, just saying I didn&apos;t. I don&apos;t think I deserved to get tipped for it, especially when I&apos;m the one that asked the person to move up, boss&apos;s orders.

&quot;Take time away from tipping guests.&quot;

A non-tipping guest that is getting a to-go order is JUST as IMPORTANT as the tipping guest, otherwise you are being PREJUDICED against the non-tippers that are getting food to-go. Treat people as EQUALS whether they tip or not. That&apos;s HOW it SHOULD BE! Meaning, the $2.13/hr is what the to-go employee is getting for doing the to-go orders. WHY do you ONLY care about the tippers or possible tippers in the restaurant and NOT the to-go customers? That&apos;s NOT FAIR at ALL.

&quot;Expect something for the time in taking your order over the phone.&quot;

A KFC employee can do that as well as when I order a pizza. There&apos;s NOTHING to tip for as far as to-go when a person goes inside to pick up the order or they pick it up in drive-thru.

tricky
&quot;I don&apos;t think lordsy knows that most bartenders are making $5 or $6 per hour.&quot;

I didn&apos;t know that for sure, but, even if they didn&apos;t make that, it&apos;s still tip worthy to tip for the SAME ACTIONS NO MATTER&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;these people are making. It&apos;s the amount of SERVICE, NOT&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;the employee is making that counts as far as the tip goes. In other words, let&apos;s say bartenders didn&apos;t get tipped(hypothetically), then I wouldn&apos;t tip a Starbuck&apos;s employee either. Since I tip bartenders, I&apos;ll tip the Starbuck&apos;s employees, depending on what I get, which most of the time, it&apos;s a frappacino, NOT just black coffee. If I ordered a black coffee, then NO, there would be NO MORE service than a fast food place does when they fill a cup of coffee such as McDonald&apos;s. I compare what things I tip for and what things I don&apos;t to be FAIR!

In other words, if we all tipped fast food employees, then I&apos;d tip for to-go because then it&apos;s all FAIR. Meaning, EVEYONE gets tipped for EVERY type of service, but since they don&apos;t, I&apos;m ONLY going to tip for services that are MORE WORK than fast food places(excluding Sonic). Be fair is what I am saying, that if I get a cup of black coffee to-go at Starbucks and tip, then I&apos;d tip a McDonald&apos;s employee for doing the SAME THING, which is POUR coffee in a to-go cup and ring it up.

Treat everyone as EQUALS. It&apos;s NOT fair that a person at Starbuck&apos;s gets a tip for black coffee to-go, but not a McDonald&apos;s employee, it&apos;s just NOT FAIR or RIGHT. They make the SAME thing, at LEAST minimum wage per hour plus tips. I know because my sister-in-law worked there a few years ago.

 I think you&apos;ve set a new post record.

First of all, HOW DARE YOU complain about fairness when someone chooses to tip. It&apos;s none of your business whether someone tips or not. It&apos;s not about fairness at all. You seem to be saying that you took unfair tips yourself, and you didn&apos;t complain. People tipped you even though you&quot;did the same actions&quot;as someone at McDonald&apos;s. If someone wants to tip at Starbucks, that&apos;s their right. and you hav e no business judging them, as long as they don&apos;t require you to follow suit.

Second of all, when I said&quot;taking time away from the tipping guests, I meant that those to-go people have the right to have their food cooked as well, and that added pressure to the kitchen impacts YOUR ability to get served promptly wen you are stopwatching your server at Chilis. And yet, they are getting food at he same price without having to pay the piper. And you say that you don&apos;t care what people make. And you call US uncaring and unfeeling. Personaly, I&apos;d be happy to have restaurants pay their to-go people what McDonald&apos;s pays their cashiers. In our case, you&apos;d end up higher menu costs because that money has to come from somewhere. Plus, the kind of people who would work for that kind of money would probably not be able to handle the volume of business that our&quot;to-go professionals&quot;are currently doing(taking, ringing, packing, checking, cashiering out over $2,000 a shift). So they&apos;d have to have at least one, if not two more people to do the same job. More money, more payroll, higher menu costs.

As to the second chance thing, yes, I alluded to the fact that they have to unpack each order and verify it. they don&apos;t do that at McDonald&apos;s. More service right there. And unpacking one of our orders and going over it with the guest takes a couple of minutes, especially for a large order.

The fact is, the majority of people tip*something*for their service. Those who tip higher get preferential treatment as well as more personal service. Those who don&apos;t tip get the service that they pay for. They still get the basic treatment but that&apos;s it.

Phone-in orders aren&apos;t the norm at KFC and the like. So you can&apos;t compare an odd situation like you calling them for a big order that you want to cram down your throat with the normal level of to-go business. Their normal mode of business is non-tipping.

You&apos;ve got the wrong idea about what tipping is. It&apos;s not about tipping for&quot;actions&quot;. If that were the case, you&apos;d tick off actions and adjust your tip on some bizarre sliding scale(.30 for taking a drink order, .20 for delivering the drink, .30 for taking the food order, etc.). Tipping isn&apos;t done that way(YOU don&apos;t even do it that way).

As far as the tipping when picking up a pizza, I didn&apos;t comment on that - YOU did. I simply said that you yourself have said in the past that you don&apos;t have very many friends. Personally, I&apos;ve never picked up a pizza, so I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d put a tip in a jar, or even if they HAVE such a thing at the counter.

Here&apos;s the bottom line - if you order to-go food from a restaurant that normally operates on the tipping system, you should tip, but it isn&apos;t incumbent on you to necessarily tip at the same level that you would if you were dining in. It&apos;s the flip side about not being able to tip at McDonald&apos;s, a restaurant that doesn&apos;t have its payroll subsidized by tipping. You follow suit, depending on the circumstances.

Personally, I&apos;m not very much in favor of full service restaurants offering to-go services. I think it cheapens the restaurant&apos;s product. They do it for YOUR convenience and you should be grateful to those who provide that special service to you, especially when they&apos;re handling the volume of business that&apos;s being generated. I can tell you THIS though. Don&apos;t show the love and you&apos;ll end up eventually being FORCED to share the love, with either a to-go surcharge or higher menu prices. And the latter WOULD be unfair to those who don&apos;t order take out. I can guarantee you that in my restaurant, the only way that we&apos;re able to avoid either scenario is because enough people tip to make it worthwhile for someone to get their ass handed to them for 3 or 4 hours a night. If that stops happening, I can guarantee you that you the guest would suffer. The restaurant(or the server)isn&apos;t going to take a loss for on that much food going out the door).

 I get tired of the mantra that one should tip for take-out, or for any service, because&quot;...someone has to prepare your food,...for the time in taking your order ...,preparing the order, ...and ringing you out.&quot;Those are not the reasons we tip people - otherwise we should tip fast food severs, store clerks, the postman, etc, simply because they make our lives a little easier.

We do tip for a few reasons: a)tradition; b)because the wages of some service industry personnel assumes that their income will be supplemented by tips; and c)to express gratitide for personal service performed or to ensure good service in the future.

I don&apos;t think that it is&quot;tradition&quot;to tip for take-out service, and take-out provides little&quot;personal service&quot;. Also, one can&apos;t really be sure of the quality of service until they get home and see what is actually in the containers. So what is the tip based on?

When you pay restaurant prices, the mark-up on the food covers wages for the cooking staff, the hostess, and the&quot;regular&quot;wages for serving staff, and covers other costs such as the cost of providing restaurant space, heating and lighting, advertising, etc, as well as restaurant profit. When one uses take-out, a busy restaurant profits by providing space for more patrons in the sit-down service area. If nothing else, they increase their sales with less space and staff usage required relative to the food served. If it actually does cause a net reduction in the restaurant&apos;s profits, perhaps fees for take-out are justifiable.

I do agree that it is unfair to expect low-paid serving staff to spend any significant amout of time preparing take-out orders where tip income is expected to contribute little or nothing to their income. But the unfairness is on the part of the employer - they should pay staff adequately if a significant percentage of their work is to support take-out.(And if take-out is a very small part of their work - well, we all have parts of our jobs that we don&apos;t like having to do. If the income is otherwise good, you may just have to accept it.)

I don&apos;t object if servers want to&quot;overtip&quot;each other, but I do object when the rest of us are put down for not following suit. The general public expects to tip for personal services received, but they expect&quot;behind the scenes&quot;work to be included in the general price of the product purchased.

&quot;One can&apos;t really be sure of the quality of service until they get home and see what is actually in the containers.&quot;

Actually, that&apos;s NOT TRUE at all. I have at McDonald&apos;s, Burger King and other places have CHECKED my sandwiches, bags, etc. for ALL parts and pieces to make sure they&apos;re 100% BEFORE I leave the store. At KFC, I had ordered a 6 piece chicken meal deal that came with 2 sides and some biscuits. When I received the chicken, ONLY 5 pieces were in the bucket. I looked BEFORE I even left the counter, which is the responsiblity of the CUSTOMER to make sure it&apos;s correct before they just go home with the food. Last year, around Christmas time, I ordered a plain cheese cake, but called several times after that to ask about the fruit topped cheese cakes, but didn&apos;t order any fruit on the cake originally, nor did I change my order, but I think I had given my name when I was asking about the flavors of cakes because I had tried to order a strawberry topped cheese cake, but they didn&apos;t have that, so that&apos;s where the confusion messed have been. I did only order a plain cheese cake, but stupid me, didn&apos;t look at the cheese cake. When I got home, surprise, surprise, they had CHERRIES on the cake. I was SO PISSED and called them back to tell them, but they didn&apos;t have any cheese cakes made because this was a bakery, around christmas eve. My point is, NEVER trust the people hand you the food that it will be 100% correct. The customer is just as responsible for getting a take-out or call-in order that they&apos;ve placed to make sure it&apos;s 100% correct. Some people in the drive-thru noticed before they left and came back in the donut shop just to tell me that they had the wrong dozen given to them. I had told them I was so sorry and then tried to proceed to give them the correct dozen they DID order. My point is, ALWAYS double check the people that hand you your food. It&apos;s BULL that you have to wait until you get home. My mother has even made sure of her chicken order when she went to Popeyes by getting a napkin to touch the chicken with to count the pieces in the box, to make sure she wasn&apos;t shorted. That&apos;s just what you have to do. If I would have noticed it at the bakery about my cherry cheese cake, I wouldn&apos;t have been as upset as being home and opening it only to find out it&apos;s wrong. At least if I would have opened it at the bakery, I could have gotten something for this mistake, like a free donut or something, because I HATE cherries and my mother didn&apos;t want cherries either, but we lived with it. I could have gotten back my money if I would have noticed it when I was still there. I also could have noticed the mistake even before I actually purchased it.

&quot;I don&apos;t think that it is&quot;tradition&quot;to tip for take-out service, and take-out provides little&quot;personal service&quot;.&quot;

I agree 100%!

Kaiser said&quot;Tipping on take-out? Why, because you carried the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged them for me?&quot;

SDscooby said&quot;Agreed, I don&apos;t tip on take-out. Thats just ridiculous&quot;

incorporeal said&quot;I dont tip for takeout, I tip about 20%+when I eat in though.&quot;

Hunter S. Thompson said&quot;And no I don&apos;t tip if I get take out. If someone delivers it then I will.&quot;

Mike Wevrick said&quot;No tip for picking up. Tips should be for service and there basically is none when you pick it up yourself.&quot;

Flowmastered87GL said&quot;Never been tipped on take out though. EVER.&quot;

nhluluhr said&quot;This means no tips for Takeout, no tips for beer,&quot;

Notice that it states BEER, meaning opening a beer is less work than getting a cup of ice with coke at McDonald&apos;s for the customer.

The MAJORITY of people on this site agree that tipping on take-out is INSANE! So I&apos;m NOT the ONLY person that thinks it&apos;s just plain NUTS to tip on take-out. Even RedBeard agrees that it&apos;s just NOT traditional to do this.

&quot;And you call US uncaring and unfeeling.&quot;

It shouldn&apos;t CONCERN the customer that the server has to tip out a percentage of the take-out sales of that take-out order. That&apos;s NOT the CUSTOMER&apos;S business or CONCERN for that matter. What the CUSTOMER is having as&quot;SERVICE&quot;that is DIFFERENT from a fast food place, THAT is the ONLY, ONLY, ONLY thing that the customer should be concerned with. I&apos;m not saying that someone doesn&apos;t have a right to tip for take-out, because it&apos;s NONE of my concern what those others are tipping or not tipping, but what I am saying is that are the things that I&apos;m concerned with when I have gotten take-out before the few times in my lifetime that I have. I&apos;ve gotten 2 entrees from Applebee&apos;s a few years ago, which was&quot;Blackened Chicken Fettucine&quot;, 2 of them. I didn&apos;t leave a tip for ONLY those 2 entrees, you have to be NUTS. There&apos;s NO SERVICE that is provided that is NOT something that a fast food worker doesn&apos;t do. Things such as utensils, which have the napkin in the bag of utensils already. If the person happens to have to put the plate of pasta in a to-go container which doesn&apos;t make sense that the cook wouldn&apos;t do that, but if they do, that&apos;s still not more work than a fast food worker. Gee, the lady rung me up and took my VERY UNCOMPLICATED order, which was entrees&quot;As they come&quot;as well as put these things in a bag with utensils that have a napkin in the little plastic bag of utensils, how hard was that, REALLY? NOT more harder than what a fast food worker does at ALL! NO condiments had to be put into the bag either.

WHY should anyone be concerned with the wages per hour someone makes? It&apos;s NONE of ANYONE&apos;S business but the employee, unless they want to broadcast that information.

&quot;So you can&apos;t compare an odd situation like you calling them for a big order.&quot;

I can, because I HAVE seen one time a Popeyes where they had an order for 100 pieces of chicken that someone called in as my mom and I were there when I was a teenager. They still don&apos;t get tipped for those odd situations, so why not tip for odd situations if you want people to tip for non-odd situations, to be fair. It&apos;s NOT fair that the Popeyes worker doesn&apos;t get a tip for 100 pieces of chicken, but if I order 100 Buffalo wings at Dominios that they get a tip for that just because people at pizza places get tips, but fast food places(excluding Sonic)don&apos;t get tips.

&quot;It&apos;s not about tipping for&quot;actions.&quot;

It IS about actions COMPLETELY! Did my server have to make 2 extra trips just to get me my condiments? If the answer is yes, MORE tip for them if my entree is correct. Because if I have the completely wrong entree, the extra 2 trips don&apos;t mean anything anymore because of my ruined dinner. A lot of things I&apos;ve read on the internet states that&quot;Tip your server if they do more for you than normal&quot;, which that&apos;s the way it SHOULD be. More work, MORE tip. Less work, less tip, plain and simple.

&quot;And the latter WOULD be unfair to those who don&apos;t order take out.&quot;

The restaurant can set the prices they please. For instance, at Houston&apos;s, which I have only ate at once, a hamburger, but anyway, their rib entree is $22. That, to me, is a bit on the pricey side for a chain restaurant even though it is a bit more upscale than Chilis or Outback. So, NO, I don&apos;t agree that it&apos;s unfair to people that don&apos;t get take-out. The customers shouldn&apos;t have to pay for the servers wages for NO MORE SERVICE than a FAST FOOD WORKER, when they don&apos;t tip fast food workers(excluding Sonic). I have gotten take-out less than 5 times probably in my life-time, but still am interested in this topic. I dine in a LOT, so I still have the opinion that I&apos;d rather have HIGHER prices than to pay a server for doing NOTHING more than a fast food worker as far as taking an order over the phone such as a Dominios worker does and picking it up. The phone is just a DIFFERENT way of taking an order instead of face-to-face contact. It&apos;s NOT ANYMORE trouble than getting an order at the take-out counter. I&apos;d just MUCH RATHER pay HIGHER PRICES than give a take-out tip to someone that&apos;s essentially bagging and ringing up my food, which is something a fast food worker does for NO TIP, whether they make minimum wage or not is IRRELEVANT to the type of&quot;SERVICE&quot;and&quot;ACTIONS&quot;these workers are doing for their money. The tip is for GOOD SERVICE, not to bag up food and ring it up, which is what fast food workers do for NO tip. So I say BE FAIR, if a customer tips a fast food worker, then they should tip for take-out. Since people don&apos;t tip for fast food, they shouldn&apos;t tip for take-out. The tip is for the type of&quot;SERVICE&quot;, NOT to make up for the non-minimum wage the take-out server is getting. It shouldn&apos;t also have to make up for the tip out sales the server has to tip out to the other co-workers such as the bartender, hostess, and busser. Tips should be fair, meaning since we don&apos;t all tip for fast food, then we shouldn&apos;t all tip for take-out. If we all tipped for fast food, then we should all tip for take-out, plain and simple. Be FAIR to EVERYONE and tip for the SAME SERVICES that are provided. Either we tip all for take-out and fast food or we don&apos;t tip for take-out and fast food. The ACTIONS are the EXACT SAME. The fast food worker takes the order at the register, where as the to-go person takes the order either over the phone by a register/or writting it down or at the register. SAME ACTIONS should receive SAME TIP. Just like when tricky said about Starbucks workers doing the SAME ACTIONS as bartenders. Same thing with fast food workers vs. take-out workers.

Like flipping a cap off a beer is just not tip worthy. I don&apos;t really order beers. I usually order mixed drinks, very rare did I ever order a beer in my lifetime. I just don&apos;t understand the concept of flipping a cap is a&quot;Service.&quot;A fast food worker fills a cup with ice and coke for no tip, which is MORE work. That&apos;s just UNFAIR, VERY, VERY, UNFAIR to tip someone for less work, but not to tip someone for more work.

&quot;Personally, I&apos;ve never picked up a pizza.&quot;

That&apos;s really surpising. I&apos;ve never heard of anyone that never picked up a pizza before. I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s anything wrong with it, because there&apos;s not, just it&apos;s very odd. MOST people have in their lifetime picked up a pizza.

&quot;I alluded to the fact that they have to unpack each order and verify it. they don&apos;t do that at McDonald&apos;s. More service right there.&quot;

Actually, if a McDonald&apos;s worker wanted to do their job correctly, they would take the time to do just that. That&apos;s why at McDonald&apos;s there are more mistakes in general. That doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t do that at McDonald&apos;s because then 90% of the orders would be wrong if they didn&apos;t do some double checking. I was responsible for double checking the food I handed people whether in drive-thru, to-go, or inside. Drive-thru customers that tipped were like 7 or so people in the whole 2 years I worked there. A lot of those tips were on CHRISTMAS day, which I was working on, so the cusotmers felt more genereous. Some people felt bad I guess that I was working on Chistmas, because most places are closed. One of those tips was the guy that drove off without his $15.50 in change.

When the above classes of people work in job segments that traditionally rely on tips to pay most of their wages, then I will be on board as saying that we should tip them.

&quot;We do tip for a few reasons: a)tradition; b)because the wages of some service industry personnel assumes that their income will be supplemented by tips; and c)to express gratitide for personal service performed or to ensure good service in the future&quot;.

I don&apos;t think that it is&quot;tradition&quot;to tip for take-out service, and take-out provides little&quot;personal service&quot;.

It has also not been tradition for restaurants to offer full to-go service of their menus as a routine aspect of their daily business. In the old days, people rarely would insult a full service restaurant by asking for to-go service. In fact, people were hesitant to even ask for&quot;doggie bags&quot;in the better restaurants. But times move on. Restaurants have now noted what you talk about below plus, they are trying to accomodate their guests increasingly demanding lifestyles(and frankly, personalities as well). In our case, we bring in additional personnel and staff up our kitchen to accommodate the increase in sales and service. In the day, we ask one of our bartenders(if we didn&apos;t have to-go, we might even be able to get by with one bartender most days)to take time away from our bar guests to take a phone order, leave the bar to sack up the orders, and then ring out the guest. This is sometimes a $100 order. If if you can&apos;t see the difference between what&apos;s required to process food for 10 people in a nice restaurant and bagging up a few Big Macs, well then, I can&apos;t help you.

&quot;Also, one can&apos;t really be sure of the quality of service until they get home and see what is actually in the containers&quot;.

Which is what I alluded to when I said that you don&apos;t get a second chance with to-go orders. In our restaurant, this requires unpacking that $100 order with the guest and checking off the order. In the case of this $100, that&apos;s probably 10 - 15 different items coming out of three grocery sack-sized bags. In the case of the service provided in our restaurant, it starts when we answer the phone and ends when we assure the guest that their order has been fulfilled, and everything in-between. Because we don&apos;t interact with the guest face-to-face for more than a couple of minutes, I have never&quot;mantraized&quot;the idea that you should tip at the same level as tableside. I&apos;m simply saying that you need to acknowlege the economics of the situation and realize that you are purchasing a product and someone&apos;s time that is normally associated with tipping. The price of the product reflects that(you&apos;re basically buying food at a&quot;discount&quot;and you are hiring a food professional to process your order who otherwise would be employed taking care of you barside or tableside.

&quot;So what is the tip based on&quot;?

It&apos;s based on giving you the option to eat our food without having to wait an hour for a table. It&apos;s based on giving you the option to eat better and more nutritious food than fast food drive thru. It&apos;s based on giving you the convenience of dining with your co-workers in your break room. It&apos;s based on being able to eat the restaurant&apos;s food and still get back to work in time. It&apos;s based on receiving service from food professionals instead of clerks. And it&apos;s based on how the whole process is handled, from start to finish.

&quot;When you pay restaurant prices, the mark-up on the food covers wages for the cooking staff, the hostess, and the&quot;regular&quot;wages for serving staff, and covers other costs such as the cost of providing restaurant space, heating and lighting, advertising, etc, as well as restaurant profit&quot;.

It also covers the additional cost of to-go necessities. In our case, we spend a lot of money on microwaveable containers of 5 different sizes. We spend time preparing containers of 4 different sauces. We spend money on big, heavy-duty logo paper bags with handles. Etc.

&quot;When one uses take-out, a busy restaurant profits by providing space for more patrons in the sit-down service area. If nothing else, they increase their sales with less space and staff usage required relative to the food served&quot;.

Yes they do. They also slow down service to the in-store guests because they compete for stove and service time.

&quot;If it actually does cause a net reduction in the restaurant&apos;s profits, perhaps fees for take-out are justifiable&quot;.

It obviously doesn&apos;t. However, we&apos;re able to maintain the status quo because most people tip SOMETHING and to-go people don&apos;t have to be paid extra, although there are SOME chains that pay their people more, and as it turns out, those are the type of restaurants that routinely raise their prices every year. I&apos;ve been working at my restaurant for 2 years and we haven&apos;t had a price increase yet(for food items).

&quot;I do agree that it is unfair to expect low-paid serving staff to spend any significant amout of time preparing take-out orders where tip income is expected to contribute little or nothing to their income. But the unfairness is on the part of the employer - they should pay staff adequately if a significant percentage of their work is to support take-out&quot;.

Once again, your alternative is an increase in menu prices to cover the additional payroll. and I don&apos;t think that this is fair to the in-restaurant guests.

(And if take-out is a very small part of their work - well, we all have parts of our jobs that we don&apos;t like having to do. If the income is otherwise good, you may just have to accept it.)

But it&apos;s not. A&quot;very small part of their work&quot;. Haven&apos;t you been paying attention? Our night people work a full shift as a to-go person and it takes TWO of them to keep up with the $2000+worth of food that they ring(the average server rings between $700 - 1200 during the same shift). We have a couple of people who are dedicated to-go peoploe, everyone else who does it substitutes that shift for a regular shift. And I personally wouldn&apos;t do it because of the pressure of it(some people like it, I don&apos;t, and I&apos;ve never done it). For a bartender to ring and process $500 during the day isn&apos;t unusual. that&apos;s probably half of their sales(more usually).

It&apos;s NOT a trivial part of the job, even if you see it that way. You should appreciate the ability to eat nice food without having to suffer actually eating in the restaurant. And now, I&apos;m off to do a delivery(which I get an automatic 10% delivery fee and usually get a tip on top of that. this will probably be a $50 delivery for me, since it&apos;s only for about 18 people). But it&apos;s takes 2 1/2 hours, so I don&apos;t mind

I don&apos;t object if servers want to&quot;overtip&quot;each other, but I do object when the rest of us are put down for not following suit. The general public expects to tip for personal services received, but they expect&quot;behind the scenes&quot;work to be included in the general price of the product purchased.

Then I guess we have to raise prices across the board to compensate people for accomodating the publics desire to cheapen the dining experience. Ironic, eh?

And you shouldn&apos;t be so disingenuous. You grasp at EVERY opportunity to shave your tip, so you deserve to be upbraided every once in a while. Since you have a daughter who has lived off of tips, you should be just a little ashamed.

Yes, we know that 22 year old rice cooker car owners are experts on tipping.

You and redbeard(and those mulletheads on that Subaru forum)are behind the times. Organized take-out service from full-service restaurants is a very new phenomenon. Even 5 years ago, it was very rare. And in certain restaurants, it&apos;s pretty unheard of. In my previous restaurant, we didn&apos;t even have to-go cups for drinks! We had a couple of recording studio people who would call in an order about every month. They were the only people who asked for this service. And we got to know them quite well, partly because they always tipped, and we always bent over backwards to accomodate them. In my current restaurant, take-out takes up considerable real estate and energy, because we do a lot of take-out(I&apos;m on record here as saying that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s all that good of an idea actually, but that&apos;s just me). And our people get tipped more often than not, because people understand that we provide the same*quality*of service that we provide when they dine in with us, even if the*level*of service isn&apos;t the same, which is why most people tip 5 -10% and some even tip 15%. What&apos;s annoying to take-out people is when someone orders $250 worth of food and doesn&apos;t tip a cent on it, despite the fact that the to-go person has just put together a complex order filling 5 grocery store bags and about 15 minutes of just coordinating the whole bagging process. This happens once in a blue moon and when it does, it&apos;s not nice.

Once again, I will point out that if nobody tips on to-go food in a full-service restaurant, all the guests WILL pay more one way or another, because the restaurant is NOT going to lose money just to accomodate an OPTIONAL service being done to make YOUR life more pleasant.

 &quot;I&apos;d just MUCH RATHER pay HIGHER PRICES than give a take-out tip to someone that&apos;s essentially bagging and ringing up my food&quot;

Well, THAT makes a lot of sense :cue sarcasm button:

I bet you&apos;d even rather pay MORE money without a tip than you would pay the current prices WTH a tip, simply because you are baffled by the tipping process and are essentially afraid of it. You&apos;re like the proverbial housewife and the tip is the proverbial mouse in the kitchen.

I&apos;m glad that you&apos;re now on record as promoting a higher priced to-go menu or a&quot;pickup charge&quot;though. However, I&apos;ll bet the Subaru rats would howl in protest if they had to pay different prices for the to-go menu, or have all the prices go up because some people have the nerve to demand that they be able to order to-go food with impunity. They(and you, suspect)would cry,&quot;Why should I pay more money for just picking up food&quot;? It wouldn&apos;t help to explain to them(or you)that food prices are tied to payroll and that they(and you)virtually DEMANDED that the prices go up so that people could be paid a fair wage for serving them.

 &quot;&quot;Personally, I&apos;ve never picked up a pizza.&quot;

That&apos;s really surpising. I&apos;ve never heard of anyone that never picked up a pizza before. I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s anything wrong with it, because there&apos;s not, just it&apos;s very odd. MOST people have in their lifetime picked up a pizza&quot;.

Why on earth would I want to pick up a pizza when they&apos;ll deliver it to me? To save a tip? The $3 that I might tip on a pizza is well worth someone bringing me my pizza so that I don&apos;t have to get out and fight traffic. I order the pizza about 45 minutes before I&apos;m ready to eat, and magically it arrives hot and piping to my door at the time that I&apos;m ready to eat(heck, nowadays, I don&apos;t even have to call it in, I can access the website, get a virtual coupon and pay for the meal in advance). I prefer easy over difficult, I guess. The alternative is to go out and eat pizza in a restaurant, which I HAVE obviously done.

&quot;I bet you&apos;d even rather pay MORE money without a tip than you would pay the current prices WTH a tip.&quot;

NOT when I&apos;m dining in, because if they have a 20% service charge like in New York where the server gets a tip ANYWAY regardless of the service, that STINKS in my opinion. I don&apos;t want to do away with tipping for dining in. I don&apos;t want to pay a service charge for lousy service when I dine-in. I feel there should be higher prices for take-out so the employer could pay the take-out person those couple of hours or so that they are at the take-out station at least MINIMUM WAGE. This way, if the customer chooses not to tip, at least their hourly wage wouldn&apos;t be just $2.13/hr. See, most people don&apos;t know, which including myself didn&apos;t know, that the take-out person may only be making $2.13.hr, depending on the restaurant.

My point about the higher prices is that I CAN&apos;T STAND giving my money to people that DON&apos;T deserve it, meaning the to-go servers for the most part. I&apos;d rather see my money being given to the restaurant, than to the to-go server if I go to pick the food up and if it&apos;s not a complicated order. I don&apos;t think the server deserves a tip for bagging up to entrees&quot;As is&quot;and ringing it up. That&apos;s just fast food type of service that I&apos;m getting.

I feel tip for the people that do a LOT of work, not for flipping a cap on a beer, which is almost NO WORK. Granting getting a beer out, is part of it and ringing it up, but there&apos;s NO COURSE you have to take to serve a beer, NONE. I&apos;ve even served cans of beer in 1998, after my birthday in March, because I wasn&apos;t 21 yrs old until then. Sure I didn&apos;t flip a cap, but really, that&apos;s just NOT a huge service to tip for when as I said before fast food workers that fill a cup with ice and soft drink do MORE WORK. That&apos;s the TRUTH.

Even when I worked at the donut shop, I&apos;d get a daiquiri to-go. Over in Louisiana the laws are different. I can take an alcoholic drink out of a restaurant. Anyway, ALL the girl did was fill a cup with&quot;White Russian.&quot;I did MORE WORK filling the cups with ice and soft drink at the donut shop. So, NO, I NEVER tipped her for that, EVER. That&apos;s NUTS, when it&apos;s just NOT a service that is bartending, just like serving a beer. I can serve a beer WITHOUT a course, which I HAVE before at the donut shop. The white russian was made already by whatever company they order it from. I&apos;ve seen those workers put water in the machines and mix it up. That&apos;s not mixing&quot;MY&quot;drink that I&apos;ve ordered though. That&apos;s just general maintainance of their products, just like stocking products. Tipping is for MORE SERVICE than a fast food workers do. That&apos;s just the way I feel about it. To be FAIR to EVERYONE, by since we don&apos;t tip for fast food(excluding Sonic), then we shouldn&apos;t tip for take-out(excluding huge orders and curbside service).

&quot;Why on earth would I want to pick up a pizza when they&apos;ll deliver it to me?&quot;

I have a pizza hut literally 2 minutes from my house and I&apos;d rather only wait 20 minutes instead of 45 minutes, spend less money in gas than on the tip, so WHY NOT if it&apos;s that close to me and WHY NOT if it&apos;s a nice day wait LONGER for my food than necessary? I have a TOTALLY different opinion about this. My cheese sauces have been forgotten at Papa Johns I don&apos;t know HOW MANY times, but it&apos;s been a bunch, even when I was at my mother-in-law&apos;s house, which she tipped no matter what, because she&apos;d just write out the check ahead of time. Since she was paying, I didn&apos;t care what she tipped the driver, because it wasn&apos;t my place to say anything, because it&apos;s wasn&apos;t my money. Also, what if they bring you the wrong pizza? Instead if you pick it up, you have the ADVANTAGE of not only saving the extra 20-25 minutes that you&apos;d be waiting at home, but you would also see that they got your order wrong, which it would be SO MUCH EASIER to fix correctly if you are AT the pizza place, than if you are at home, that they&apos;d have to bring you a new pizza, which could take alltogether over an hour to get the pizza. That&apos;s why I choose not to get delivery. I am SO SICK of paying for the extra cheese sauces, which the delivery people seem to forget. I eat my pizza with cheese sauce as well as cheese sticks or bread sticks from Papa Johns. Same thing with Pizza Hut, instead of cheese sauces, I usually get extra tomato sauce, as well as a couple of ranchs. I didn&apos;t know that pizza would taste good dipping it in ranch until they had a pizza promotion for $9.99 with garlic sauce, ranch, and marinara dipping sauces. Then I found out I liked the pizza dipping it in ranch. So, if I would have it delivered, there&apos;s a BIG chance they&apos;d forget my ranch. They charge $0.50 per sauce at this Pizza Hut, so I don&apos;t like it when people forget things. I just don&apos;t see the point in getting it delivered when they could mess my order up, take twice as long to get to eat my food, and spend more in the tip, when it&apos;s on the same road as the main road as you go out the subdivision. I can get there in 3 minutes, maybe even 2 minutes if I don&apos;t catch the red light.

&quot;We provide the same*quality*of service that we provide when they dine in with us.&quot;

NO, the quality of service is more caring USUALLY when I dine in. I don&apos;t see a server when I&apos;ve picked up take-out,&quot;Do you have everything you&apos;ve ordered?&quot;It&apos;s not like when you are dining in and the server asks&quot;Is everything ok?&quot;The quality of service is the SAME as fast food.

Even my husband has the SAME OPINION as me. When I asked him, the ONLY way he&apos;d tip on take-out is(1.)If they are bringing the food and/or drinks to the vehicle and ringing the food up(2.)If he ordered a HUGE order, like 8 entrees.

&quot;What&apos;s annoying to take-out people is when someone orders $250 worth of food and doesn&apos;t tip a cent on it.&quot;

I DO AGREE that a huge order should be tipped because that is a LOT of service. Getting 2 entress just ISN&apos;T a LOT of service, it is just as much work as McDonald&apos;s. MOST people don&apos;t order $50 worth of food at McDonald&apos;s even, so I feel if it&apos;s a HUGE order to tip about 10%. I still wouldn&apos;t tip 15% unless the take-out server would say&quot;We are discontinuing that product, but I&apos;ll see if they can make it for you.&quot;I&apos;ve had that situation at a dine-in experience where I saw the food wasn&apos;t on the menu anymore that I LOVED, but I had asked the waitress&quot;Did they get rid of this dish?&quot;She said&quot;I&apos;ll ask to see if they can make it for you?&quot;See, that&apos;s a CARING waitress. MOST servers would say a flat out&quot;NO&quot;or&quot;Sorry&quot;without going through the trouble of ASKING. So I tipped that waitress well for making my last time I had that dish VERY WELL. If it would have been a take-out situation like that, the tip would have been 15%, even if it was for one dish only, just because the take-out server is caring enough to&quot;TRY TO GET WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS.&quot;

Example: At a buffet, which I was about 15 minutes earlier than it started. The waitress said we could get the buffet, because there were some things on it. This was at a chinese restaurant. Anyway, I had asked if I could get sweet-n-sour chicken and they made it for me as well as brought some out to me. Instead of the buck or 2 for a tip at a buffet, I tipped 15%. My point is, it ALL DEPENDS on if the take-out server has to go out of their way to please the customer.&quot;Did the take-out server have to get 3 sides of ranch, 1 side of mayonnaise, 2 sides of bar-b-que sauce?&quot;I can see tipping for that because when I&apos;ve even went to McDonald&apos;s or Burger King, I would get a cup with some tartar sauce in it or some mayonnaise. Fast food workers wouldn&apos;t have to get ALL those sides. So, to me, it&apos;s the AMOUNT of WORK that would go into an order if I would tip or not. If I only order 1 side of ranch, NO, I wouldn&apos;t tip just for that for take-out, unless I had curbside to-go.

&quot;They(and you, suspect)would cry,&quot;Why should I pay more money for just picking up food&quot;?&quot;

Actually, the restaurant can charge WHATEVER they please. They can refuse a customer&apos;s business, refuse coupons, etc. I wouldn&apos;t cry about it, I would accept it that if I didn&apos;t want to dine-in, I&apos;d pay HIGHER prices to the RESTAURANT, NONE to the server unless I&apos;m getting curside service or it&apos;s a huge order. A customer would maybe choose to pay extra to AVOID crowds of a restaurant and long waits for tables.

&quot;Yes, we know that 22 year old rice cooker car owners are experts on tipping.&quot;

By you saying this, it makes you look like you don&apos;t want to admit a LOT of people DON&apos;T tip for take-out. I KNOW there are some people that DO just because of my donut shop job experience. They tipped me, but for what really? I provided them with the SAME SERVICE that they could get a McDonald&apos;s. I didn&apos;t refuse a tip, WHO would really? At the same time, I didn&apos;t really deserve when someone would put a whole dollar or their change in the tip jar just for a dozen of donuts. I can see on Christmas people tipping more because MOST people DON&apos;T work on Christmas day. I wasn&apos;t going to refuse free money that added to my wages per hour, NO WAY. If I was to go to a donut shop, there&apos;s NO WAY I&apos;d tip for a dozen donuts and I haven&apos;t when I had gone. It&apos;s just not more service than fast food. I am saying though, MOST people DON&apos;T tip for take-out, especially when people got a dozen glaze through drive-thru, they didn&apos;t tip me. Which doesn&apos;t make sense because it&apos;s the SAME SERVICE as times when I&apos;d serve a dozen glaze to go at the counter. I don&apos;t get that really. People just see the tip jar and noticed it I guess. People want to get rid of their change I guess. That&apos;s the only things I can think of why for the SAME service, I didn&apos;t get tipped just because it was DRIVE-THRU.

What in the heck does how close YOU live to a pizza parlor have anything to do with whether or not I&apos;ve ever bothered to pick up a pizza? I don&apos;t care one way or another how you get your pizza. It has no bearing as to why I&apos;ve never wasted my time picking up a pizza when I can have it delivered to me in the safety and comfort of my home. I&apos;m certainly not going to go to Pizza Hut to dine in.

&quot;&quot;Yes, we know that 22 year old rice cooker car owners are experts on tipping.&quot;

By you saying this, it makes you look like you don&apos;t want to admit a LOT of people DON&apos;T tip for take-out&quot;.

I work in a restaurant that does between $1000 and 3000 worth of to-go food A DAY. What have YOU got? A board full of gripers. If most people didn&apos;t tip, I&apos;d say so and I&apos;d gripe about THAT myself.

&quot;I KNOW there are some people that DO just because of my donut shop job experience. They tipped me, but for what really? I provided them with the SAME SERVICE that they could get a McDonald&apos;s&quot;.

You seem terminally confused at this point. And I can&apos;t believe that you didn&apos;t just refuse the tips since you didn&apos;t deserve them. BTW, all that talk about the donut shop is just blather. I don&apos;t doubt that most people don&apos;t tip in most donut store transactions. Funny me, I thought we were talking about take out in a real restaurant.

&quot;Example: At a buffet, which I was about 15 minutes earlier than it started. The waitress said we could get the buffet, because there were some things on it. This was at a chinese restaurant. Anyway, I had asked if I could get sweet-n-sour chicken and they made it for me as well as brought some out to me. Instead of the buck or 2 for a tip at a buffet, I tipped 15%. My point is, it ALL DEPENDS on if the take-out server has to go out of their way to please the customer&quot;.

BTW, my last tip tonight was $25 on $66. Nice people. That&apos;s about as much than you used to make in tips in DAYS of donut slinging. And my delivery this morning ended up being changed to a regular delivery that we do to a local professional sports franchise that someone else usually does. Made $75 on that instead of the $40 or $50 that I was expecting(and it was a breeze). So, today was a good day. Made $205 in tips. ON A MONDAY. Worked 10am - noon. Then came back and worked 5pm - until 12:30. Not bad for 9 1/2 hrs work. That&apos;s $25 an hour including my hourly wage. Outstanding(and unusual, for that matter). And now I&apos;m off for two days. Cool.

Well, I got off on a tangent. I should close by saying that our lone to-go person walked with $100 on $1100 in sales(and they only worked from about 5 to 9:30). SOMEBODY&apos;S tipping on to-go. People who understand what service is REALLY all about. Hope you enjoy your working day tomorrow. I&quot;m sure that it will be profitable.

What a moron...way to invalidate every argument about how you did the same stuff as a server. STFU, biatch. &quot;Life&apos;s gonna suck when you grow up&quot;

ONLY if it was TO-GO, NOT, I repeat, NOT for the people eating inside. I did MORE because I took their order, got them refills, got them their food and their check if they ate inside. TO-GO IS just like McDonald&apos;s for EVERYONE, including MYSELF.

So YOU&apos;RE the mororn for NOT THINKING of people that ate inside. What a way to invalidate this argument. You are the&quot;biatch&quot;and STFU to you too. You are SO MEAN!

&quot;What in the heck does how close YOU live to a pizza parlor have anything to do with whether or not I&apos;ve ever bothered to pick up a pizza?&quot;

That my pizza was ready to eat about 20 minutes EARLIER than if I would have gotten it delivered. That&apos;s why I&apos;m in favor of going to pick it up. Also, WHY bother getting it delivered to pay extra if I live that close? That just doesn&apos;t make sense to me unless it&apos;s raining hard or something, then I can see, but a nice day, I really don&apos;t mind going that 2 minutes down the street. It saves me more money than my gas as well as wear and tear does. I just see that differently than you. I prefer not to wait as long for my food. You know I&apos;m even that way when I dine-in a a restaurant, so I choose to pick up my pizza from Pizza Hut. I have gotten delivery from Papa John&apos;s, but as I said before, they&apos;ve forgot my cheese sauces that I paid for, so I&apos;d just rather go pick it up, than have my order wrong. Either way, if the order is wrong, the delivery person won&apos;t be tipped anyway, so it&apos;s just better for me to go and pick it up. Dominos is 4 minutes away about and it&apos;s close enough that I NEVER get delivery there either. I feel why pay a tip, which is WAY MORE MONEY, to have your food take TWICE as long and possibly have your order wrong. I just see things different as far as delivery is concerned. Sure, it&apos;s more convenient to get it delivered, but it DOES take LONGER to get to you than if you pick it up, which sucks to me. Dominos is even CLOSER than Papa John&apos;s is, so that&apos;s why I&apos;ve only gotten delivery from Papa John&apos;s. I&apos;ve just had SO MANY mistakes with my cheese sauces. One time, the delivery guy forgot all 5 cheese sauces. I was pissed. I had even put a tip on the credit card ahead of time which was stupid of me. I did make someone come ALL THE WAY back to bring what I paid for to me. Meanwhile, I had the pizza in the oven staying warm. It kept happening so much that they sent me a free pizza coupon. I call in the free pizza to pick it up, repeat my order which was the pizza and 6 cheese sauces. Anyway, the order taker said the cheese sauces were free since I had told him I had a coupon for a free pizza. I go to pick it up THANK GOD, because come to find out that he thought I only wanted one cheese sauce, but I told them&quot;I ordered 6&quot;, so they gave them to me. BOY was I pissed and SO GLAD I didn&apos;t get delivery so they could get the damn order wrong ONCE again. I know in that instance it would have been the order taker that was at fault, but still, the end result would have been the delivery person at the door with only 1 cheese sauce. I reported it again to the manager when I got home because I wasn&apos;t going to have my pizza cold to talk to the manager in person. He said&quot;From now on I can have 2 cheese sauces free.&quot;So, my point is, I haven&apos;t ordered delivery since 2003 because the service is SO DAMN POOR. It&apos;s either the delivery driver that doesn&apos;t read the ticket and make sure everything is in the box before he or she leaves or it&apos;s the order taker that is getting it wrong. Either way, I&apos;m TIRED of CRAP service. So, at Papa John&apos;s that&apos;s why I NEVER get delivery ANYMORE. The service was poor as I stated before even at a different location, which was my mother-in-law&apos;s house. Several times I&apos;ve had my cheese sauces forgotten then too. We had a free pizza then too for all the times they forgot them. It&apos;s just ridiculous that people can&apos;t get the orders right. If the service was perfect, then I&apos;d get Papa John&apos;s delivery because it is a bit further, put it&apos;s not, it&apos;s VERY POOR, so I don&apos;t like delivery. That&apos;s why I don&apos;t like delivery and why I MUCH PREFER picking up the pizza.

&quot;I&apos;ve never wasted my time picking up a pizza.&quot;

Sure that&apos;s maybe your time, but the food gets to you sooner, so in my opinion it&apos;s nicer to just go pick it up. I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s ANYTHING wrong with the way you feel about it because there&apos;s not. If you like it like that so be it. I just have had TOo MANY times I&apos;ve had POOR service and the places are just so darn close, I&apos;d rather have my food in my tummy sooner than later.

Are you THAT much of an idiot? I didn&apos;t express any surprise that you pick up pizzas. YOU expressed surprised that I don&apos;t. There&apos;s nothing wrong with people who pick up pizzas instead of having them delivered.*I*just don&apos;t bother with it. I don&apos;t want to spend 10 or 15 minutes driving to and from the pizza shop and waiting to pay for my pizza, risking accident and putting wear and tear on my car just to save a tip and a little time. I&apos;m perfectly willing to pay someone to take those risks and put wear and tear on THEIR car, because I plan ahead of time to call in my order at the time required to get my pizza when I want it.

&quot;&quot;I&apos;ve never wasted my time picking up a pizza.&quot;

Sure that&apos;s maybe your time, but the food gets to you sooner, so in my opinion it&apos;s nicer to just go pick it up&quot;.

Once again, this has nothing to do with anything.

I DID find all of this inter-commentary regarding this hilarious. You really ARE a compulsive, aren&apos;t you? You can&apos;t even stop your long-winded natterings for such an inane&quot;issue&quot;that you&apos;ve made up out of whole cloth.

And it&apos;s funny that you can&apos;t even get decent delivery according to your standards. You have to be the most sad-sack person I&apos;ve ever heard about. The only way you can assure that you get things&quot;your way&quot;is by picking up fast food and you can&apos;t even get THAT done the way you like it a lot of the time. I&apos;ll bet when you only get one napkin from McDonald&apos;s, you blow a fuse because you expected TWO.

Hmmm. All the same stuff Mickey D&apos;s people do. Like I said before, you dolt, you worked fast food. Drive thru=fast food.

By the way, I do not have to be nice to you. YOU refused to apologize for the nasty things you said about my grandmother. I am just treating you the EXACT WAY you treated me.

Therefore, using your logic, you&apos;re getting what you deserve. YOU are the one who is&quot;SO MEAN&quot;. YOU are the one who is&quot;UNCARING.&quot;

Bite me, limavittu. &quot;Life&apos;s gonna suck when you grow up&quot;

They have drive-thrus at Starbucks, a sit-down restaurant that ISN&apos;T fast food at a restaurant here in New Orleans area, and daiquri shops also. Daiquri shop employees get tips too as well as Starbuck&apos;s employees, but they aren&apos;t fast food. Fast food people like McDonald&apos;s staff DON&apos;T get tips.

&quot;That IS a&quot;fast food place&quot;.&quot;

The restaurant was the one that had the manager that didn&apos;t want to comp the chilli cheese fries. I don&apos;t know if you remember the story, but we had serveral things that went wrong, one which was that the waiter ASSUMED I wanted the chilli cheese fries with my meal even though I had NEVER said that just because(at the time)-my fiancee&apos;had ordered an appetizer also. The waiter had said he&apos;d take it off the bill when a food runner brought the fries out FINALLY 2 minutes LITERALLY from when my meal came.

&quot;That IS a&quot;fast food place&quot;.&quot;

The restaurant was the one that had the manager that didn&apos;t want to comp the chilli cheese fries&quot;.

I thought that you were saying that Starbucks wasn&apos;t fast food. It IS fast food. You order either at the drive thru or at the counter and you pay at the same time and the food is given to you on the spot. Plus, you&quot;stand in line&quot;for real. I didn&apos;t know that you were talking about a different restaurant.

&quot;I don&apos;t know if you remember the story, but we had serveral things that went wrong, one which was that the waiter ASSUMED I wanted the chilli cheese fries with my meal even though I had NEVER said that just because(at the time)-my fiancee&apos;had ordered an appetizer also. The waiter had said he&apos;d take it off the bill when a food runner brought the fries out FINALLY 2 minutes LITERALLY from when my meal came. Anyway, we had been given the wrong check and didn&apos;t receive bread, which we saw EVERYONE else had bread. He and the food runner forgot my side of mayonnise. He wasn&apos;t attentive. This is a REAL restaurant that has waiters and waitresses, but still DOES have a DRIVE-THRU. It&apos;s called&quot;Corky&apos;s Bar-b-que&quot;I think that is the whole name.&quot;

Yes, I know Corky&apos;s. I&apos;ve known it for more than 25 years when THE ORIGINAL Corky&apos;s opened only a couple of miles from my home in Memphis. It is indeed a hybrid-type restaurant. Not only do they have a sit-down full-service area, but they have a drive-thru AND a big catering business. In fact, I was recruited by them for a management job a year ago but I turned them down, because I don&apos;t really consider them a&quot;serious&quot;restaurant(not that they&apos;re bad or anything). They&apos;re just a slight step up from a typical pickup BBQ shop.

&quot;Anyway, they also had a restaurant that closed down about 7 years ago called&quot;Wholey Macrel&quot;that had a, get this,&quot;Drive thru&quot;, but it was a REAL restaurant with waiters and waitresses and a bar also. It was a seafood restaurant&quot;.

Yes, there are one or two restaurants out of thousands that operate as a hybrid, but the exception doesn&apos;t prove the rule.

&quot;Starbuck&apos;s is NOT fast food. Sure the food is already made like the pastries they have, but it&apos;s still NOT a fast food place. Sure you can get it fast, but still isn&apos;t labeled&quot;FAST FOOD.&quot;

By whom? You? It is CERTAINLY a fast food place by ANY definition of the term. It just has a slightly different product mix than a typical McDonald&apos;s.

 Agreed Teleburst, I pass by not one but two Starbucks every day. On my long journey down the concourse behind security, To get to my bar.(That&apos;s right, my bar)From what I witness it is a take out joint. Got a big hairy news flash for ya too. Starbucks where I work gets all of those pastries delivered frozen. No there is not a Starbucks pasty chef arriving in the wee hours of the morning to prepare the daily confections. Only the commissary guys getting there before the sun rises to slam the chilly cases of pre packaged heavily preserved goodies in the walk in cooler. Now they are owned by the corporation that I work for. But we are constantly inspected by Starbucks, to make sure we are upholding their standards. Same with Burger King and Miami subs, their honchos are checking on us frequently. So I don&apos;t imagine its unusual that Starbucks gets its muffins and such already made.
Back to the original point Starbucks is fast food, if I have ever seen fast food.

 In my restaraunt which is not a chain, I have to do all my to go orders. So I take the order, give the order, get silverwear and all that stuff together. I don&apos;t have a person to do that for me. And at that time I may have 3 or 4 sometimes more tables to wait on. And they are all very needy. Then if I need soup, salad, or desert, I get to get all of that together. So if your going to stiff me for making your salad after I have not been able to take care of my other tables then I might be a little irritated. I&apos;m not asking for a lot but maybe a couple bucks. Not to difficult. I also have to ring all of your food up when you get there, and total it on the adding machine.(we aren&apos;t all high tech)What&apos;s a couple of extra bucks for the person who did all of that for you at only 2 or 3 something an hour? CHEAP A$$E$!!!

&quot;So if your going to stiff me for making your salad after I have not been able to take care of my other tables then I might be a little irritated.&quot;

WHY do you&quot;ONLY&quot;seem to care about your table&apos;s orders instead of EACH and EVERY customer&apos;s time? Just because the person gets take-out, doesn&apos;t mean they should not be just as IMPORTANT as the customers that are dining in.

&quot;I also have to ring all of your food up when you get there, and total it on the adding machine.(we aren&apos;t all high tech).&quot;

Get this, fast food places do this too. This is NOT something to tip for at ALL! WHY BOTHER mentioning something that McDonald&apos;s workers do, which is ringing people up?

&quot;Get silverwear&quot;

McDonald&apos;s has given my forks and knives as well as butters and syrups for my hotcakes. This is what a FAST FOOD WORKER DOES, WHY BOTHER mentioning it?

&quot;CHEAP A$$E$&quot;

It&apos;s NOT being cheap, it&apos;s treating people the SAME, meaning, if I don&apos;t tip a fast food worker to do the SAME EXACT things, WHY should I tip a worker at a non-fast food restaurant for take-out?

&quot;So I take the order.&quot;

McDonald&apos;s workers do this TOO!

&quot;Give the order&quot;

McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, and Burger King have had to tell the people that were cooking the food to put mayonnaise or tartar sauce in a cup for me. That&apos;s giving the part of my order. I&apos;ve also seen the person that took my order put some mayonnaise in a cup for me.

You really think that the clerk at McDonald&apos;s is waiting on 3 or 4 other full-service tables at the same time, do you?

Just let your first round drink wait for 5 or 10 minutes because someone who called an order in 30 minutes before you got there needs to pick up their food when you get seated and let&apos;s see how loudly YOU howl. I&apos;ll bet that the fact that they were IN LINE FIRST would suddenly take a back seat to your whiney-assed needs.

That has NOTHING to do with the service that a take-out order customer is receiving. In other words, the customer is&quot;ONLY&quot;concerned with&quot;THEIR&quot;service which is take-out. Do you really think they give a care about the customers that are dining in? HELL NO! WHY in the world would they even consider tipping someone just because they have a lot of customers? That has NOTHING at ALL to do with&quot;WHAT TYPE&quot;of service the take-out customer is receiving. McDonald&apos;s is packed sometimes, but do you see people tipping there? I think NOT!

Customers consider the type of service&quot;THEY&quot;are receiving. Just like that website I quoted from all those people that DIDN&apos;T tip for take-out.

 http://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=470548 

Just like the guy Kaiser said&quot;Tipping on take-out? Why, because you carried the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged them for me?&quot;Sure sometimes the person gets the utensils, napkins, and condiment packets also, but that&apos;s what fast food workers do. Customers DON&apos;T care about what other responsiblities the take-out server is doing, they just care about what service&quot;THEY&quot;are getting, plain and simple. The website even PROVES that by MOST of the people that say what type of service they feel take-out is.

&quot;Just let your first round drink wait for 5 or 10 minutes because someone who called an order in 30 minutes before you got there needs to pick up their food when you get seated and let&apos;s see how loudly YOU howl.&quot;

NO, WHOEVER ordered&quot;BEFORE&quot;me SHOULD get their order BEFORE me.

&quot;IN LINE FIRST would suddenly take a back seat to your whiney-assed needs.&quot;

NO, because if&quot;THEY WERE FIRST&quot;, I wait&quot;MY TURN&quot;like NICE and CONSIDERATE people do.

As I said before, I HAVE told a bartender&quot;He was first&quot;if they tried to get my order if I was AFTER that person, that&apos;s just ONLY FAIR and the RIGHT THING to do.

 In your post you keep using the word&quot;consider&quot;. Have you ever heard of&quot;consideration&quot;. The server in a non-fast food place is making $2.13 per hour while McDonalds workers make $7. Take into conseration that the non-fast food worker is giving less service to his/her tables while packing your order and tip accordingly.

It&apos;s obvious you only care about yourself Lords. Nobody and nothing is more important in this world than you, right? Just your petty needs; it&apos;s all that matters.

You&apos;ve obviously been dealt a bad hand in life, or you wouldn&apos;t be so needy. You wouldn&apos;t so recklessly disregard the people that have to give you service. Don&apos;t make every person that comes into contact with you suffer for it.

&quot;The server in a non-fast food place is making $2.13 per hour while McDonalds workers make $7.&quot;

So why is it fair for the&quot;CUSTOMER&quot;to have to be responsible for the wages that are NOT paid by the employer at a non-fast food restaurant? It&apos;s not my fault that fast food places give the SAME service as take-out, but do not get a tip(excluding Sonic). If I tipped fast food workers, then I&apos;d tip take-out, but I try to be FAIR since I don&apos;t tip for fast food, I don&apos;t tip for take-out. It&apos;s just only fair for doing the SAME ACTIONS.

&quot;Take into conseration that the non-fast food worker is giving less service to his/her tables.&quot;

As I said before, WHY would ANY customer be&quot;CONCERNED&quot;with&quot;OTHER CUSTOMERS?&quot;You really think they give a care about the other customers if they are getting take-out? They don&apos;t care, they just want to pay, get their food, and go home or wherever they go. They are NOT concerned with the other tables that may be getting less service. My husband and I(both agree), that we tip on the&quot;TYPE&quot;of service we receive.

&quot;It&apos;s obvious you only care about yourself Lords.&quot;

NO, I care about being&quot;FAIR&quot;to EVERYONE, meaning if I tip a bartender for making me a white russian, I will tip a Starbuck&apos;s employee for making me a frappacino REGARDLESS of&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;they make an hour. Even if they make around the same or even if the bartender makes more, I don&apos;t care, I care about what KIND of service I am receiving, NOT&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;someone makes. I could CARE LESS about their paycheck, so does a LOT of people that I pointed out on that website. They care about&quot;THE ACTIONS&quot;such as putting food in a styraform box, things like that. The customers aren&apos;t worried about the other customers dining in. WHO in the WORLD considers tipping on how&quot;OTHER&quot;customers are treated? Usually people tip on how&quot;THEY&quot;are treated.

All of these situations are excluding car-side to-go when they bring you the food, because that&quot;IS&quot;what I call&quot;SERVICE&quot;that IS NOT the same as fast food. I tip at Sonic, so WHY NOT if I was to be so lazy as to get car-side to-go, I tip the server then, but NOT if I am going inside to pick it up, NO WAY, unless it is a huge order like 10 entrees, I would consider tipping then, like 10%. NO WAY I&apos;d tip 15% unless it would be a very large order like 30 entrees, then I consider 15%.

IT&apos;S CALLED CONSIDERATION LORDS! CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR FELLOW DINERS, CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR SERVER. CONSIDERATION FOR EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF YOUR NEED FOR ATTENTION AND EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF YOUR RANCH AND TARTAR SAUCE EXISTENCE!

I can&apos;t believe that you are this much of a loser that people on this site and others trying to pound any amount of wisdom and class into that knot on your shoulders has been for nothing. Your obscure websites mean nothing. You are a heap of nothingness and are destined to remain that way.

&quot;IT&apos;S CALLED CONSIDERATION LORDS!&quot;

So whatever happened to consideration of my time and feelings when I ordered a drink? That just went out the window basically to give a&quot;FRIEND&quot;an item and chat. So, WHY should I have consideration for others, when others don&apos;t have consideration for me? It&apos;s a 2-WAY street. You treat me bad, I&apos;ll treat you bad. You be nice, I&apos;ll be nice.

Sure it&apos;s NOT in that same situation and that the take-out person may be going in order as well as gave me good service, but it&apos;s still NOT right to tip them but not to tip a fast worker, it&apos;s just NOT. I get better service at a fast food place than a bar as far as time is concerned a LOT of times. I don&apos;t mean the mistakes of the food, there&apos;s a LOT of mistakes with food at fast food places, I mean as far as RESPECT. I wish I could tip a fast food worker for RESPECTED my time and feelings as well as going in order. You don&apos;t see too many fast food workers chit-chat if there&apos;s a customer waiting to order at McDonald&apos;s. At least, I have NEVER seen anyone at a fast food place treat me like that before EVER. At bars, sometimes bartenders seem to DISREPECT the customer&apos;s wait. They want to have conversations, take shots, smoke, eat, whatever it is that is NOT working. McDonald&apos;s employees respect me MORE than bartenders it seems. That&apos;s pretty pathetic if you ask me because they want to make more tips, WHY wouldn&apos;t they care about the customer&apos;s wait? Those extra dollars can pay bills or go out to eat, or buy something. As renasue said&quot;What&apos;s a couple of extra bucks.&quot;More money is still MORE money than a person had before, so WHY NOT respect the customer&apos;s time by treating them nicely by serving them instead of chit-chatting or chit-chat at the SAME TIME as serving?

You&apos;re just saying that because you KNOW that a LOT of people AGREE with my point of view about what type of service is take-out really. It&apos;s just like&quot;FAST FOOD.&quot;I have gotten take-out maybe 5 times or less in my lifetime as far as a non-fast food or a non-pizza place is concerned. I don&apos;t get take-out very much is what I am saying, but still see that it&apos;s the SAME SERVICE you get at a fast food place. We all don&apos;t tip fast food employees(excluding Sonic), WHY tip take-out servers for doing the SAME ACTIONS just because they don&apos;t make as much per hour?

That has NOTHING to do with the service that a take-out order customer is receiving&quot;.

You&apos;re the one who said that McDonald&apos;s did the same thing as renasue did. That is patently false.

&quot;In other words, the customer is&quot;ONLY&quot;concerned with&quot;THEIR&quot;service which is take-out. Do you really think they give a care about the customers that are dining in? HELL NO! WHY in the world would they even consider tipping someone just because they have a lot of customers&quot;?

Because sometimes THEY might be at the table maybe? Because if they don&apos;t tip, they might lose that service or have to pay more for it eventually? Personally, I&apos;d be happy to get rid of to-go service for full-service restaurants. In my restaurant&apos;s case though, enough people DO THE RIGHT THING to make it worth continuing the service. Continue to be cheap though. You might find yourself locked out of to-go service for the restaurants that you like.

&quot;That has NOTHING at ALL to do with&quot;WHAT TYPE&quot;of service the take-out customer is receiving. McDonald&apos;s is packed sometimes, but do you see people tipping there? I think NOT&quot;!

Just because it&apos;s packed makes no difference. It just means that the customers have to stand in line longer.

&quot;Customers consider the type of service&quot;THEY&quot;are receiving. Just like that website I quoted from all those people that DIDN&apos;T tip for take-out.

 http://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php? 
t=470548&quot;

So what. You know what? I think it&apos;s wrong to kill people as well. but guess what. There are people who don&apos;t care and do what they will. Doesn&apos;t make it right.

&quot;Just like the guy Kaiser said&quot;Tipping on take-out? Why, because you carried the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged them for me?&quot;

No, because you&apos;re using people making server&apos;s wages and it&apos;s NOT JUST&quot;carrying the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged it for me&quot;. There&apos;s a lot more to it. But this has already been explained to you and once again, you refuse to listen, because you think you know more than everyone else, even though you have the education of a tramp.

&quot;Just let your first round drink wait for 5 or 10 minutes because someone who called an order in 30 minutes before you got there needs to pick up their food when you get seated and let&apos;s see how loudly YOU howl.&quot;

NO, WHOEVER ordered&quot;BEFORE&quot;me SHOULD get their order BEFORE me.

&quot;IN LINE FIRST would suddenly take a back seat to your whiney-assed needs.&quot;

NO, because if&quot;THEY WERE FIRST&quot;, I wait&quot;MY TURN&quot;like NICE and CONSIDERATE people do&quot;.

I don&apos;t believe you. You&apos;d complain about the 10 minute drink time, because you wouldn&apos;t know that renasue was serving a to-go person. You don&apos;t see, OR CONSIDER, what might be going on behind the scenes. You never do and as many times as people have tried to tell you, you just put your blinders on.

&quot;So why is it fair for the&quot;CUSTOMER&quot;to have to be responsible for the wages that are NOT paid by the employer at a non-fast food restaurant&quot;?

Because it&apos;s the way things are done. That&apos;s why you leave a tip when you dine in. You are responsible for most of the wages of the server already. It&apos;s thesame principle. YOU are paying for the convenience of not having to wait on a table, dine in the restaurant and pay the standard tip.

&quot;All of these situations are excluding car-side to-go when they bring you the food, because that&quot;IS&quot;what I call&quot;SERVICE&quot;that IS NOT the same as fast food. I tip at Sonic, so WHY NOT if I was to be so lazy as to get car-side to-go, I tip the server then, but NOT if I am going inside to pick it up, NO WAY, unless it is a huge order like 10 entrees, I would consider tipping then, like 10%&quot;.

Why would you do that when you&apos;re picking up the food inside? They aren&apos;t doing any more&apos;actions&quot;, are they? they&apos;re just bagging the food and getting the utensils, right? You seem confused at this point, once again.

&quot;So whatever happened to consideration of my time and feelings when I ordered a drink? That just went out the window basically to give a&quot;FRIEND&quot;an item and chat&quot;.

I hate to tell you this, but you just found out what your 15 seconds was worth to that bartender. Absolutely nothing. You should be ashamed of yourself, whining about 15 seconds.

&quot;Sure it&apos;s NOT in that same situation and that the take-out person may be going in order as well as gave me good service, but it&apos;s still NOT right to tip them but not to tip a fast worker, it&apos;s just NOT. I get better service at a fast food place than a bar as far as time is concerned a LOT of times&quot;.

You RARELY get&quot;good service&quot;whenever you go out to full-service restaurants. This should tell you something about your expectations. I&apos;ll bet if you asked the 2 or 3 friends that you have, that none of them would claim to have bad service 90% of the times that they go out. I don&apos;t dine out that often, but in my adult life, which is close to twice the time that you&apos;ve alive, I think I&apos;ve only gotten bad service once or twice. Seriously.

&quot;I have gotten take-out maybe 5 times or less in my lifetime as far as a non-fast food or a non-pizza place is concerned. I don&apos;t get take-out very much is what I am saying, but still see that it&apos;s the SAME SERVICE you get at a fast food place. We all don&apos;t tip fast food employees(excluding Sonic), WHY tip take-out servers for doing the SAME ACTIONS just because they don&apos;t make as much per hour&quot;?

That&apos;s because YOU DON&apos;T SEE what goes on behind the scenes to get you your food. Most people, though, understand what it means to get served by food professionals, even in a to-go situation, which is why they tip some money. Of course, none of us can tell you anything, because you&apos;re too hard-headed to listen and you know everything. You realy SHOULD listen to you betters though.

 So this one time at band camp, ohh I mean mcdonalds! I don&apos;t think this is the only post where I saw you compare a restraunt to some cr*p fast food joint. Sure both places have food and drink, but if you really want to p*ss and moan about service to make you feel good you have to go to a sit down restraunt. Then you can b*tch about servers going out of turn or forgetting tartar sauce. You know what, you should feel really good about stiffing someone who doesn&apos;t obey your every command or apologize when it&apos;s really busy and YOU didn&apos;t receive immediate satisfaction. Scr*w every one else in the restraunt. You just don&apos;t get it do you. If we(servers)did it your way, everyone would be pissed. On a side bar from another post, Who gets a drink at a bar in a styrofoam cup and b*tches about the service. You couldn&apos;t afford the type of restraunt that has one on one service for the whole night. BTW merry Xmas

I expect Denny&apos;s and McDonald&apos;s even to treat me with the SAME RESPECT by NOT EVER making&quot;PERSONAL&quot;conversation MORE IMPORTANT than a customer. I expect EVERYONE that serves ANYBODY to treat people with respect, whether it&apos;s an upscale restaurant or Wendy&apos;s. I actually get MORE RESPECT from fast food employees sometimes than I do from bartenders. I don&apos;t like when I see a bartender take a drag of a cigarette before they serve you or make conversation INSTEAD of serving you or take a shot of alcohol before they serve you, or eat, or clean or whatever seems to be MORE IMPORTANT than the&quot;CUSTOMER.&quot;McDonald&apos;s employees I would rather tip if they&apos;d let then some bartenders because I get respect from them a HELL of a LOT MORE than at bars. At bars, these bartenders want to do all those things instead of serve the public a lot of times.

WHO cares WHAT KIND of cup it is, it&apos;s&quot;HOW&quot;I get treated is what really MATTERS! So what if it&apos;s not an upscale place, it is the fact that, that bartender only cared about&quot;HER&quot;wants instead of her job. She didn&apos;t care about her tip that she could have had. The ONLY thing she cared about was talking to the friend and giving him the item. I NEVER did that to ANY CUSTOMER, EVER, EVER, EVER!

All I want is the same respect that the person would more than likely want when&quot;THEY&quot;are the&quot;CUSTOMER.&quot;I NEVER put my personal conversation AHEAD of a customer, whether it was drive-thru which usually had NO tips or customers dining in that did tip that were regulars for instance. WHOEVER came first, got served FIRST, out of RESPECT for the&quot;CUSTOMER&quot;, NOT so I can make more tips by serving the person that tipped higher. To be a NICE human being is how I treated people by thinking of&quot;THEIR&quot;time even if they didn&apos;t tip, like in drive-thru.

&quot;apologize when it&apos;s really busy.&quot;

WHAT in the WORLD does being&quot;REALLY BUSY&quot;have to do with&quot;BEING NICE?&quot;If you can&apos;t take 2 freakin seconds to say you&apos;re sorry, well your tip will reflect the nasty attitude you gave. Be nice and I&apos;ll be nice back, meaning you take that EXTRA 2 freakin seconds to say&quot;Sorry&quot;or if it&apos;s a huge mistake&quot;I&apos;m so sorry about that&quot;, you will receive MORE tip. What kind of human being are you not to at least say you&apos;re sorry if you mess up? I couldn&apos;t fathom doing that even when it was drive-thru, which rarley gave me tips, but I was something that you seem to not be&quot;CARING.&quot;I actually gave a CARE if I messed up because I actually FELT for the CUSTOMER. Jammie only cares about the MONEY, that&apos;s it, NOT human beings feelings.

&quot;Then you can b*tch about servers going out of turn or forgetting tartar sauce.&quot;

I have EVERY RIGHT to be mad about servers not getting my order right. I also have EVERY RIGHT to be pissed for having to wait longer because the server took our order, but then(which this really happened), went to the table next to us to get 6 people&apos;s food orders, meanwhile the cook didn&apos;t have our food on the&quot;NEXT&quot;list or even KNEW about it because the server wanted to&quot;SAVE STEPS&quot;instead of thinking of the party of 2 that only had 2 entrees that ordered FIRST. We had to wait for ALL 6 people to give their order, which possibly could have taken 3-4 minutes if there were questions and complicated orders. I have EVERY RIGHT to be furious when people make as if OUR WAIT DOESN&apos;T matter because they don&apos;t want to make an extra trip to the computer. If we ordered first, the NEXT thing that should be done is for the server to put in the order, NOT so we can wait for 6 other people that were seated AFTER us to place their orders before putting our order in, that&apos;s just UNCARING of the FIRST table&apos;s time. Our food DID take LONGER because of that. The sooner the orders are in the kitchen, the SOONER the cooks can start cooking the orders or at least be on the list to cook.

&quot;I don&apos;t dine out that often.&quot;

That explains WHY you don&apos;t see bad or good service very often. I didn&apos;t either before I met my husband and started to go out to eat so much. When I did eat out, it was not that often. NOW, I go out to eat EVERY friday night and saturday night or afternoon. So this gives me a LOT of experiences that you NEVER experience. If you ate foods with condiments, you&apos;d understand the frustration of the servers not getting your order right, but you don&apos;t, so you have NO CLUE as to what I go through SO MANY times. Not as much now since the times that I get a lot of condiments, I ask for the server to bring them before the meal, so condiments aren&apos;t forgotten very often anymore. You don&apos;t get to have your bill possibly overcharged very often because you don&apos;t go out to eat often. It&apos;s just like what my mom told me which is true about car accidents. She said that we are more on the road than they are so we are more likely to have more accidents, which we have had more than they have in the past couple years even. My husband got rear-ended 3 times in the past couple of years. I got rear-ended this year. My point is, the MORE a person goes out to eat, the MORE they&quot;UNDERSTAND&quot;just what a&quot;CUSTOMER&quot;goes through. When I didn&apos;t go out to eat often, I didn&apos;t have MANY bad experiences are exceptional great ones either because I didn&apos;t go very often. If you went out to eat as often as I do, order a lot of condiments, and have complicated orders because that&apos;s the WAY you like the food, you&apos;d UNDERSTAND a LOT MORE of what I go through. I LOVE going out to eat, just not always the service.

 Why exactly do you work you mental midget? That&apos;s why I get 100% on shoppers reports because I&apos;m a lousy bartender. That&apos;s why while working for this corporation as a server I was asked to Bartend which is a promotion. Because I&apos;m such a worthless employee.
Now let me tell you something you inbred moron, if perhaps you had to earn your way through this world you may have a different attitude. I bought my house, and furniture and car and make the mortgage payments. I have secured a job that I don&apos;t have to depend on anybody to sustain my lifestyle. Can you say the same? I don&apos;t think you can, you instead prostitute yourself to sustain your lifestyle. How does it feel to put out to be supported? You as much as admit it by saying that you didnt go out much before you met your husband. In addition to being financially independent I have my pride, do you? Or did you ever think about that while you were waiting for the next handout? You are awful judgemental for a little girl that hasn&apos;t had to earn their way through life.
As you put it&quot;what I go through&quot;, well if its so traumatic to go out to eat stay home. What the hell is wrong with you any way? When I go out I enjoy, its not a chore or something I must endure. You are really stupid if you are going out and spending money on something that you cant enjoy. Oh wait I get it now its clear as day, your husband is spending not you.

I meant relative to YOU.

I&apos;ve been dining out since LONG before you were even a wet spot on your momma&apos;s couch.

The reason that I haven&apos;t had that many&quot;bad&quot;experiences is because I don&apos;t walk into a restaurant with a chip on my shoulder, or with a hair-trigger axe to grind. I don&apos;t worry about 15 seconds, or someone actually TALKING in a restaurant(imagine that).

&quot;If you ate foods with condiments, you&apos;d understand the frustration of the servers not getting your order right, but you don&apos;t, so you have NO CLUE as to what I go through SO MANY times&quot;.

GASP! WHEEZE!!!! OMG.

Oh, by the way, it&apos;s great that you put yourself through this time after time. You can&apos;t even get your plactic cupped drink within your 15 second deadline!

&quot;It&apos;s just like what my mom told me which is true about car accidents. She said that we are more on the road than they are so we are more likely to have more accidents, which we have had more than they have in the past couple years even. My husband got rear-ended 3 times in the past couple of years&quot;.

Dearie, your mom is a moron. It&apos;s obvious that not only are you totally socially inept, you and your husband can&apos;t drive.

&quot;I LOVE going out to eat&quot;

Then you are a masochist.

 Jammie, lords doesn&apos;t realize what&apos;s important in the restaurant business. And it ain&apos;t HER. Even though she&apos;s a guest too. There are some people who&apos;s expectations are so out of the mainstream that you simply deal with them and move on. And that&apos;s why she will be disappointed more than not. And that&apos;s why she couldn&apos;t even get an entry-level job as a server.

&quot;if perhaps you had to earn your way through this world you may have a different attitude.&quot;

NO, even if I did have to do things on my own, I COULDN&apos;T just treat people UNFAIRLY, I COULDN&apos;T live with myself knowing I was so MEAN and UNFAIR because I don&apos;t like it when people make me wait longer for no real reason, so I wouldn&apos;t make them wait longer.

McDonald&apos;s employees care about their customers even though they don&apos;t make tips. I don&apos;t see ANY of them giving preferential treatment. So just because there&apos;s more money to be made as a bartender doesn&apos;t mean that the respect should stop with McDonald&apos;s. Bartenders should give the SAME respect whether the person tips or not, out of common decency. Sure it&apos;s not nice that the person doesn&apos;t tip if you gave them good service, but HOW will you KNOW if they won&apos;t tip if you don&apos;t give them a chance to have good service because you decided to make Joe Smoe the $20 tipper more important. Just maybe, you can make $20 plus more from just Joe Smoe and Jane Doe if you treat them with RESPECT, BOTH of them with RESPECT. NOT one more important than the other. Just because Joe Smoe pays more for his service doesn&apos;t make him above the rest of the customers as if he&apos;s god, because he&apos;s just a customer as ANYONE ELSE is. If Jane Doe came up to the bar first, serve Jane Doe first. So what if Joe Smoe paid more, it&apos;s all about RESPECT.

&quot;I don&apos;t think you can, you instead prostitute yourself to sustain your lifestyle. How does it feel to put out to be supported?&quot;

I don&apos;t PROSTITUTE myself and&quot;PUT OUT&quot;to be supported. I have ALWAYS wanted a relationship to last forever since I was 12 yrs old. I HATED being single. I would rather any day have a husband or if I wasn&apos;t married, a boyfriend over being alone. Life is more fun with someone to share it with. So, I am NOT just with my husband for the money if that is what you are implying. You seem to be JEALOUS that people didn&apos;t help you out financially and YOU had to do ALL on your own. It doesn&apos;t make me feel bad AT ALL that I didn&apos;t get this house on my own, NOR did my husband. We got help from his family. His grandma gave us $10,000, a rental house which was sold to pay for this house, furniture(the other grandma gave us some too), and his great-grandma gave us money for the refrigerator, washer and dryer, and part of the money for the dining room table. So, do you really think my husband CARES HOW he got here, HELL NO! We care that we have a nice house with nice things and get to go out to eat as often as we do and go to do things out the house as often as we do. WHO CARES if I didn&apos;t earn it or if he didn&apos;t, I could care LESS. I&apos;m HAPPY, VERY HAPPY, with my life whether I earned my lifestyle or not. It feels GREAT being supported. Sure, if my husband would die before me, it would be hard to support myself, but at least I wouldn&apos;t have to pay rent because the house is paid for in full.

&quot;You are awful judgemental for a little girl that hasn&apos;t had to earn their way through life.&quot;

My mom is supported though my dad, SO WHAT! My husband&apos;s grandma NEVER held a job and is supported by the grandpa, SO WHAT! WHO GIVES A SH**WHO earned it!

&quot;You are really stupid if you are going out and spending money on something that you cant enjoy.&quot;

I ALWAYS usually enjoy the food and drinks, it&apos;s the SERVICE that I don&apos;t always enjoy. I do enjoy the service for the most part MOST of the time in general. I am NOT usually giving zero tips or anything close to that. I feel even it&apos;s 10% service worth, I still had a decent time, it wasn&apos;t bad or anything. It was still good, just not great for 10% service.

You seem a bit JEALOUS that you are griping about the fact that I didn&apos;t EARN my way to this lifestyle. You WISH you could enjoy going out to eat as much as I do instead of working crappy shifts as a bartender. MOST people don&apos;t want to work at night time in general. Maybe you do, but I bet you wish you wouldn&apos;t have to breathe second hand smoke if you don&apos;t smoke. That&apos;s a job I would NEVER take because I had ENOUGH with smelling like a cigarette when I came home from the donut shop. It also was BAD for my lungs to breathe that constantly. It just seems you&apos;re getting DEFENSIVE. You&apos;re trying to JUSTIFY treating people UNFAIRLY. Maybe it doesn&apos;t bother you to wait 3 minutes longer to order even, but I bet MOST people it DOES bother. I still feel when it&apos;s&quot;YOU&quot;in the line of people at McDonald&apos;s(for example), I bet you&apos;d be pissed if you had been waiting 5 minutes for your coke and the person behind you gets their coke before you do. Also, there&apos;s got to be times where you just want to go home or eat dinner or wait to go to the bathroom when you get home or whatever it is that you&apos;d rather NOT wait longer in a line. If you say no, I&apos;d be suprised because you would be the most easy going person I would know as far as the internet goes. Most people don&apos;t like waiting in a line. Think of people that wait in line for returns for christmas, you really think people want to WAIT LONGER if instead they could jump in front of the line? NO WAY! All I am saying is think how&quot;YOU&quot;feel when you&apos;re in line and HOW you are treating people&apos;s waits.

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/2737.html 

&quot;Too bad if they had to wait for another minute or so.&quot;

Well, that seems pretty SELFISH on your part that you didn&apos;t care if they did have to wait an extra minute or so. See, you really DON&apos;T CARE about the customers, just yourself, the money, and&quot;YOUR&quot;time.

 ...feeling particularly anal today.
Me too!
So the posts are going back in time to Lord&apos;s dribble about caring about well nothing but her. And her time as a doughnut shop nothing. Nothing we can say to her will change her mind... get the theme here lords... you and nothing... that&apos;s what you are!
I didn&apos;t give a crap about&quot;my&quot;money and&quot;my&quot;tips when one of our cooks wife died... I MADE the jar and took it table to table to table for a week... took in $2000... why because there are people that care about others. NOT JUST WHO WAS FIRST! There is a REAL world out there with people that like to socialize, who enjoy going to a restaurant and being remembered, who enjoy the chit chat who enjoy chatting with their neighbor that ends up at the same restaurant as them and don&apos;t walk in with a stop watch. You call all of us selfish... we WORK for crap wages because we know that we are not selfish. We on this site may not&quot;know&quot;each other but the restaurant business is a&quot;family&quot;. That&apos;s why we care about what we have to say... no we don&apos;t really care what you have to say because you don&apos;t have a clue what it is like to actually multitask, care, and be fair to everyone. All your spewing just makes us more thankful that we are us and NOT you!
MOST people THANK GOD don&apos;t have the same standard of retardedness that you do and that&apos;s why we pay our rent, bills, mortgage, and enjoy laughing at you. You have no clue because you will never ever be able to pay your way threw life. You can&apos;t... WE CAN!
Does that bother you that you are a useless human being and can&apos;t do anything but bitch and we can go out in the real world and make a GREAT living and support ourselves? Because you sucked so bad at your job and couldn&apos;t make tips you take it out on the ones that actually can take care of so many tasks at one time it confuses you and you are jealous because you had to do the rainman thing and you know&quot;wheel of fortune&quot;... because that is what you sound like.
To be honest I know a table like you from a million miles away and I don&apos;t give a crap about you, your stop watch, your condiments, your dollar... or your stiff... I don&apos;t care about you! I care that the restaurant I work at makes money... not giving you free food. You ask for all your crap where I work... I&apos;ll tell you NO! Because you are just out for free food and drinks.
By the way I think you still owe people on this board some apologizes!!!!!! Or when you die from your evil heart disease do you want to do that in hell????

 Is this what you wanted us to reread rainman with no clue! SHUT UP YOU INBRED UNCARING RETARD!

meeulk
&quot;But does anyone have anything they do personally?&quot;

I am not a server, but as a customer I tip better if the server apologizes for a mistake. A waiter a Chilis one time brought me diet coke instead of dr. pepper, just because he said he was sorry(also acted like he was sorry)I tipped him better than if he didn&apos;t apologize at all. Sure, it&apos;s a minor mistake, but it&apos;s still nice to feel that the server cares that they&apos;ve delayed your order.

I also feel, if the mistake is major such as a completely wrong entree, the SERVER is the person that should go talk to the manager about exactly*HOW*it should be handled by asking if the manager could comp something for the customer&apos;s inconvenience. DON&apos;T wait for the customer to call the manager.

I also feel, if the server goes in order that requests come in, that the customer won&apos;t be waiting as long for things.

#1 rule that I feel will DEFINATELY increase your tips as far as being able to get the order correct is*REREADING*the order that was written down*BEFORE*bringing it to the customer.

This past weekend my husband and I went to Chilis. I had ordered extra fries instead of cinnamon apples, also 2 sides of bar-b-que sauce, and 1 side of mayonnaise. I also ordered a side of ranch, but I got that brought to me suprisingly. Well, this mean server has the GALL to ask&quot;So what did you order?&quot;She had written down the WHOLE order, so she was just TOO LAZY to reread it BEFORE bringing it to me. She made 5 mistakes with my entree.
1. Bringing it to me wrong to begin with.
2. Side of mayonnaise
3. 1 side of bar-b-que sauce
4. 1 side of bar-b-que sauce
5. NO extra fries and cinnamon apples

These were ALL OBVIOUS mistakes. This was NOT like onions on a burger that would be hard to see, these things a server can see very easily. She didn&apos;t apologize for these mistakes either.

She also made another mistake. I ordered a margarita appox. 9:02p.m. which happened to be right before our food came out and it didn&apos;t get to my table until 9:35p.m. The server had came up to my table after we finished eating, which was 9:20p.m. and she had the GALL to ask&quot;Someone didn&apos;t bring out your margarita?&quot;I told her&quot;NO, that I have been waiting almost 20 minutes.&quot;I am thinking in my head,&quot;It&apos;s*YOUR*job to make sure that the drink comes out in a timely manner.&quot;Anyway, I got the manager and the manager told me that they were out of the shakers for the&quot;Presidente&apos;margarita.&quot;I also told the manager that she shouldn&apos;t have brought it out wrong and she told me that the server printed the ticket correctly as if to take up for the server almost. I was SO pissed. As, if the ticket printing is the ONLY thing that is important when taking food to the customer. The order should be used BEFORE taking the food to the customer as well as putting the order in correctly in the computer. WHAT good did it do to print the ticket correcly? It didn&apos;t do me any good, did it? The food came to me WRONG, that was the result.

I also feel that the bartender and the server should have had some type of*COMMUNICATION*as to let the server know that the margarita was going to be in a different glass. See, if the server was CARING, she would have went to ask the bartender about my drink like within 10-15 minutes, not wait about 20 minutes to come to my table to ask me if someone brought the drink or not. Even a simple note by the glass could have helped this situation. Since the bartender gets a tip out percentage, I hold the bartender responsible for not communicating. I also hold the server responsible for not checking on my drink. Communication would have helped possibly. She also had the gall to go to 2 other tables BEFORE even going to the bar as if she didn&apos;t care about my long wait. She was really mean. I seriously doubt that when she&apos;s the customer that she wants to wait a half an hour for a drink.

Think about it, if I order a hamburger and the server brings me a chicken sandwich, just because the cook messed up doesn&apos;t mean that the customer should have to REPEAT the order when the food arrives and that the server should put their*TRUST*into the cook for their tip. That server did, she got ZERO tip for being so uncaring of a human being.

See, as I had told her about the margarita taking about 20 minutes, I also told her that she brought the food out wrong and her response was&quot;WHATEVER.&quot;I was thinking, what a bitch. Also when we ordered, I had told her about that we need utensils. This was approx. 8:30p.m. At approx. 9:02p.m. when I had ordered my margarita, I had REMINDED her again about the utensils. Well, anyway, when it was 9:20p.m. when I was telling her about my margarita taking almost 20 minutes, I told her that I shouldn&apos;t have had to remind her about the utensils. I couldn&apos;t believe that her response was&quot;It&apos;s the hostess job.&quot;I KNOW it is, but I don&apos;t think the CUSTOMER should have to get their own utensils, that just SO RUDE of her. Even my husband agreed 100% to leave this bitch ZERO.

I mean, really, to have the GALL to ask me when my food arrives&quot;So what did you order?&quot;That makes the server look STUPID, VERY STUPID, when she wrote EVERYTHING I SAID DOWN, I saw her. I feel she could have taken 10 seconds to reread the order BEFORE taking it to the customer. This was NOT team work at ALL. Team work is to CATCH OTHERS MISTAKES BEFORE THEY GET TO THE CUSTOMER, which should be the ultimate GOAL, to ELIMINATE mistakes or make them RARE, NOT OFTEN. The server thinks that she only needs to print the ticket correctly and that she can just put her*TRUST*into the other workers, but that&apos;s just NOT TRUE at ALL!

Example: Let&apos;s say I am the server and the customer at a table hands me the check with a $50 bill. The bill is $10.00 total. I go to the bar to get change. The bartender is busy, so he hands me only $10.00, thinking it is a $20 bill. So, if I would take it to the customer, I&apos;d look pretty dumb that I didn&apos;t realize that I was just handed the bartender a $50 bill. I would have to go back to the bar to get $30. The difference is here, that they don&apos;t have any order written down, it&apos;s all by memory. With food orders if they are written down, there&apos;s ALWAYS a way(unless the server loses the paper or didn&apos;t print the ticket correctly)to VERIFY if the order is 100% correct or not by REREADING the order.

My point is NEVER, EVER, put trust into your co-workers for your tips. TAKE CHARGE of your destiny and get it right, even if the cook didn&apos;t. This way your tips WILL be better more than likely if you get the order 100% correct.

It&apos;s like a school project. If I am in a group of 4 people and the other 3 people all put their trust into just me for the grade. Then, it&apos;s possible that they may ALL get an*F*. But, if they all worked as a*TEAM*together checking over each others work, then they&apos;d maybe at least get a*C, B, or A*. They may be the blame for the*F*, but I would tell the other group members,&quot;Look it&apos;s NOT my fault that I didn&apos;t get ANY input or double checking from ANYONE else.&quot;

I understand in school people have more time, but if you want to get a good tip, get the order CORRECT.

As far as drawing smiley faces, that just doesn&apos;t make a difference to me. This particular server wrote&quot;Thanks.&quot;Do you honestly think I CARED about her tip after waiting a half an hour for a margarita and my order having been messed up? NO WAY did I care if she wrote&quot;Thanks.&quot;

I just feel, be NICE. Even if the customer is WRONG, just be nice and NEVER ARGUE with a customer. Just get the order right, don&apos;t argue, even if they did say&quot;With onions&quot;and now they don&apos;t want onions. It&apos;s not fair that they lied, but arguing is DEFINATELY NOT going to give you a good tip.

Double check the bill also. Don&apos;t put the responsiblity on the customer to catch a mistake. Also, definately apologize for something like that.

My point is rushing will NOT get you a good tip because I know when I rush, I actually make more mistakes. I think MOST people tend to be like that when they rush. I&apos;d rather the server take 5 minutes more to get something to me 100% correct, than for me to have it WRONG. That&apos;s my HONEST answer.

 Common decency is to tip.Besides where did I ever post I only wait on Joe Smoe? And nobody else? This bull of giving other people a chance how do you know I don&apos;t? You certainly have jumped to many conclusions, because I said that a known twenty dollar tipper wouldn&apos;t wait.(and He wouldn&apos;t)Now honestly lords how many of those do you think I encounter a day? Those who do tip to that extreme want the preferential treatment and are willing to pay for it. The its not fair banter is so infantile that I&apos;m not even going to respond to it any longer.
I don&apos;t care about customers like you.
Jealous of you is the best laugh I have had in a long time. No lords I&apos;m not jealous of you or your long line of non working looser trailer park trash women that your family has generated. If my husband fell of the face of the earth today I would live just the same as I do now. You are the one who in every post has a problem or ugly words not me, I love my life and have a wonderful family. We don&apos;t sweat the small stuff at my house, even my sons teenage friends are always here and some have told me they wish they could live here with us.(that&apos;s how uncaring and selfish I am)I think you are the one who in envious of severs and bartenders who make at least twice the money you do. You have to hold that almighty tip over their heads. I wouldn&apos;t want your crappy little tip.You are not that important that&apos;s why bartenders continue to talk and smoke and eat instead of waiting on you. Besides in the state of Florida there is no smoking in places that serve food at over 10% of the gross sales. I know that you are somewhat of an inbred and don&apos;t read the paper, you are too absorbed with which restaurant you will terrorize next. This has been going on for 2 1/2 years.

 Lords blathered:

&quot;You seem to be JEALOUS that people didn&apos;t help you out financially and YOU had to do ALL on your own. It doesn&apos;t make me feel bad AT ALL that I didn&apos;t get this house on my own, NOR did my husband.&quot;

You think people here are jealous of you? Are you serious? You&apos;ve proven that you don&apos;t have enough self-respect to support yourself and neither does your husband. You don&apos;t have common decency and can&apos;t comport yourself with dignity or any class in public. You don&apos;t understand basic human interaction.

We&apos;re not jealous. Just contemptuous. Look it up. You&apos;re the dregs of society. You&apos;re the woman that will live off of the state when your husband finds a better woman and you can&apos;t support yourself, and that wouldn&apos;t be hard now would it?

You&apos;re a Jerry Springer episode in the making.

 Let me add lords my parents are of considerable means and have offered many times to help me. I have declined, gracefully. I am able to support myself, and quite comfortably. Why would I accept their generosity, when I am capable of generating an income? I am not so selfish that I would take from them and their retirement, which they have earned. My grandmothers house is up for grabs, I say sell it and keep the money. Not like some people who take, take and take whatever is being offered. That to me is disgusting, when you have two able bodied young people who can work to purchase their own home.You are the lazy, uncaring one, instead of telling the in laws to sell the house and take a world cruise, or sock it away since you dont know what old age will bring. Nope not you, see what else you can get out of them before your husband divorces you.

&quot;Common decency is to tip.&quot;

It&apos;s common decency to go IN ORDER instead of just thinking of YOUR INCOME. It&apos;s common decency for servers to apologize for their mistakes, which MOST DON&apos;T. It&apos;s common decency to CARE about your customers.

&quot;We all know you dont have to agree with everybody but there is no need for insults, except in her case.&quot;

Isn&apos;t that the pot calling the kettle black.

&quot;Why exactly do you work you mental midget?&quot;

&quot;Now let me tell you something you inbred moron.&quot;

&quot;How does it feel to put out to be supported?&quot;

&quot;You are really stupid if you are going out and spending money on something that you cant enjoy.&quot;

There was NO NEED for these insults, NONE, as YOU stated. If you can&apos;t see that you&apos;ve insulted me, you need glasses, because you DID insult me. HOW DARE you tell me that I write insults when you do! What a hypocrite you are! Look at YOURSELF BEFORE you tell others off.

 Lords your idiocy is an insult to the world. We&apos;ve told you over and over how you&apos;re wrong and why, but you only listen to the voices in your head. People try to help you but you don&apos;t want to learn how to behave in public. You&apos;d rather argue and the more you argue, the more stupid you appear because you rarely make any sense. You don&apos;t understand basic human interaction and/or the niceties of manners.

 big_momma... and all here is a post from my 17 year old child who does not stamp her feet when things don&apos;t go how she wants them but is so thankful for everything she has... Imagine that.. loving life and yourself nothing that Lords of evil would know any thing about but here we go lords...
read and never reproduce!


SARA says:

I understand how you would be able to know the complexities of servers, especially when you come from such an expansive background such as a doughnut shop. It must be difficult for you to wait the extra few minutes to be served when a server is undergoing the indredibly simple, completely unexasperating duty of multitasking which he or she was hired to do. I completely empathize with you. Believe me, when I have to deal with the imcompetence of America&apos;s laborists, I become discontented and often think of&quot;I don&apos;t get service like this over at a fast food joint.&quot;

Okay, now that I&apos;ve gotten the sarcasm out-and I do hope that someone as superior(there I go again)as you would have caught on at some point. Back to fast food. If you were a worldly - or even right-in-your-backyard type of person- you would realize that when you step into a fast food resterant, there is a)more than one person waiting to serve you b)food already smooshed and ready to be given and c)no need for interaction, unless the person at the counter has never worked register and doesn&apos;t know which button to press. On the other hand, a sit-in and dine resturant has personal service and the servers have more to do than just give you your food. Realize that while you are too self-centered to see that there are other people waiting to be served, there are others being patient.

Next time you go out to eat or drink. Observe them. See how they are calm and patient? Learn from them. However inept you seem, surely you can adapt these foreign things called&quot;manners.&quot;It may be hard to accomplish at first, but you can, eventually, perform them yourself.

Thank you for your time and I hope that you can realize how lacking you are in the knowledge department and keep your petty comments to yourself. Plus, you ever notice that fast-food resturants never get your order right? It&apos;s because they, themselves, do not multitask.

P.S. My mom says to bite her. People earn respect, and the rate at which you&apos;re going, you&apos;ll never have any.

 lords, redbeard was trying to join a discussion, that&apos;s all. He has not been rude or belligerent to any person on this board. You cannot say the same. Are you really incapable of having a normal conversation with somebody? You and I have been doing battle for many months, which might I add you initiated. By calling servers stupid and lazy. You have absolutely no respect or consideration for anybody. Speak freely on issues in which you know nothing, but you are too busy being right to learn anything. I have pointed this out to you before, two boards that I read your posts(here and bitter)not one person agrees with you. As a matter of fact most everybody makes fun of you. It cant be the rest of the world. Oh sure you surf the net and find a website here or there that a person may post something that resembles what you preach, and then take it as gospel. Because you read it on the computer. That just goes to show how smart you really are. You feel free to pass out the insults and are down right combative to other members of this board. You cant even make a post not agreeing, without shooting a rude remark. As jena pointed out that must make you fell superior. You, yourself have made it open season on lords, by being so obnoxious to all. Like I said not one but two boards full of all kinds of different people that dont even know each other all cant tolerate you.

 come home from work today and my wonderful considerate child...says what did the retarded one have to say today? I told her she doesn&apos;t reply to me because she doesn&apos;t know how to insult without a complete story about the doughnut shop or some crazy story about this one time at band camp. And she has no manners and no moral upbringing. Please and Thank You are not in her mind it is just all about&quot;me&quot;.. I have shown Sara so many of her posts and always she says&quot;Mom, is she for real?&quot;At least she has the sense of humor and real world knowledge that she will make it big in this world where lords just needs to read up on manners and common curt. but wait why bother? She gets free food by stealing... so go ahead lords reply... give my well mannered sarcastic child a run for her money! By the way she will be graduating high school this year and also taking several college classes while doing so. She has ambition, she will support herself... not take from other people... imagine that! No I guess you can&apos;t because you don&apos;t have enough common sense or human compassion to think&quot;outside the bun&quot;

 Don&apos;t subject your poor daughter to her drivel coorsy baby! The poor child!

Shelter her for a bit longer. Hopefully she&apos;ll never have to come into contact with the likes of Lords. I don&apos;t think there are really too many people like her in the world, and that&apos;s good.

 Wow I obviously haven&apos;t read this post in a long time. Wow I can&apos;t believe my service is being compared to that of a McDonalds. You know it must be so tough as a McDonalds person because putting pre packaged ranch and ketchup and silverwear into a bag. Grabbing food and dumping it into a bag. And then woa this is the toughest, taking a cup and putting it under a fountain and pushing small medium or large. This can all be done with out moving very many steps.
I wish all the stuff I had to do could be done that quickly. My point of telling you all the things I had to do was to tell you that things are time consuming. It takes a lot more time to do those things in a restaraunt than at McDonalds. Sure the incoming to go order is absolutely important, but they are no more important that the people sitting in my restaraunt. I can&apos;t forget about them to take care of my to go order.

&quot;So if your going to stiff me for making your salad after I have not been able to take care of my other tables then I might be a little irritated.&quot;

WHY do you&quot;ONLY&quot;seem to care about your table&apos;s orders instead of EACH and EVERY customer&apos;s time? Just because the person gets take-out, doesn&apos;t mean they should not be just as IMPORTANT as the customers that are dining in.
My people in the restaraunt expect more out of me then a person with a to go order. I can&apos;t just give them there food and not show up until desert. They require more service.

&quot;I also have to ring all of your food up when you get there, and total it on the adding machine.(we aren&apos;t all high tech).&quot;
We are not McDonalds where when you take there order it is all completely done on a computer. You don&apos;t have to do any writing down or calculating. I do. When you have 20 people at a table who had apps, entrees, desert, and drinks it takes a little while, especially because I WANT TO BE 100% sure I have there bill right! Also at McDonalds most of the time the person who takes your order and takes your money is different from the other person who puts your food in a bag. This is to cut down on time because its FAST FOOD.
GET IT INTO YOUR TINY LITTLE BRAIN THAT FAST FOOD IS WAY DIFFERENT FROM A RESTARAUNT!!! OKAY? Can you even admit to that a little bit?
