No Trans Fat, No Grease, No MSG

At Lo-Fatt- Chow Chinese restaurant, we realize that healthy eating is not so easy and can be even more difficult when you and your family wish to dine out. Many families dine out 3-4 times a week because of hectic schedules. Many restaurants unfortunately too often serve a &quot;super-sized&quot; portion, few fresh vegetables, loads of trans/saturated fats, and just way too much sodium.
Lo-Fatt-Chow has addressed all of these issues and more because we are consumers too and they are a concern to us as well. Read more...

Customer Reviews
 My boyfriend and I went there yesterday and absolutely LOVED it.
 We ordered off the lunch menu, both getting wonton soup, chicken and broccoli, and brown rice. The wonton soup was GREAT. Not to salty, and the wonton&apos;s made out of 75% chicken were delightful . rrsals, July 08, 2008
