 Sun 12/18/11 04:30 PM Within your journey of living healthier, weight loss, maintaining, or even toning. What&apos;s been the hardest part to over come?

For me it&apos;s been giving up sweet&apos;s and fast food. Or eating out and settling for the healthier choices on the menu instead of caving into what I&apos;d really like to have. It&apos;s been training my mind that I eat to live instead of living to eat.   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 04:38 PM It&apos;s the chocolate gingerbread funnel cake that is sitting on my kitchen counter courtesy of some very adorable carolers. =)

The food journal really helped me a lot. Any time I have back slid and NOT kept a food journal I totally jacked everything up. I have worked insanely hard to retrain myself to let go of the fast food, to give up the sodas, to ignore the sweets and persistence has finally paid off. I have a MAJOR sweet tooth and that temptation is just about my worst enemy.   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 04:42 PM When I started gaining weight 6 years ago I thought the trigger was my dad, mother and father in law passing. This past year the biggest obstacle I have over came is that I am responsible for gaining the weight and eating poorly and not them. I always used grief as an excuse. I have worked out almost everyday since Easter, my food is good 85% of the time and thats all me, nothing to do with them. I have taken back my life and love it! You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 04:42 PM Controlling portion sizes. I think it&apos;s actually my *only* challenge - everything else has been pretty easy.   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 04:45 PM Overthinking.

I learned that I don&apos;t need to care what anybody else thinks or look for a right way to eat. I just need to use common sense and make sure I stay active. If I&apos;m not trying to be&quot;good&quot;and let myself eat whatever I want, I&apos;m less likely to obsess over certain foods and will only eat them when I really want them and not every time I happen to see them.   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 04:52 PM Motivation may have been there for me: Wife, children, those that need me to be healthy and around for longer

The OBSTACLE (yes, it is BIG), was in my MIND ...

The thought that I can&apos;t do this or can&apos;t afford or this might happen if I ....

The push past that was I had to... I just HAD to change my thinking. 30-40 years of BAD THOUGHT PATTERNS being undone. They are, in fact, REPLACED with good ones. Ones that say I CAN, I WILL and I DONT CARE what that person thinks, etc. And the big one - I&apos;M WORTH IT !

I am still fighting and MyFitnessPal&apos;s are backing me up ! They see me fighting and I hope they benefit from my wins ! Edited by gazz777 on Sun 12/18/11 04:53 PM You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 05:04 PM I was informed by my specialist that I have some very strong food sensitivities that are causing my metabolic disorder.... those foods are now on the &apos;must never have&apos; list - and they are:

Potatoes
Rice
Pasta
Breads
Corn
White Flour
Bleached any-type flours
Full Fat Dairy (clarified butter is ok on occasion) and most dairy products must be significantly limited.

Bread and pasta were the number one hardest to kick. I never realized how much of an addiction I had for these two food items!!!!!

But, I feel so much better..... and the weight is melting off!   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 05:14 PM Processed sugary foods and especially ((Twizzlers!!!))

My body was addicted to the sugar rushes these foods gave me, I loved the gritters and the highs. It took me till a month ago to start eating complex carbs without worrying about having to ween myself off that sugar high, even though I know they wont give the sugar high feeling I was still afraid. It was so hard getting all that out of my system and convincing my body it is not what I need or want.

Now I can even eat chocolate. I make sure it is after a larger meal, that way I don&apos;t over eat and don&apos;t get the rush associated with it.
Your comment about the cheat days, it was hurting this process for me, that is why I never did them.   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 05:16 PM My biggest obstacle was portion control. If there are any leftovers on the counter after dinner, they call my name.
I have had to resort to the healthy choice steamers for dinners. Proper portions and I have the calorie count right on the package.
This has helped to keep my blood sugar down as well as dropping pounds. You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 05:25 PM My biggest obstacle was exercising. I used to live an active lifestyle, but then I stopped and did nothing for many years. Weight dropped off me easily when I first started...simply because I lowered my calorie intake and started making better food choices. But then I plateaued, and knew I had to start exercising. Problem was that because I sat around so long, it really hurt to get moving, yet if I didn&apos;t get moving I would continue to hurt. I walked regularly throughout the summer and fall, and now I do zumba like at least 3 times per week. But it is still hard for me to just pick up and start exercising. Purchased turbo fire, and expecting some Jillian Michaels dvds for Christmas, so hoping these will keep me moving, losing and toning during the winter.   You are ignoring this user undo

 Sun 12/18/11 08:53 PM When I was at my heaviest weight weighed in (396 lbs) I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetics (665 sugars) High blood pressure (170 over 120 or vice versa), high cholesterol (320), sleep apnea. I was told if I didn&apos;t lose weight I wouldn&apos;t live another 6 months. That was almost 10 years ago. I made it down to 310 then my birth mother passed 4 years ago and I went back up to 330 lbs. I then got back down to 290 lbs and I had to have surgery on my shoulder (torn rotator cuff). Now I&apos;m healed and back again. I went from 326 lbs back to where I am now (290) as of last Monday and hoping to be down to 288 at the most. I have had a few times falling but the most important thing is no matter how many times I fall, I get back up even stronger. GOD BLESS!! You are ignoring this user undo
