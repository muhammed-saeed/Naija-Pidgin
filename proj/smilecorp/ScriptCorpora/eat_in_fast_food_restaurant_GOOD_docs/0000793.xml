       Since the far left has taken over the country, and is hellbent on turning it socialist and quite possibly bankrupt, it&apos;s probably a good idea that we take a closer look at liberals and liberalism. I&apos;ve come across some good articles that give insight into their mindset. Be forewarned, you might find such thinking disturbing.

We&apos;ll start our research with the account of a former liberal. What better way to get into the mind of a liberal than with a tour given by a former liberal...

 Ask Robin: A Recovering Liberal Addresses Some of Your Burning Questions 

By Robin of Berkeley

American Thinker&apos;s resident recovering liberal answers readers.

Dear Robin:

How can we trust that you are really who you say you are? How do we know you are not a liberal impersonating a conservative?

Marty


Hi Marty:

Busted! My articles are actually ghostwritten by Bill Ayers.

Don&apos;t sweat it, Mart-T, my conscientious editor at American Thinker, a Bay Area guy, has met and vetted me. So I&apos;m for real. Anyway, dude, do you think I could make this stuff up?

* *

Dear Robin:

What draws otherwise smart people to being a progressive liberal? How do they accept the generalized hate?

Julia


Hey Julia:

Let me speak for myself here.

My liberal turn on&apos;s: (This is like Match.com)

1. It was exciting: I was a bored, lost suburban kid growing up in a secular Jewish home with no direction to speak of. I spent too much time alone watching TV. My parents were heavy drinkers and partiers, and my brother hated me from the day I was born and made my life a living hell. So, it wasn&apos;t a blast, and when I got into my teens, I numbed it all out with drugs. Doing political work in young adulthood, I suddenly had a purpose, a reason to get up in the morning. Working with others in groups, marching with thousands of people, was not only an emotional high but a physical thrill, almost like an aphrodisiac. A legal high. And feeling like you&apos;re saving the world is positively orgasmic.

2. The Left is seen as cool. The Right is viewed as stodgy, dull, and selfish. Franken is cool. Newt is not. And many of us drawn to the Left were unpopular, lonely children. By being far left, a bunch of misfits can fit in.

3. It was all I knew. Info in Liberalville is censored and you believe what you hear. It becomes a form of brainwashing. And everyone around me was Left. We&apos;re pack animals and tend to follow the herd, for better or for worse.

4. Being progressive (what a high falootin&apos; word) makes you feel good about yourself: generous, altruistic, ever loving and accepting (even though they wish terminal diseases on conservatives). &quot;We can save the world, rearrange the world, it&apos;s dying to get better.&quot; (Crosby, Still, etc.) Who can argue with that ego trip:?

OK, now for turn off&apos;s:

1. Frankly, there have been a lot of things that have bugged the crap out of me for years (maybe this was why it was easier for me to wake up). The rampant street crime and aggressive panhandling are totally out of control. And liberals excusing antisocial behavior (&quot;He didn&apos;t mean to beat the living daylights out of that little old lady, he is a victim of white privilege, blah blah blah,&quot;) makes me want to hurl. They need their own recovery program for mega codependency (LibCo?).

2. The Left portrays itself as mellow and chill, but bigger control freaks you have never seen in your life. The Berkeley laws are draconian. Try finding a parking lot since none are available; cars are the devil&apos;s handiwork. The city restricts business licenses (again, to keep out those bloody cars) so I had to open my office in a nearby town. And light up a cigarette and watch a menacing crowd encircle you; Berkeley has outlawed smoking in almost every outdoor locale.

I can go on and on. . . But you get the point. Big Brother is alive and well in Berkeley, though he&apos;s traveling high on the hog via Air Force One these days.

3. The mean stuff. I just don&apos;t do mean. Love Ellen, Detest Janeane. Even when I was a liberal, I was nice one (by Berkeley, though not Alabama, standards). And my spiritual faith compels me to treat others with respect. But even though I&apos;m nice, I&apos;m not sweet. I don&apos;t put up with crap. But I&apos;m generally nice about it.

So, looking back, the seeds of conservatism were in me all along. And when I got older and wiser, the party got meaner and greener (don&apos;t get me started on the green fascism out here). I can&apos;t speak for every liberal but this is my tale. In the end, humans are rather simple creatures. We stay with the familiar until it becomes unbearable and we have another option. Liberalism didn&apos;t work for me anymore. Let&apos;s hope many others reach the same conclusion by 2010.

* *

Dear Robin:

I don&apos;t forgive you. You indoctrinated our young people.

Phil


Yo Phil:

No worries. I never worked at the university or any other schools. And, anyway, you don&apos;t have to indoctrinate people in Berkeley. Everyone drinks from the same Kool-Aid.


* *

Dear Robin:

Ooh, get me a tissue box. You and your readers are weak.

Sam


Hey Sam:

I have three responses to your letter. One: it&apos;s offensive and unseemly to mock my readers and me.

Two: your being so hostile to strangers makes me sad. Clearly one or both of your parents disrespected you and trampled on your feelings.

My upbringing was like that so I can relate. But I responded by never wanting to inflict the same type of pain on others. Take my word for it, Sam. It&apos;s much cooler to be kind.

Third: Bro, it&apos;s my party and I&apos;ll cry if I want to.


* *


Dear Robin:

You couldn&apos;t have been a liberal because you have a sense of humor.

Liz


Hello, Lizzy:

Funny you should say this! My motto in life is an old Wavy Gravy quote (no I wasn&apos;t at Woodstock): If you don&apos;t have a sense of humor, it&apos;s not funny!

The Left has become way too serious and sanctimonious for my tastes. But it wasn&apos;t always that way. I recently rented the first season of Maude, a show I enjoyed in my youth. I was astonished at how Maude, the white liberal, is affectionately teased throughout for her preachy white guilt. When she goes shopping for a &quot;maid&quot; (that&apos;s what they called them then), she insists on hiring a black one to &quot;help&quot; some needy person. When the confident Florida shows up, Maude is so condescending that Florida quits. Florida explains, &quot;I&apos;d rather work for a racist than a white liberal because at least racists won&apos;t try to change me.&quot; They reconcile, of course, and Florida is a major player on the show, reflecting back to Maude her patronizing ways. The lesson back then to whites: lighten up and laugh at yourself. And be very careful that your crusade for social justice isn&apos;t just another form of white arrogance.

If this show ran today, it wouldn&apos;t have lasted one episode (the Left would have rioted). And yet it was a runaway hit in the 1970&apos;s. Watching it bummed me out. How far we&apos;ve come, or we&apos;ve sunk, courtesy of the Thought Police. And liberals say conservatives are uptight and boring!

(By the way, there&apos;s a new summer replacement comedy called The Goode Family on ABC on Wednesday at 9 pm which pokes fun at the liberal, PC Police. Irreverent and refreshing. I give it a month at best before the network pulls it in fear of the wrath of Big O.)

Later. . . Robin

 A frequent contributor to American Thinker, Robin is a recovering liberal marooned in Berkeley and a psychotherapist in private practice. . She&apos;d like to thank American Thinker readers for their helpful, generous, and kind comments.

       Do Liberals Crave A Master? 

By Andrew Thomas

 Everybody&apos;s looking for something...
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree? - Eurythmics 

Contemporary liberals, having abandoned the belief in God-given inalienable rights, masochistically crave a worldly master. This master is a sadistic god-substitute who will provide the stern discipline needed to force economic equality and &quot;fairness&quot; by requiring painful sacrifices and bestowing government-created rights onto obedient and acquiescent groups of left-leaning masochists.

Of course, I am not referring to the sexual variety of masochism, but rather the recognized psychosis of moral masochism. Large segments of the population, and even entire nations can suffer from this illness as described in Daniel Rancour-Laferriere&apos;s book, &quot;The Slave Soul of Russia: Moral Masochism and the Cult of Suffering&quot;.

First, some re-definitions: In the same derogatory fashion liberals refer to contemporary Conservatives as &quot;neocons&quot;, I will label this group as &quot;neolibs&quot; going forward. I feel this is appropriate, as the Liberal movement has taken a decidedly leftward leap and become more radicalized in their outward behavior in the last few years, and is therefore a new phenomenon.

In most conservative writing (Thomas Sowell, Ayn Rand, and more recently Mark Levin) the common theme is the sanctity of individual freedom and liberty. The conservative is an individualist and an independent thinker, as opposed to those who primarily identify themselves as members of a group. The term &quot;conservative&quot; is a misnomer for this philosophy, as it connotes a preservation of the status quo, or even a &quot;regressive&quot; yin to the &quot;Progressive&quot; yang. This is why I believe a more appropriate label for conservative philosophy is &quot;individualist&quot;, and I will refer to it in this manner for the remainder of this article.

Next, a pop-psychology primer: individualists gravitate toward existential thinking, or a view of the world where individuals have complete freedom of choice and take full responsibility for the results of those choices. This mandates that choices must be made with a logical evaluation to determine the potential consequences. The impartial evaluation of phenomena to determine the truth is an offshoot of existentialism known as phenomenology. The phenomenologist is rational and emotionally detached from the subject of analysis, eliminating judgment and perception. Once the perceptions of reality are stripped away as much as possible, the phenomenologist then attempts to perform an insightful analysis of the object to determine what is real or &quot;true&quot;. I believe that many individualists tend to be effective phenomenologists due to their ability to separate themselves from group-think and emotional judgment. Therefore, let&apos;s use the phenomenological process to analyze the &quot;Neolib as masochist&quot; theory.

In our first analysis, we will impartially examine Neolib behavior. Objectively listen to Janeane Garofalo in the Youtube video linked to her name. In listening to neolibs such as Janeane speak, it is evident that they appear to be driven predominantly by emotion rather than logic. Just reviewing an alphabetical list of emotions, as extracted from a list in Wikipedia, lends itself to describing neolib behavior:

Anger,
Angst,
Anxiety,
Compassion,
Contempt,
Despair,
Disgust,
Empathy,
Envy,
Guilt,
Hatred,
Hope,
Hostility,
Hysteria,
Rage,
Shame,
Suffering,
Worry.

Anyone who views the world through these emotions would naturally feel threatened when interpreting individualists&apos; behavior. The neolib typically projects hatred, bigotry, selfishness, and greed onto the individualist when there is no physical evidence to support the interpretation. The strong passions exhibited by neolibs, coupled with delusions of persecution, foster these masochistic tendencies.

Now let&apos;s objectively review the initiatives in the neolib agenda: Environmentalism, global passivism, overpopulation, socialized healthcare, and promoting government intervention into all aspects of life. All of these priorities require individuals to sacrifice their lifestyles, their income, and/or their basic comforts.

This past week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi exhorted, &quot;Every aspect of our lives must be subjected to an inventory...&quot; in order to sacrifice ourselves to the gods of global warming. As presidential candidate Obama said, &quot;We can&apos;t drive our SUVs and, you know, eat as much as we want and keep our homes on, you know, 72 degrees at all times...&quot; He seems to indicate that he wants us to starve and freeze.

Most of these initiatives involve the inflicting of pain and misery. Tom Daschle, in his book &quot;Critical: What We Can Do About The Health Care Crisis&quot; says health-care reform &quot;will not be pain free&quot; and that seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of having them treated. In other words, you will suffer a slow agonizing death under government mandate.

As a final phenomenological exercise, impassively observe the level of neolib support for this agenda. It has not appeared to wane. In fact, neolib fervor continues to increase as the promised level of suffering increases.

According to Rancour-Laferriere, increasing Russian masochism coincided with the rise of the Soviet Union and Communism, although it was pervasive in the soul of Russia prior to that. The conclusion to this analysis is that as neolib moral masochism increases, so does the emotional need for an all-powerful master to govern them. As the governing master becomes more dominant and disciplinarian, the masochism is reinforced and the spiral continues.

Is there a cure? Self-destructive behavior is very difficult to overcome. Many years ago in an Abnormal Psychology class, I studied the case of a group of young adults who would continually pound their heads against a wall until they became bloody pulps. Psychologists found that the only thing that would interrupt their behavior was a 9,000 volt shock from a cattle prod.

This is probably an impractical solution. Since 45% of the nation thinks we are going in the right direction, there are too many neolibs and too few cattle prods.

       I don&apos;t know if Liberals want a master, but the do want a savior.
They see what they define as problems, and want someone to fix it - to save them from this peril.

To a Liberal, the government is the solution to whatever problem you have.
If something&apos;s not right, it must need regulation.
If it moves, tax it.
If it stops moving, subsidize it. 

 
 maryjane MSG #4 , 06-03-2009 08:19 PM 
       Pretty long reads and I will admit I just skimmed over them, but going too far in either direction is never a good thing. While in a case of one extreme being predominat--the opposite certainly offsets it somewhat, I believe over the long term, it is better to have a very large majority somewhere closer to the center. That way, both sides benefit, and neither gets harmed much. Having a paradigm that is so far to either side, that constitutional questions abound daily, is counter-productive over the long haul..

       Letter of Amends from a Recovering Liberal in Berkeley 

Dear friends, family, loved ones, conservatives, Republicans, libertarians, my brother in law, Sam, and my cousin Joe: I am sorry and you were right.

These are not easy words for anyone to utter, much less a leftist from Berkeley, or a recovering leftist, that is. Even though I&apos;ve been in recovery for 14 months, 2 weeks, and 3 days, leftists are always right in your face, in an I-hate-you-if-you-disagree sort of way. Hence, this letter of amends to all the people I&apos;ve lectured, scolded, ranted and raved at, and otherwise annoyed during my 30 plus years of &quot;progressive&quot; politics.

My recovery program urges a fierce moral inventory, a cleansing of heart and mind (kind of like a &quot;forgiveness tour&quot; but without the scary dictators), so here goes:

To my brother in law, Sam, for blasting you in that Chinese restaurant for voting for Reagan, mea culpa.

To my cousin Joe for calling you a traitor when you became an MBA, started holding a real job (as opposed to most of us Berkeley types who are psychotherapists, massage therapists and aromatherapists), and became a conservative, my bad.

To my goddaughter whom I told when she was l0 years old that Republicans were bad, Democrats were good (yes I really did say this), and who got confused and tearful because she lives in a suburb where most people are Republicans, kid, what in the world was I thinking?

To my leftist friends, with whom I agreed that 9/ll was the US&apos;s fault, you and I were all such jerks.

To those potential friends whom I dumped when I found out you were conservative, your gain is my loss.

To all those columnists and editors whom I harangued with angry letters and e mails, sorry, sorry, sorry.

And finally to me, Robin, for installing you for the last 27 years in the far left cult of the People&apos;s Republic of Berkeley, where Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the SLA, where the Black Panthers had their violent beginnings and the heads of the Black Muslims are jailed for murder and rape, my apologies, girl.

I didn&apos;t know any better. I thought the whole world lived in areas where the streets are filthy, aggressive street behavior is allowed because the perps are victims of capitalism, and where you can easily get mugged walking down a street or eating in a restaurant at noon. (By the way, with the Left in charge, expect gangs, crime, indoctrination of 5 year olds and general anarchy to be coming soon to a neighborhood near you.)

Given that the media is pretty much censored (good luck finding a conservative book in your local &quot;independent&quot; book store or hearing a Republican speak anywhere), you didn&apos;t know that a party of grown ups even existed that didn&apos;t advocate screaming at others as the preferred mode of communication. So to my dear Robin, apologies for what I put you through, what I deprived you of, and my pledge to do better.

Cousin Joe, Sam, et al, you may be wondering how I did a l80 in 1 1/2 years. How did I go from a rabid, sanctimonious liberal whom you steadfastly avoided at family gatherings to a fan of Limbaugh, Hannity, and Savage? Recovery encourages us to share our story, so here&apos;s mine:

In February of 2008, I saw a new client, a bright and sensitive young woman who came in looking like she just escaped a war zone. In some ways she had; she had innocently shared with others at her job that she voted for Hillary rather than Obama. Immediately she was being targeted for abuse that put her in fear for not only her job, but her life.

We both suddenly became aware that something had grown really dark in the Democratic Party. I started hearing about many other incidents where loyal Democrats were being physically and emotionally threatened for supporting Hillary. A woman in Berkeley had her front window broken because it displayed a poster of Hillary. Randi Rhodes, an Air America talk show leftist, called Hillary a f______ witch. (Rhodes was recently promoted to a national talk radio show, illustrating another disturbing trend: the deafening silence about what Rush Limbaugh has dubbed the new &quot;thug-ocracy.)

An acquaintance had her car broken into, and the only item stolen was a NoObama bumper sticker. A South Park episode featured an episode where a nuclear weapon was being aimed at Hillary&apos;s genitals. My local greeting card store sold very flattering cards about Obama, insulting ones about Hillary, and a Hillary &quot;nutcracker.&quot; When I complained, the young male manager literally laughed in my face.

Things went from bad to worse when Sarah Palin entered the scene. When Geraldine Ferraro ran for Vice President, there was no debasement of her character, no sexual threats. But with Palin, a full scale &quot;wilding&quot; ensued that chillingly reminded me of the random sexual attacks on women by gangs of men in New York. She was called every vile name in the book by both male and female liberals.

Actress Sarah Bernhardt hoped a gang of black males would rape her. When Palin&apos;s church was torched with children inside, the press was missing in action (somehow I imagine the press would have been all over this if Obama&apos;s church were torched). Not only was the misogyny disgusting, but the classism was abhorrent. The Democrats, by ridiculing Palin&apos;s voice and her education, were acting like arrogant snobs. The party had changed, I had changed, and the differences looked irreconcilable.

The final straw for me was when a close friend flew into a rage at me when she learned I wasn&apos;t supporting Obama. The political became personal when she began impugning my character. Worse yet, she tried to intimidate me into changing my mind by threatening to dump me.

Suddenly a light went on. The peace and love and flower power of the old left was dead and gone (if it even existed to begin with except in my imagination). The Democrats had morphed into a power hungry Thought Police, and I was done with them. My new motto in life: don&apos;t PC on me.

So this is my letter of amends, and I hope that I can be forgiven by all whom I&apos;ve offended. I knew not what the heck I was doing. But now the problem is: how in the world does one be a conservative these days? How to stay brave and committed when conservatives are being targeted, punished, and shunned on a daily basis? How to sleep at night knowing that the country I have finally come to love may be destroyed from within by a massive Big Brother government?

I guess I&apos;ll just have to do a step one, as we 12 stepper&apos;s call it, and turn it all over to my Higher Power.

Love,

Robin

It&apos;s not that all leftists are exactly the same, it is just that you people want exactly the same. Same goes for the right.

Leftists want surety.

Rightist want liberty.

I believe that leftism is just the weakest of the choices. It is definably for weak-minded, non-working, pansy ass parasites of our society. Are all leftist like that? No, but most are.

The Law Liberals Always Break
By C. Edmund Wright

There&apos;s a law that liberals always shatter. (And no, I&apos;m not talking about tax law.) It&apos;s the law of unintended consequences. Actually it&apos;s not so much liberals per se that break it so much as it seems liberal thinking by definition always runs afoul of this law. Leftist policy always hangs itself if given enough rope.


The liberals now have the entire stage with a very liberal President, extreme leftists in control of Congress, and the main stream media. Liberal failure has nowhere to hide and no one to hide behind. So as the Obama administration attempts to attack the country&apos;s economic woes, they find themselves stepping in one pile of liberal policy do-do after another. You might say that the left hand doesn&apos;t know what the left hand is doing. The world will have to watch as liberal policy for problem A destroys Obama goals for problem B and so on.


Consider: with Obama, Reid and Pelosi screaming for the country to accept a ridiculous stimulus package to create jobs, jobs, jobs -- liberals in Chicago are standing in the way of a Wal-Mart Super Center that would bring in construction and retail jobs to the messiah&apos;s hometown. By the way, liberals will also keep the lowest cost provider of food and clothes and home goods from being accessed by hurting Chicagoans.


The reason? The liberal principle of protecting union jobs at all costs. Remember, behind every economic disaster is a powerful union. And sometimes a community organizer.


Which leads to another example. Union jobs at the big three auto makers have been supported for years by the high priced and high profit SUVs and pick up trucks. Of course, liberal environmentalists have long made the SUV a target, while limiting domestic energy production. Greenies are doing everything they can to destroy the SUV, and with it, many union jobs, and almost succeeded during the last energy price spike.


Oh, and should we mention the fact that those oil rig jobs that pay a ton of money to mostly union members cannot be had here thanks to drilling restrictions in this country? The Russians and Venezuelans send their thanks to American liberals.


But it gets better. This contradiction, which has been predictable for anyone with some linear thinking ability, has escaped the minds of millions of Michigan voters educated by the liberal-controlled public school system. They have for decades voted for politicians illogically holding pro-green yet pro-UAW positions simultaneously. Voters of that very liberal state have no one to blame but themselves. They voted themselves out of an economy over a period of years. This is the state where Obama went to pick up a good share of his economic advisors. No wonder it is home to the Detroit Lions.


Meanwhile, back in Washington and New York, liberals in Congress and in the media are having a field day chastising corporations for buying jets, hiring contractors to renovate posh office suites, and giving big bonuses to executives.


Well guess what? Buying jets, hiring upper end contractors and giving bonuses stimulate the economy. It is job friendly. And that&apos;s what we need now, right? Oops. More liberal fertilizer. Liberalism simply cannot get out of its own way. Especially hurt is lefty New York, where the economy is reeling from a number of factors.


But of course, the liberal tenet of wealth envy is paramount to common sense. And apparently, to jobs. Speaking of which, if you break down the Starbucks corporate jet issue, it is especially delicious with unintended consequences.


The coffee purveyor, you remember, was mercilessly raked across the media&apos;s coals for taking delivery on a 45 million dollar jet while it was closing stores and laying off barristas. So they cancelled the jet order.


Think about that. Starbuck&apos;s deposit on the jet was lost, which is foolish under any circumstances. Further, that jet is now back &quot;on the showroom floor&quot; so to speak, reducing by one the need to manufacture such planes. So to keep some &quot;hamburger flipper&quot; type jobs that liberals make fun of, many high paying jet manufacturing jobs were lost. The only thing stimulating about that equation is the Starbucks caffeine.


And we could go on like this simply with stories from today&apos;s headlines. It&apos;s a fact of life. Liberal policies in action always cave in on themselves. They always have.


Take liberal Neville Chamberlain and his appeasement of Hitler in the 30&apos;s. We must have &quot;peace in our time.&quot; How did that work out? It took a violent victory, not a phony peace, to bring lasting peace. The peace effort led to a stronger Hitler and ultimately millions more deaths than &quot;war mongering&quot; policies would have led to.


Look back at 9-11. Some thirty years of liberal policies regarding intelligence gathering, intelligence sharing and prosecuting terrorists led to an attack that killed three thousand Americans in, well, two of the nations&apos; most liberal cities. You cannot say this in polite company, but statistically some 90% of the victims likely voted for the policies that led to the dreadful day. Shhhhh.


Think about abortion. The feminist movement has called this a women&apos;s issue. It is defined as the ultimate right for women. Fine. The result? The most likely fetus on the planet to be aborted is a female in China. That&apos;s women&apos;s rights we can believe in, right? Talk about the circle of life -- er -- death.


Consider school choice. This issue is demagogued by the teachers&apos; unions above all else. These are unions who are obsessed with raising teacher pay. What would be the teacher pay result of a broad school choice program? It would be the equivalent of &quot;free agency&quot; for good teachers and administrators. Think about what free agency has done for pay for athletes. Another circular liberal firing squad in action.


Take California&apos;s government cash meltdown. The main culprit is retiree benefits for unionized government workers in the state. And of course, the result is that current unionized government workers are being laid off, furloughed and not hired. More liberal on liberal crime.


And let&apos;s not forget Europe and their coddling of Islamists for decades. Their payback is a near takeover of European society by gangs and street violence, not to mention ridiculous rules and regulations in airports and schools and other public places.


Liberalism&apos;s failure is universal because liberalism embraces a false view of human nature as perfectible, if only the right political arrangements exist . And it would be funny, except that the consequences are so devastating to so many people. And so often the victims are the very liberals the policy was supposed to protect.


The only good news is this: with liberal Democrats front and center on all stages governmental now, they will be opposed by a much more formidable foe than a Republican President and a Congress dying to just get along. They will be opposed by the obvious truth of their bankrupt philosophy.

Bush didn&apos;t ignore it. He tried to fix it.

 quote On Sept. 11, 2003, the Bush administration proposed to Congress a new agency under the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie and Freddie. The new agency would have had the authority to set capital-reserve requirements, veto new lines of business and determine whether the two quasi-government lenders were adequately managing the risk of their ballooning portfolios.

When former Treasury Secretary John Snow pleaded for Frank to support Fannie and Freddie reform, Frank responded: &quot;These two entities — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — are not facing any kind of financial crisis. The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.&quot; 
 


Essentially, Bill Clinton&apos;s directive to push changes to the Community Reinvestment Act, which forced banks to lend to people who couldn&apos;t afford the loans, and when GWB tried to remedy the situation, Barney Frank and Chris Dodd stood in the way. And those very people who blocked the fix are in charge of this current attempt, as well.

And the CRA was a Carter Administration construct. So, in short, the deadly triple play on our economy goes Carter, Clinton, Frank, Dodd. End of the ball game.

You&apos;re wasting your time with the facts. They never fly for some reason unless you&apos;re talking to other conservatives. Somehow virtually the entire media in this country failed to report on the Barney Frank and Chris Dodd situation, and I don&apos;t recollect anybody bringing up the changes the Bush Administration suggested except on the net.

yup. so, what was the amount of these loans? bah - nm.
so, greed is liberal? because from what I see here, it was the personal greed of your two poster boys here, not anything to do with &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;. but, I fully understand if it is impossible to think beyond &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;. but, its fine to make excuses. I am sure we can trot out many greedy folk from both sides who create messes to fuel there own greed.

yes = conservative

I&apos;m not sure you&apos;re using the appropriate definition of &quot;conservative&quot; in all honesty. Conservatism is not all about religion and moral issues- but it gets painted that way.

Merriam Webster defines it this way:

 Main Entry: con·ser·va·tism
Function: noun
Date: 1832

1 capitalized

a: the principles and policies of a Conservative party

b: the Conservative party

2 a: disposition in politics to preserve what is established b: a political philosophy based on tradition and social stability, stressing established institutions, and preferring gradual development to abrupt change ; specifically : such a philosophy calling for lower taxes, limited government regulation of business and investing, a strong national defense, and individual financial responsibility for personal needs (as retirement income or health-care coverage) 
3: the tendency to prefer an existing or traditional situation to change 


While I see your &quot;point&quot; in calling those you listed &quot;conservative,&quot; you are pretty much narrowing it down to just the &quot;existing tradition&quot; concept. There&apos;s a lot more to it than that, and conservatism does not go hand in hand with religion any longer in my book.

I think that much of that perception is a carry-over from the issue, that primarily the media made, of christian evangelicals gravitating to the Republican Party in 2000 and 2004.
&quot;Family values&quot; voters were also lumped in with the evagelicals, even though, for many of them, their particular concerns were for schools, preservation of the nuclear family, and other issues that are not necessarily religious or even &quot;evagelical&quot; in nature.
Christian &quot;evangelicals&quot;, while welcomed to the GOP largely due to their strong belief in traditional moral values, certainly never comprised the majority of *conservatives*, nor solely defined conservative political ideology.
The carry-over we see today is the assumption that any group with strong religious beliefs, *must* be politically &quot;conservative&quot;.
The dichotomy between the &quot;conservative&quot; political stances taken by protestant &quot;evangelicals&quot; and the liberal political stances taken by many devout Catholic groups in the U.S. , (i.e. illegal immigration),*should* be enough to give lie to that assumption, yet it seems to persist.
How liberals can equate conservatism to any kind of theocratic ideology is even more mystifying when one considers, by example, that most true conservatives while favoring *allowing* prayer in public schools would at the same time abhor the idea of *mandating* it.

 Oakland reportedly mulls bankruptcy filing 

hip Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle reports that Oakland, California is considering a bankruptcy filing, which would make it the Golden&apos;s State&apos;s largest city (so far) to declare itself unable to pay its bills.

&quot;We have asked the (bankruptcy) question because we wanted to know the impact,&quot; said District 5 council member Ignacio De La Fuente. &quot;In closed session, the question has been asked, and an answer was given.&quot; He would not elaborate.

&quot;It&apos;s a possibility,&quot; he acknowledged. &quot;Things are that bad.&quot; [...]

Consider the city&apos;s cash position: Out of next year&apos;s general fund of approximately $415 million, police costs are estimated at $212 million, fire protection service $103 million and $41 million in debt service payments. That leaves about $60 million to pay for everything else, from library services to recreation centers to public works.

And that calculation doesn&apos;t include $50 million more in deferred debt service in a budget proposal presented to the council last month by Mayor Ron Dellums.

Johnson reports that if federal funds are not secured by Oakland, up to 200 police officers will be laid off, among other measures. In a city hosting such a large population of violent criminals, that could be a catastrophe. A very fine journalist, Johnson notes that municipal employees in California have had quite a run the past few decades, with wages and especially benefits that are the envy of private sector workers.

       My Imaginary Friend 

By Robin of Berkeley

American Thinker&apos;s recovering liberal learns the true meaning of conservatism

When I was a child I had a pretend best friend just like me. She looked like me, talked like me, and had the exact same interests. I named her Robin 2. (I also named my stuffed animals by their colors, i.e. Whitey, Greyey, Pinky; what can I say? I wasn&apos;t the most creative of tots.) I must have been influenced by my favorite TV show, the Patty Duke Show. (For you young&apos;uns, it was a wholesome show (they all were back then) about identical twin cousins, both played by the adorable Ms. Duke.) When my mom took me to the store, my friend came too. She&apos;d sleep with me, eat with me, and keep me company when I was sad.

As I got older, I had live best friends, but none fulfilled the promise of Robin 2. My real friends and I would get into nasty fights and not talk for days. Girls can be so cruel; I remember a group ganging up on me and starting an &quot;I Hate Robin Club&quot; replete with posters and banners. Luckily it didn&apos;t last (though, given that I still remember it, clearly the trauma did). Even as I got older, I still maintained the fantasy of having a sister type of best friend who, unlike my real older brother, wasn&apos;t making ruining my life her raison d&apos;etre.

Last week, on a grey day when I was home nursing a cold, I thought about old Robin, about how nice it would be to have a best friend I could really talk to. I&apos;d been feeling a bit sorry for myself lately being a conservative in Berkeley. My friends adore Obama; my clients talk excitedly about him all the time; even the random stranger in front of me at the supermarket is talking up Obama. So it&apos;s all Obama, all the time, and I feel like crawling under a rock. I don&apos;t dare reveal my true feelings since I don&apos;t want my clients to run screaming from my office or to have another friend throw me under the bus.

My husband is a type of best friend in a way that a guy can be (when I&apos;m upset or sad he goes and fixes something). But he has no idea what planet I&apos;ve just returned from, politically speaking. For example, he recently told me he heard Obama speak and that, &quot; Obama has a great sense of humor.&quot; I repeat: the man said, Obama, o-b-a-m-a, the man with the thinnest skin on the planet, has a great sense of humor. Stunned into silence, I finally sputtered, &quot;I guess we have different presidents,&quot; and he agreed, looking at me perturbed, as though I had just said, &quot;An alien kidnapped me last night and impregnated me with his love child.&quot; So let&apos;s just say my man and I are still close but we avoid politics and both think the other is delusional.

A little loopy from the Nyquil, I wondered what would be the harm of a middle aged, newby conservative resurrecting her childhood pretend friend. (Yes I know it&apos;s weird, but people in downtown Berkeley chat with their invisible buds all the time.) Bored with Oprah and Ellen, I decided to envision a reunion with Robin 2.

me: It&apos;s so great to see you!

robin 2: Right back at you! Girl, you look fantastic.

me: You too. You haven&apos;t changed one bit since I saw you.

robin 2: And I have never seen anyone, anywhere age as seamlessly as you.

It was great having Robin 2 back! She was fun, lively, supportive. She was, in fact, me!

me: I have missed you so much. There&apos;s no one like you.

robin 2: So what&apos;s been up with you all these years?

me: Oh, sis, it&apos;s been a wild ride. I live in this insane area and I&apos;m a psychotherapist, and I was politically Left all my life but recently turned Right. It&apos;s a bit dizzying to talk about.

2: Wow, you really changed. What happened?

me: It&apos;s a long story but basically this really angry scary dude Obama ran for president and he and his cronies destroyed the competition and they continue to mow down anyone who gets in their way. I couldn&apos;t go with the program so I read about conservatism, and it was totally different than I thought. It&apos;s about values, and morality, and love of country.

2: Sounds a little old fashioned and stodgy.

me: Not at all! Actually, liberals with their insistence on being politically correct at all costs are the uptight ones. Conservatives value individual freedom.

2: I don&apos;t know. It just doesn&apos;t sound young and cool and with it.

me: (with annoyance) Robin 2, we are not young and cool. We are no spring chickens, and it is time to grow up and take our place as society&apos;s elders.

2: (sarcastically) I don&apos;t think so.

me: It&apos;s natural to become more pragmatic and logical as we get older, and less driven by emotions.

2: I think we can change the world.

me: I used to believe this, but then, I finally got it. Only God can do the changing. When humans try, it turns into arrogance, social control, even fascism.

2: But we have to hope! We have to believe!

me: Robin 2, what in the world has happened to you? I invented you. You are my twin. But you are not like me at all. You are (I gasped) Obatomized!

Then I noticed it. The girl had snuck in a gallon of Kool Aid, and was drinking wildly, madly. Just like we used to sneak in weed and boys when we were teens, the rascal had brought in some Obama love potion #9.

And when she uttered these words, I knew the gig was up, &quot;And anyway I think Obama is hecka cool. I just love the brother. He&apos;s all about love and hope and joy. And, the cat has a great sense of humor.&quot;

In an instant, I knew what what I had to do. I had to say goodbye to my old friend. The image of unconditional love was fading as fast as the effects of the Nyquil. But just then, I had an epiphany. Why do I need people to mirror me anyway? Why this relentless focus on what others think of me? Could it be just some throwback from decades of liberalism, the Kumbaya image of eternal love?

I say I&apos;m a conservative who believes in individual freedom. But being a conservative isn&apos;t just spouting words. It means being a free individual, getting off of my high horse and standing on my own two feet.

Just then, I thought of a Far Side comic I kept in my drawer for years. A black lamb is beckoning to other, white, lambs to go in another direction. He cries out, &quot;We don&apos;t have to be just sheep.&quot; And I got it: when you have the truth of your convictions, you must sometimes stand alone. Perhaps this is one of the definitions of maturity: to stand upright and separate from the herd, even if you end up being the black sheep.

&quot;We don&apos;t have to be just sheep.&quot; Perhaps that&apos;s my cry, the battle cry of all of us conservatives who do not want to become sheep, who refuse to take the Obama pledge and do the Obama salute and worship at the altar of Obama.

So given the choice between pleasing everyone and freedom, I choose the latter. I may not win any popularity contests anytime soon. But maybe that&apos;s not the point of this one short, precious life.

yes - I know - I am just sick of the blanket stereotyping. at least when it doesnt involve Negro&apos;s 

and - yes - that is much of why I put it that way - because the way these left/right extremists talk - it is like you are commiting blasphemy, and should be burnt at the stake. well, at least on one side - the other, burning produces greenhouse gasses - and I guess will put you in the dunking chair or squish between rocks.

and yes - Obama and his followers. holy crap. but, I suppose if they turned it into a cult, and it worked, might as well jump on, and creat the counter cult, eh?

this &quot;for us or against us&quot; crap is completely nuking what once was a good thing. bust the republican&amp;democrat unions. let issues stand on their own merit - not on the merit of who proposed them.

This connection of being conservative to being a money meister is simply wrong. That part I do find questionable.

 
 


True. Here&apos;s proof...

 Obama, a “Sort of God”? 

On Friday evening Newsweek editor Evan Thomas had an extraordinary exchange with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. Thomas, commenting on Obama’s Cairo speech, said, “I mean in a way Obama’s standing above the country, above — above the world, he’s sort of God.” And when Thomas was asked by Matthews, “Reagan and World War II and the sense of us as the good guys in the world, how are we doing?” Thomas replied:

Well, we were the good guys in 1984, it felt that way. It hasn’t felt that way in recent years. So Obama’s had, really, a different task. We’re seen too often as the bad guys. And he — he has a very different job from — Reagan was all about America, and you talked about it. Obama is “we are above that now.” We’re not just parochial, we’re not just chauvinistic, we’re not just provincial.

These comments reveal several notable things.

The first is that it is now impossible to mock the media’s adoration for Obama. In the past, if conservatives had said that MSM commentators viewed Obama as God, people would have assumed they were exaggerating in order to make a point. But in this instance, there is no exaggeration; Thomas stated that Obama is “sort of God.” It appears as if in their unguarded moments, Thomas and those like him really do view Obama as the Anointed One, a political Messiah, not only a gift from heaven but the Creator of Heaven and Earth.

Keep in mind that Thomas is viewed as a serious journalist for what was once seen as a serious mainstream publication: Newsweek. Now Newsweek long ago set aside any pretense of objectivity when it came to Obama; every week it takes up palm branches for him. Still, it is a bit jarring to see the bias so obvious, so up front, so proudly out in the open. In that respect, Thomas’s comments are useful; they reveal a cast of mind that no one can now deny.

No political figure in modern American history has been so adored by the press. JFK came closest — but even he was not deified, even in death. The depth and intensity of the passion for Obama among the press is something young children need to be shielded from.

A second thing to note in Thomas’s comments is his assertion that “we [the United States] were the good guys in 1984, it felt that way.” Well, it might have felt that way to many conservatives. But to many liberals, it was actually something very nearly the opposite. It’s worth reminding those on the Left with selective memories that Reagan was mocked and ridiculed as a dangerous figure, trigger-happy, a war-monger, reckless and provocative. His support for the Nicaraguan contras, his build-up of America’s defense, the installation of Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe to counteract the Soviet deployment of SS-20s, and Reagan’s talk about the Soviet Union as an “evil empire” unnerved and infuriated liberals.

“I wonder how many people, reading about the [”evil empire”] speech or seeing bits on television, really noticed its outrageous character,” Anthony Lewis wrote in the New York Times in March 1983. “Primitive: that is the only word for it. … What is the world to think when the greatest of powers is led by a man who applies to the most difficult human problem a simplistic theology — one in fact rejected by most theologians?… What must the leaders of Western Europe think of such a speech? They look to the head of the alliance for rhetoric that can persuade them and their constituents. What they get from Ronald Reagan is a mirror image of crude Soviet rhetoric. And it is more than rhetoric: everyone must sense that. The real Ronald Reagan was speaking in Orlando. The exaggeration and the simplicities are there not only in the rhetoric but in the process by which he makes decisions.”

Commentators like Lewis and magazines like Newsweek had contempt for Reagan’s approach; it is only now, after history has vindicated him, that we’re supposed to believe we all supported Reagan and that Americans were seen as “the good guys.”

A third important thing to take away from Thomas’s comments is why Obama is so beloved by some reporters and commentators. Reagan, Thomas says, was “all about America.” But Obama is “above that now.” He is “standing above the country” he was elected to represent. And in doing so, we’re not just “parochial, we’re not just chauvinistic, we’re not just provincial.”

That is an extremely and probably unintentionally revealing set of comments by Mr. Thomas. For the president to speak on behalf of his nation as Reagan spoke up for America is viewed as unsophisticated, narrow-minded, and bigoted. Obama, in the eyes of his supporters, has transcended such things. According to the logic of Thomas, Obama deserves to be praised precisely because he does not, in the first instance, represent America. At his best, Obama is a “citizen of the world,” standing “above the country.”

Some of us have a different, quainter notion of such things. We believe America is, in the words of Lincoln, an “inestimable jewel” — an imperfect and extraordinary nation that deserves our affection and deepest attachment. We believe, as Lincoln and the founders did, that the fate of this republic is inextricably tied to the principles upon which it was founded. We actually do not want our President to “stand above the country.” And we do not believe it is particularly sophisticated to disparage as chauvinistic and provincial those who speak up for her. Nor, I might add, do we view Obama as “sort of God,” or anything close to God. The fact that Evan Thomas and those who view the world as he does, do see Obama in supernatural terms tells you everything you need to know, and probably nothing you didn’t know.

By your definition, every BACKWARD step taken by civilization has also been a LIBERAL step.

Your definitions are true as far as the dictionary definitions of liberal and conservative, but in practice the political definitions aren&apos;t split that cleanly.

The definition you use seems to only represent the concepts of &quot;change&quot; versus &quot;staying the same&quot; when there is a lot more to it- and in actuality, conservatives are not against &quot;change,&quot; but rather &quot;change without purpose or without thought.&quot; It&apos;s an &quot;if it isn&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it,&quot; not a &quot;no change for any reason.&quot; I&apos;m not saying nothing is/was broken by any means. Just that conservatism is not &quot;don&apos;t take that step.&quot;

And you bring up money way too often in reference to conservatism. That is exactly how the liberals want people to see the other side- as money hungry big whigs. Well, I don&apos;t have money, nor does my family. But we all work for what we have and don&apos;t ask for hand outs and government intervention in our lives. Conservatism is about earning your own way and taking care of yourself, not &quot;I&apos;ve got mine, don&apos;t change a thing.&quot; Nor does it say don&apos;t change anything without thinking. That is also an innacurate comment. It&apos;s don&apos;t change unless it&apos;s a good idea. That IS thinking.

Just my .02 cents.

well, to start with - earning your own way, and taking care of yourself is UNIVERSAL - it is not a &quot;quality&quot; of conservatives.

so - do conservatives think the lame&amp;crippled should be left to die? of course not, right? even tho they dont take care of themselves? or earn their own way?
what about auto insurance? do conservatives think auto insurance should NOT be required by all drivers? since that is government intervention?
we already know how they feel about health insurance. why one but not the other?

anyways - all I am trying to show is the ignorance of the stereotyping, and especially using it to taint what really needs to be done. you&apos;ll see it everytime - each side dismissing the other on the basis of over-the-top stereotypes. as you said - the money grubbing big-whigs vs the uneducated lazy. even tho - both of these are wholly wrong.

I urge people to read that article. It is probably going to spread throughout California within the next 20 years. I trust that &quot;Conservatives&quot; have the best interests of the environment in mind, even though stratagies may differ from viewpoint to viewpoint. Serious question, what would be your solution to the waste issue in urban areas?

In my opinion, a recycling program like this could easily (and should) be paid for through private industry. The idea of composting on a huge scale like is addressed in the article can not only provide agriculture with quality organic fertilizer, but can also produce energy from harnessing methane gas and geothermic energy.

The days of the city dump have been over for a while now. Most metro areas in CA use transfer stations where recyleable materials are seperated and sent out to different processors for recycling. Food residue on recycleable materials adds health risk to workers and processing costs are increased. It is not difficult to scrape stuff into a seperate container. If you don&apos;t want to participate in the process, feel free to get a garbage disposal, they have been around for ages now.

Sure.
How about instead of mandating that citizens provide free labor in sorting and cleaning debris for commercial recyling firms that nearly every community waste disposal system in this country contract with, you stop this pointless &quot;feel good&quot; nonsense and rely of the industrial sorting equipment that nearly all of these places already have in place.

Is Califonia so backward that they don&apos;t know what commercial recycling sorting equipment is?
Let me help them out...

My community has one of the country&apos;s largest operations that not only processes waste for recycling, but generates clean electric power from a closed system incinerator plant. Pretty state-of-the-art stuff really. This plant is just down the road from where we built our new medical products plant. I&apos;ve toured it a couple of times and watched the *automated* recyclable sorting process. Very efficient and fast.
 http://www.pinellascounty.org/utilities/wte.htm 

Our citrus industry here in Florida also recycles. Since the vast majority of Florida citrus is processed for orange juice concentrate, the rinds from the fruit are recycled as cattle feed, generating additional income for the citrus industry and providing a local source of feed for another big Florida industry, (Yes, Florida is a big cattle producing state as well).

Most of our waste water treatment plants also &quot;recycle&quot; the high nitrogen sludge that is left as the last of the wastewater treatment process. It is sold as an excellent high nitrogen fertilizer to ...guess who...the citrus industry.... and other agricultural businesses here in Florida, again generating a profit, (I know libs hate that term), for the community wastewater treatment facilities and again providing a valuable, yet inexpensive source of fertilizer for growers.

It&apos;s called free market, and when libs stay the hell out of the way business can , and will, resolve the problems to the benefit of many.

The folks out in Loopyland can continue scraping their granola into separate containers by hand and bashing capitalism and feeling good about their silly selves while they continue to go more broke than they already are.

Good Luck

Perhaps you could &quot;rationally&quot; explain how a law requiring people to sort garbage or face civil fines is somehow related to being paid for through private industry?
I see nowhere that you have expressed any opposition to the S.F. law that was the subject of the article.
In point of fact, your own comment: &quot;Food residue on recycleable materials adds health risk to workers and processing costs are increased. It is not difficult to scrape stuff into a seperate container.&quot; clearly is supportive of the S.F. law.
The liberal mind looks for more government control to solve every problem and control every aspect of people&apos;s behavior, (more laws, taxes and fines always seems to be the answer)
The conservative mind looks for opportunities to solve problems with the least government interference.
You say that you expect the S.F. initiative to spread across California in the next 20 YEARS.
I show you how the problem is being handled in Florida right NOW. (Without more taxes, laws and fines I might add)
The only thing you really regret about engaging &quot;people like me&quot; is that you didn&apos;t like the answer.

OK, I &quot;de-personalized&quot; my original post for you.
Now let’s talk about the facts.
Tell me how you can obviously support a law that fines people for not scraping off their dinner plate properly.
Tell me how you appear to believe that more government intervention to control even the simplest and most mundane aspects of individual behavior is appropriate.
Tell me exactly why the S.F. initiative should spread through California.
Tell me how “Food residue on recycleable materials adds health risk to workers…” but is apparently ok for workers handling it for composting???

Last, but not least, tell me how quoting a post I clearly made to someone else and then asking right below it if I have an answer to your question, isn&apos;t &quot;rude&quot; on your part.
Of course you&apos;re going to probably claim that you were simply asking if I had an answer, nothing more, but we both know full well how transparent that excuse would be, so before you try playing the &quot;victim&quot; you might want to examine your own behavior. I won&apos;t play to your double standard.

       I would like to know how I &quot;obviously support&quot; this initiative. First we should address an image that non Californians have. We do not all live in San Francisco. So regardless of my feelings about it, it won&apos;t make a difference as I don&apos;t have a vote in the matter. I live in a relatively conservative agricultural area. We are not all Berkeley.

Furthermore, I don&apos;t believe I ever showed any support, I just encouraged people to read the article for themselves before chalking it up to &quot;the loony left&quot;. &quot;Read the article.&quot; I believe that was the extent of my editorial. I did express an opinion. I have visited the transfer station in our area, and unfortunately I guess we are too backwards to have robot sorters that can seperate food from non-biodegradable materials.

Please try to stay focused Stimpy.

I answered your questions and now you answer mine,
That&apos;s the way this sort of thing works.

I&apos;ll repeat:

OK, I &quot;de-personalized&quot; my original post for you.
Now let’s talk about the facts.
Tell me how you can obviously support a law that fines people for not scraping off their dinner plate properly.
Tell me how you appear to believe that more government intervention to control even the simplest and most mundane aspects of individual behavior is appropriate.
Tell me exactly why the S.F. initiative should spread through California.
Tell me how “Food residue on recycleable materials adds health risk to workers…” but is apparently ok for workers handling it for composting???

Last, but not least, tell me how quoting a post I clearly made to someone else and then asking right below it if I have an answer to your question, isn&apos;t &quot;rude&quot; on your part.
Of course you&apos;re going to probably claim that you were simply asking if I had an answer, nothing more, but we both know full well how transparent that excuse would be, so before you try playing the &quot;victim&quot; you might want to examine your own behavior. I won&apos;t play to your double standard.

       Randy, as much as it would please you to fill my mouth with your words, I never said that I support any initiative, I never said that it should be statewide in 20, I said it probably will. That has nothing to do with my opinion on the matter. I don&apos;t like fines, apparently that is how society gets people to abide by it&apos;s laws. See speeding tickets.

As far as my request about if you have any opinion on solutions to the issue, you have your mind made up about my &quot;motivations&quot;. No matter what I say, you will insinuate that I am lying. So why don&apos;t you just go ahead and fill in the blanks for yourself. I am sure that you will be satisfied with your answer.

       Why Do Liberals Bleed? 

By Robin of Berkeley

I&apos;ve been thinking about learning how to fire a gun, maybe even buying one. Now if you are a lifelong conservative, Red State dweller, and NRA member, you might be thinking, &quot;Big yawn. What&apos;s next? She&apos;ll be telling us what she had for breakfast?&quot;

So let me try to convey to you the enormousness, the Alice in Wonderland quality of my even posing the question, something I&apos;ve never, ever considered in my life. No one I know owns a gun. I&apos;ve never seen a gun (well on a holster of a police officer but I never wanted to get up close and personal with it). I have given lots of good money over the years for gun control. Learning to fire a gun seems as ludicrous as deciding to take up brain surgery.

But, I am rethinking absolutely everything. There is not a single thing that I believed, that I held absolute and holy, that is not up for grabs. My brain is in a tizzy 24/7 and I don&apos;t know if up is down, or if east is west.

And the thought about a gun just came to me last week when I was listening to talk radio. A caller related how an armed citizen in the South stopped a take over robbery in a fast food restaurant. A light went on in my head. Suddenly I realized that the Red States may be on to something: the police are strongly supported, the citizens have guns, and, therefore, the gangsters may be a little reluctant to take over the local Burger King.

Contrast that to the Blue States where few liberals own guns, and the police are being emasculated. You may have heard of the horrendous case in Oakland where four cops were killed by a known felon, on a parole violation for child rape. But the powers that be in Oakland sent out the message to the police to make nice and not scare the populace, so the officers never drew their guns when approaching this felon. (Anyone else notice how the Left is slowly but surely disarming the police and military, situation-by-situation?) When I expressed my heartfelt grief to a friend about the deaths of these brave officers, he said, &quot;The man who shot them was a human being too.&quot;

(I&apos;d like to say that, as a psychotherapist, I responded in a sophisticated and psychologically crafty manner. No such luck. I almost blew a gasket, turned bright red, and said with barely contained anger, &quot;He lost his claim to be human when he raped a child.&quot; To the friend&apos;s credit -- and perhaps some fear on his part -- he shut up.)

So what I realized during the talk show is that in places like Berkeley, only the criminals have the power. Not only do they have the power of guns, they are supported by several thousand brainwashed zombies who give the green light to criminals because they are the victims of someone else&apos;s &quot;privilege&quot; and &quot;supremacy&quot; and &quot;imperialism.&quot; (Although I was a leftist until recently, I was the rare exception: I never excused crime because of the bad guy&apos;s race, creed, age, sex, or daddy being a meanie.)

I recall vividly what a Berkeley police officer once told me:

&quot;Berkeley is a city of victims. You try to understand the street people and the criminals and sit down and talk to them and then they hit you on the head and steal your purse. The police come and then you refuse to press charges. The criminals know this and prey on you.&quot;

And he&apos;s right: almost everyone I know has been a victim of some awful crime, from being in restaurants during takeover robberies (not uncommon here), to being robbed at gunpoint, to being assaulted for no other reason except a thrill for the assailants. A neighbor, who had lived all over the world, once said to me, &quot;Berkeley is the most dangerous place I&apos;ve ever lived.&quot; Her husband was robbed at gunpoint as were almost all her friends. She couldn&apos;t wait to get out of here.

I wish I could say I&apos;m an exception to the victim rule. But several years ago I was coming out of a restaurant in a decent area and was mugged. As Gavin de Becker states in his seminal book, The Gift of Fear, (which I, unfortunately, read after the fact), victims generally sense when they&apos;re about to be victimized but ignore the signs in order to be nice and not judgmental. This was my situation exactly. I could tell right away that the guy looked sinister. But it was a major street, at high noon, and I didn&apos;t want to seem racist, so I turned the corner a few feet to reach my car, and a minute later, had my purse stolen as well as all my feelings of being safe in the world.

I&apos;ll spare you (and me) the horrible details, but the incident ended with my having a broken nose and two black eyes, and needing surgery for the nose several days later. People wrote bad checks and stole rental cars in my name for a year afterwards. I developed a fear not only of people, but of the phone and the mail, as every day was another reminder of what happened.

Witness the response of a left wing friend, Judy, when I told her I was mugged. She said, and I quote, &quot;I don&apos;t think what you went through was so bad. And anyway he was a victim too.&quot; (Maybe it&apos;s a good thing I wasn&apos;t armed back then.)

So I&apos;m asking myself whether I should become armed, and I&apos;m also wondering why so many &quot;educated&quot; people (I might have just answered my own question) put up with crime infested streets? Why are the biggest protests against the cops? Why are the innocent viewed as guilty, and the guilty innocent? Why is no one up in arms about liberals literally bleeding?

Then it occurred to me: Stockholm Syndrome, the same brainwashing that turned Berkeley resident Patty Hearst into Tania the bank robber. She was tortured, sexually abused, and kept in isolation by the far left group, the Symbionese Liberation Army (kissing cousins of Bill and Bernadine&apos;s Weather Underground). Successfully brainwashed, she joined their twisted and sick &quot;army.&quot;

In the real Stockholm, the hostages were locked in a vault for days, came to &quot;love&quot; their captors in that perverted way that an abused woman loves her husband, and refused to testify against them in court. One even became engaged to her captor.

SS (good acronym, huh?) is rooted in a basic, primordial instinct for self protection in the wake of extraordinary trauma and terror. To survive, the victim identifies with the captors and merges psychologically with them. But SS takes on a life of its own when victims stop seeing their own humanity and want only to serve the abuser.

Living in places like Berkeley, being force fed propaganda, with police afraid to protect you, your friends unsympathetic, and no one armed, SS can spread like a virus. What starts out as compassion morphs into complicity. Occasionally there may be someone, like me, who snaps out of the trance they&apos;ve been in for decades. After all, Tania woke up and became Patty Hearst again and, interestingly, married her bodyguard. (I bet that they own a whole lot of weapons.) But she had to leave Berkeley for a leafy, sheltered life elsewhere to do this.

But then again, I never bought into the notion of collective guilt, that groups of people are guilty because of the color of their skin, and individuals are exonerated because of some protected victim status. I&apos;m the rare bird. In Berkeley, most people are so over identified with their ideology, that their logical, questioning minds have flown the coop along with a God-given knowledge, possessed by every 5 year old, of right and wrong.

As a good, loyal liberal, I always expected others to take care of me. If I gave my unqualified loyalty to the system, I could sleep well at night. But now, with victims left bleeding, a dangerously naive government, and sheep like masses, I see the absurdity of my thinking.

I heard a philosopher once say that one of the biggest existential tasks of life is giving up the fantasy of the ultimate rescuer. Liberalism reinforced this fantasy for me, as it does for so many others. Now I see the truth: We come into this world alone, and we will leave it alone. When we live our lives in the back seat of the car expecting Daddy to drive us, we only have a child&apos;s view of the world.

On that very dark day in November years ago when I became an object of someone&apos;s evil and inhumanity, I glimpsed a truth I never wanted to see: that there really is no protection, not in the way I had always thought, not by other flawed humans. I didn&apos;t know what to do with this insight until 1 1/2 years ago when I discovered that there were others out there like me, that there was something called conservatism, and now slowly but surely the pieces are coming together for me, one by one.

As I continue on the path to independence and personal responsibility, perhaps looking to myself for protection is another step on my journey.

This made me think of quotes from the Movie &quot;Batman Begins,&quot; where the character played by Liam Neeson who is training Bruce Wayne how to fight says:

 &quot;Crime cannot be tolerated. Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society&apos;s understanding.&quot; 

and

 &quot;There are those without decency who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.&quot;

       &quot;A Liberal is a Conservative who hasn&apos;t been mugged yet.&quot;

I would just hope that in her consideration for learning how to fire a gun and considering buying one she takes the time to decide if she could ever take another human life. If not, that gun won&apos;t protect her and may end up causing her more harm.

It is a tool. A tool that is only helpful when properly used. She needs to make sure she&apos;s not buying it and viewing it as her protector the same way she viewed the system. Having a gun doesn&apos;t protect you. YOU have to protect yourself. The gun is only one possible tool in your arsenal.

       Liberals: Wolves in Sheep&apos;s Clothing 

By Lloyd Marcus

I still remember the knot in my stomach upon seeing the sea of white faces from the window of our school bus. It was the first day of school 1961. We came from a neighboring black community, about a hundred or so of us, to the newly integrated white Jr/Sr high school with thousands of students.

Everything intimidated me, the massive school building, being around whites for the first time, feeling small, seventh grade school work (would I measure up) and my stutter.

The night before, I shared my fears with my preacher dad. Dad gave his typical answer, &quot;Trust God&quot;.

Someone grabbed me from behind. It was an angry older white teacher with a crew cut. He spun me around and almost pressed his wart-covered nose against mine. In my haste to find my homeroom, I went the wrong way on the stairs. Stammering and scared, I tried to explain that I was lost. But he refused to listen and carted me off to the principle&apos;s office. There I sat on my first day, a &apos;problem kid&apos; and late for homeroom.

However, things did get better. Mr. Gomer, my art teacher and Ms Hornet, my English/creative writing teacher recognized my talents and nurtured them. Still, I felt pretty invisible at Brooklyn Park Jr/Sr High in Maryland.

The popular black students in the mostly white school were athletically and/or academically gifted. I was neither.

Then something wonderful happened. Every month, the best four art pieces from the entire school art classes were displayed in the lobby. My paintings were selected numerous times. This was not Affirmative Action. My paintings were displayed solely based on merit.

This achievement helped me to realize I had talent. It dramatically impacted my self esteem and life. I won scholarships to art college and enjoyed an award winning career as a television Graphic Designer.

But what if my school had embraced a liberal mindset so prevalent today? &quot;EVERY child should experience the feeling of having their artwork displayed in the lobby. It&apos;s only fair&quot;. If every student&apos;s artwork was displayed, it would have robbed me of the knowledge that I possessed above average artistic talent.

Liberals frown upon individual achievement. I heard a news story about a kid banned from Little League pitching because he threw too hard. Rather than welcoming an opportunity to raise the game of the batters, Liberals chose to force the gifted pitcher to lower his game. Many schools even ban the keeping of score at sporting events. Typical, touchy, feel-ly, let&apos;s not cause anyone to feel bad, liberalism.

God forbid kids learn that sometimes you win, sometimes you lose and these experiences make you stronger! It&apos;s called life! It&apos;s how we grow. Without failure, you would never experience the joy of success.

Some of you may be thinking, &quot;Why is Lloyd always ranting about liberalism&quot;? Folks, I have witnessed the devastating effect of liberalism in my own family. A forty something drug addicted cousin is a serial impregnator with several out of wedlock children. And yet, he enjoys a new townhouse, food stamps, free health care and methadone all funded by working taxpayers. In essence, the government is enabling and funding my cousin&apos;s irresponsible lifestyle.

American taxpayers are extremely generous, sympathetic and more than willing to help those in need of a hand up. But liberal cradle to grave government dependency programs kill incentive and ultimately hurt people.

Here is another example of how touchy feel-ly liberalism overrules common sense and what is best for people. Without question, to move economically forward in America, it is most beneficial to speak English. Those who do not are stifled and stuck in minimum wage jobs. And yet, any politician courageous enough to merely suggest that immigrants learn English is crucified for racism.

Meanwhile, frustratingly, Conservatism gets the bad press branded as mean and heartless.

Conservatism 101: A Tale of Two Dads by Lloyd Marcus.

Little Johnny hates school and does NOT want to attend. Liberal dad says, &quot;I know how you feel. I hated school also. There are bullies, kids who think they&apos;re hot stuff and it is just too HARD! You can sleep as long as you like&quot;.

Conservative dad says, &quot;Jonathan Matthews (and his last name) you get your rear end out of that bed this instant and off to school. Why? Because I SAID SO and it is best for your future! And also, because I LOVE YOU!&quot;

Lloyd Marcus is Singer/Songwriter of the &quot;American Tea Party Anthem&quot; and President, NAACPC (National Association for the Advancement of Conservative People of Color).

       One more liberal gets it 

Ed Lasky

James Kirchick writes for, and is the assistant editor of, the liberal The New Republic and also wirtes occasionally for Commentary Magazine. Today, in the New York Post
he writes of the betrayal of Israel by Obama, and the shaping of public opinion against Israel:


This dramatic shift in American policy began several months ago when the administration signaled that it would make the cessation of Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank the centerpiece of its policy to revamp the region. And that approach, mostly hinted at through anonymous leaks, became as good as official when Obama delivered his vaunted address to the Muslim world in Cairo earlier this month. In that speech, Israel (and, specifically, its policy of settlement construction) was the only state to merit specific criticism from the president of the United States. Among all the degradations and injustices in the Middle East, from the abhorrent treatment of women in nations like Saudi Arabia, to Syrian-backed assassinations of pro-sovereignty politicians in Lebanon, to the arrest and imprisonment of gay men in Egypt, the leader of the free world singled out America&apos;s one, reliable democratic ally in the region for rebuke.

Obama&apos;s strategic worldview assumes that once the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved, other problems in the Middle East will be easier to fix, if not solve themselves. &quot;We understand that Israel&apos;s preoccupation with Iran as an existential threat,&quot; National Security Advisor Jim Jones told George Stephanopoulos last month. &quot;We agree with that. And by the same token, there are a lot of things that you can do to diminish that existential threat by working hard towards achieving a two-state solution.&quot;

By establishing this connection, the fate of the entire region thus hinges upon the resolution of a problem that hasn&apos;t had a solution for over six decades. This is an awfully convenient view for those who enjoy the status quo, which is why so many Arab despots cling to it, and it&apos;s discouraging to see the Obama administration joining them.

Every time Obama and his minions (Biden, Clinton) use the phrase that a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is in “ the national security interests of America” or the “national interest” of America he plants a seed in the mind of America that 9/11 was caused by American support for Israel and that any violence towards America from the Muslim world is motivated by American support for Israel. He has made it a meme and it is proliferating. No American President-including George H.W. Bush, ever coined this particular phrase-one that Obama has repeated ad nauseam for months.

       On a related note, this explains a lot...

 Confessions of a Lapsed Atheist 

Do you believe in God? Really? And you&apos;re willing to admit it in public?

Oops. Sorry, for a moment I slipped back into the arrogant Atheism of my youth.

Before my parents had children, they decided to raise their kids in a secular home. We had gifts at Christmas time and chocolate covered matzoh during Passover, but there was no religion and certainly no God.

When I was in grade school, God was just a kind of nondescript character who popped up in Little House on the Prairie books from time to time. He seemed like a decent enough fellow, but was more or less a bit player who didn&apos;t have much to say.

After my grandfather died when I was seven, his Baptist minister lifted me up in his arms and told me, &quot;It&apos;s all right, Grandpa&apos;s with God now.&quot; At that moment, I could feel my dress was hiked up in the back and all I could think about was pulling it back down. But later, I asked around and discovered that God was our Heavenly father, whatever that was supposed to mean.

I figured, who better to ask about my Heavenly father than my earthly father, but when I did he laughed.

He wasn&apos;t amused in a &quot;kids say the darnedest things&quot; kind of way. He was laughing derisively at the idea that my mother&apos;s family believed in God. And thus began my introduction to Atheism.

There are people who call themselves atheist who are simply nonbelievers, and then there are the big &quot;A&quot; Atheists for whom Atheism is almost a religion. This quasi-religious doctrine isn&apos;t neutral on the existence of other religions; rather, Atheism is a virulently anti-theistic creed characterized by sneering contempt for religion and a profoundly dogmatic bigotry toward people of faith.

Want to know how Atheists see the rest of us?

I grew up learning from my father that Atheism is rational, and therefore, religious belief is irrational; Atheism is defined by logic, religious faith by fantasy; and science is real while religion is make believe. Faith, I was taught, requires a willful stifling of reason.

The Torah, the Gospels, the Qur&apos;an? All woefully inaccurate, laughably inconsistent fictions used to encourage belief in an illusion for the purpose of social control.

My curiosity in religion surfaced again in seventh grade when several of my friends were planning Bat Mitzvahs. Surely my friends weren&apos;t ignorant enough to actually believe in God, were they? The answer was no. For most of these Reform Jews, this celebration marked the official end to the tedium of Hebrew school. Most of their families were Ethical Culturists with a recreational interest in preserving their Jewish cultural identity. In other words, they too were Atheists.

By the time I reached high school, having had little contact with religion, I was convinced that people of faith were credulous and unenlightened. They gravitated toward soothing tales of God and afterlife to help them deal with their own mortality. At best, I considered belief in God an anachronism, a quaint vestige of days gone by, on par with superstitions about wicked thoughts causing birth defects.

At my extremely liberal college, I was exposed to even more militant Atheism. It was there that I learned the mere whiff of religiosity is worthy of denigration. Many of the people I met approached religion with something between disdain and loathing, and considered all religious belief a form of fanaticism. Christians in particular were characterized as knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing fundies (and that was in polite company.)

Fortunately my mother taught me enough manners that I kept my bias to myself.

In this new environment, my Atheism was more than evidence of good reasoning, it was a socially desirable badge of intellectual superiority. Make no mistake: Atheists think they&apos;re smarter than you. Atheism isn&apos;t simple skepticism. It is a certainty that believers are wrong, and by extension, intellectually inferior. Religion, especially Judeo-Christian religion, is nothing more than a crutch for dupes.

But Atheists aren&apos;t content to leave religion as a mere object of ridicule. They want it cleansed from public life. And enlightened as they are, they&apos;ve come up with quite the pretense for justifying the righteousness of their bigotry: they are defending the vision of our Founding Fathers from a dominionist conspiracy to establish Christianity as the state religion.

You see, for liberal Atheists, the only thing worse than religion is the Religious Right, a term they use to encompass all Christian conservatives. And what better way to siphon fuel from the Religious Right than to convince Americans that the government is perpetually on the verge of becoming a theocracy?

And so, they accuse local governments of trampling the Constitution in the name of God and they find subliminal Christian iconography in political ads. They wring new meanings from Thomas Jefferson&apos;s notion of separation between church and state, and condemn our country&apos;s motto and the status of Christmas as a national holiday. But above all, Atheists stoke fear among religious and nonreligious alike that conservatives view government as a tool to force religion down your throat.

Pope-slandering buffoon Bill Maher, something of a patron saint among Atheists, has called religion &quot;the ultimate hustle.&quot; Last fall, Maher&apos;s fellow liberal Chris Matthews, a self-described Catholic, roundly criticized Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for talking about prayer in a &quot;secular environment&quot; and complained that she made the Republican Party look more like a church tent than a big tent. In March, Matthews complained, &quot;Why does everything sound like the &apos;700 Club&apos; with this Party now?&quot; Such examples of anti-religious bias can be found every day on cable news, network television, and in the pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post.

As my politics strayed right of center after college, I realized I wanted no part of that Maher/Matthews worldview based in elitism and the ridicule of others. I made the transition from Atheist to atheist to agnostic, and have since discovered why it is often said that religion is experiential.

There was a time when I would have preferred any manner of torture to admitting the possibility of a higher power. These days, I&apos;m proud to say I lost my faith in the Atheist creed.

T&apos;s Recovering Liberal Responds to More Burning Questions

Dear Robin,

I&apos;ve read all your articles and find them self indulgent, like you are doing some sort of personal therapy. It&apos;s not conservative at all.

L


Hi, L:

It&apos;s nice of you to take the time to read my articles since clearly they are not your cup of tea.

Let me explain: memoir writing is very popular, though only in liberal circles. It&apos;s deeply personal, and usually irreverent, witty, and wise. True masters of the genre include Anne Lamott, Elizabeth Gilbert, and Augusten Burroughs. Memoirs are one of my favorite types of writing because I enjoy being drawn into the author&apos;s life, and I admire the fierce honesty and vulnerability.

I know of no conservative authors who write this way. So I am making a stab at telling my story using this genre. My new conservative friends, especially my professional writer pal Virginia, have been urging me to write for some time. It&apos;s what I can do during these dark times.

I aim to share my experiences and psychological insights in as honest, entertaining and informative way as I can. I&apos;m very grateful to my amazing editor at AT for thinking outside the box and publishing my work. Personally I think we need a big tent and should mix it up with all sorts of creative writing. Either I am filling a need out there for nonliberal memoir writing, or it won&apos;t work. To paraphrase Winston Churchill: if I fail, I&apos;ll do so with great enthusiasm.


Dear Robin:

Why don&apos;t you distinguish between liberals and leftists?

KD


Yo KD:

Good question. There used to be a real difference. Like your odd ball cousin twice removed, the hard Left was on the fringe. But the Left has implanted microchips in the brains of most liberals (metaphorically speaking), and now they sound as Left as can be. To test my theory, say the words &quot;George Bush&quot; and also &quot;conservatives&quot; to your local liberal and watch them foam at the mouth like a rabid dog. I can only speak of Blue State Liberals. Perhaps those in the Red States haven&apos;t lost their marbles yet.


Dear Robin:

Can you explain why liberals are so angry?

Jen


Hi, Jen:

Puzzling, isn&apos;t it? You&apos;d think that since liberals have won big time, they&apos;d be sitting pretty, chilling on the couch, all happy clappy. Instead, they&apos;re acting like angry victims of &quot;the man.&quot;

Why is this? You don&apos;t have to read much further than Saul Alinsky, Obama&apos;s role model. Alinsky taught disciples to foster resentments, agitate people, and create paranoia. He preached ridiculing and intimidating all opponents, especially reasonable people. His mission -- and I think the goal of the Powers that Be -- was revolution so that the haves were on the bottom, and the have nots were in power.

By the way, did you know that the dedication on the first edition of Rules for Radicals read as follows, &quot;To the very first radical, the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did so so effectively that he won his own kingdom -- Lucifer.&quot; How creepy crawly is this? Once the book was a hit, the dedication was expunged from later editions. It makes me think of a line from a Bob Dylan song, &quot;You have to serve somebody. It might be the Devil or it may be the Lord but you&apos;re going to have to serve somebody.&quot;

For the average Joe to inflict cruelty on another, he has to trick himself psychologically into thinking he&apos;s doing good. There are defense mechanisms employed, rather primitive ones like dissociation. He dissociates from his humanity and the humanity of the other. He represses his human urge to empathize and protect. He projects his self hate and shame onto the other person. Just look at what&apos;s being done to good Christian women like Carrie Prejean and Sarah Palin. Most people know deep inside that making rape jokes and wishing decent folks harm is contemptible. So they turn it around, demonize the other. and delude themselves into thinking they&apos;re right.

Lastly, to control people, the power structure uses addiction. Our masses are fed addictive technology, media, highly sugared food, antidepressants, and illegal and psychotropic drugs. Anger itself is addictive. It feels powerful, and stimulates feel good chemicals like adrenaline.

Now liberals will balk, arguing that conservatives are being mean too. But the crucial point here is that liberals are in power. When underlings at a job gripe about the boss, they are letting off steam. When people who hold the power act like schoolyard bullies, that&apos;s dangerous. That&apos;s the slippery slope into sadism and fascism. We might already be there.


Dear Robin:

You are a fake. Obviously you have always been a conservative and are pretending to be an ex liberal.

RJ

Dear Robin:

You&apos;re a phony. Clearly you are still a liberal pretending to be a conservative.

Jim


Hey RJ and Jim:

Actually you&apos;re both right. I&apos;m a liberal and a conservative. I&apos;m also an actress, a neurosurgeon, and the oldest living exotic dancer. The truth is that I suffer from Multiple Personality Disorder.


Dear Robin:

Very good memoir writing. However, saying liberals &quot;worship at the altar of Obama&quot; is clearly a nonobjective exaggeration that is stated as a fact and not a personal perspective. . . &quot;

Clarity


Hi there Clarity:

Thanks for the compliment.

You know I could have instead written, &quot;Many liberals greatly admire Obama, and are extremely devoted to him, &quot; but, my friend, that would be BORING! I&apos;m trying to animate my readers, not put them to sleep.

Plus, let&apos;s be honest here. if I had McCain&apos;s smiling mug splashed all over my T-Shirts, car, walls, windows, and owned life size cardboard dolls (I&apos;ve seen several of Big O out here), and if I said stuff like, &quot;McCain is special. I think he&apos;s like Lincoln and FDR and maybe even God a little, and that he was freed from his POW camp because he has a special mission in this country and the world. When he speaks I get a chill up and down my legs,&quot; wouldn&apos;t you consider me &quot;McCain-atized&quot;?


Dear Robin:

Do you believe you are more, or less, compassionate as a conservative than you were as a liberal?

Bernie


Hey Bern:

Interesting question. My dictionary defines compassion as a feeling of sympathy and concern for all. So if that were the yardstick, I&apos;d say I&apos;m not as compassionate. I have little sympathy for the guy on the corner with his wee-wee out, screaming that I&apos;m a stupid ***** . To me, people should earn compassion and respect through their behavior. I think that the Left confuses compassion with codependency, which I define as the three C&apos;s: Controlling, Caretaking, and Changing others. I always thought that conservatives were meanies and that liberals were the compassionate ones. Now I&apos;ve realized that you do people no favors viewing them as helpless victims that require rescuing.


Dear Robin:

Just what we need, an ex cocky liberal turned neuvo cocky conservative.

Roy


Hey Roy:

Oh, my gosh, did you just call me &quot;cocky&quot;?! Be very careful, my friend. I am now a protected class. According to the Thought Police, the word cocky is an insult to womyn, and will be punished harshly. Remember, first they&apos;ll come for us. Then they&apos;ll come for you.


Later. . . .Robin

       A story from the Globe and Mail that illustrates that Liberalism is a mental disorder not only limited to the US. Meet the new Liberal Prime Minister in waiting, Michael Ignatief. In it, the writer talks about the liberal leader&apos;s view that the drunken indian who sent his kids outside on a cold winter night last winter,dressed only in diapers, only to freeze to death was not a murder, but rather a victim of white oppresion.

.lgagnon@lapresse.ca

The story of Christopher Pauchay is well known. It&apos;s been recounted in the media across the country. Before we see what kind of sappy tale Michael Ignatieff made of it, let&apos;s recall the horrible events that unfolded during the night of Jan. 29, 2008.

Mr. Pauchay, a resident of the Yellow Quill reservation in northern Saskatchewan, left his house in the middle of the night as a blizzard was sweeping through, driving the temperature down to -50. He apparently wanted to go to his sister&apos;s house - the reason is unclear since he was extremely inebriated and lost track of what happened.

In any case, he took with him his two girls, aged 15 months and three years, dressed only in T-shirts and diapers. Outside, he lost his way and eventually dropped the girls in the snow.

He somehow managed to get to a nearby house, where he passed out. His daughters were found many hours later, frozen to death. Mr. Pauchay, who has been sentenced to three years in jail - a merciful sentence - had already been convicted of 52 other offences, including assault on his wife.

Now let&apos;s see how Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff describes these events, in the introduction of True Patriot Love, an otherwise interesting essay about his maternal ancestors and his own dreams about Canada.

&quot;Imagining what we share is not easy. Imagining this land is never just to imagine it as it appears to you alone. It is to imagine it as an Inuit person might see it ... To imagine it as a citizen is to imagine it as a resident of Yellow Quill reservation in Saskatchewan would have had to imagine it, this Canada where two half-naked children died in a snow-covered field in the subarctic darkness because their father tried to take the sick little girls to his parents and never made it, and all you can hope is that death was as mercilessly quick as the cold can make it. What does a resident of Yellow Quill imagine, what do we, Canadians, imagine our country to be, the morning we learn that children have perished this way? It is surely more than just a tragic story of one family. It is a story about us.&quot;

 In this melodramatic reinterpretation, Mr. Pauchay is turned into a devoted father who is a victim of &quot;Canada&quot; (&quot;it is a story about us&quot;).

There is no mention of alcohol consumption, nor of Mr. Pauchay&apos;s own responsibility in the death of his daughters, who, under the pen of Mr. Ignatieff, seems to have been hit by some mysterious calamity, like a sudden avalanche.

This is an acute case of the syndrome brilliantly described by French writer Pascal Bruckner in Le Sanglot de l&apos;Homme blanc - about the self-hating, teary-eyed White Man who carries on his shoulders all the sins of his ancestors and who ends up patronizing and dehumanizing the people of the Third World (in this case the aboriginals) by refusing them the status of responsible adults. 

Mr. Ignatieff&apos;s reinterpretation of the Pauchay story wouldn&apos;t be worth a second thought if he weren&apos;t leader of the Liberal Party and possibly Canada&apos;s next prime minister.

The Liberals have already promised to act on the Kelowna Accord, negotiated under former prime minister Paul Martin, which would transfer some $5-billion to aboriginal communities for purposes such as health, housing and education. One wonders whether an Ignatieff government would make certain that the first nations chiefs are accountable to their communities and to the taxpayers about the way they use the money.

Under Jean Chrétien&apos;s government, Indian Affairs minister Robert Nault tabled a bill aimed at introducing some basic democratic rules into the governance of the reservations. The bill was forgotten as soon as Mr. Martin came to power.

He was so eager to please the leaders of the first nations that he gave them everything they wanted: a great deal of money with no strings attached. It would be regrettable if Mr. Ignatieff followed the same path.

       More Americans See Democratic Party as “Too Liberal” 

PRINCETON, NJ -- A Gallup Poll finds a statistically significant increase since last year in the percentage of Americans who describe the Democratic Party&apos;s views as being &quot;too liberal,&quot; from 39% to 46%. This is the largest percentage saying so since November 1994, after the party&apos;s losses in that year&apos;s midterm elections.

 

Most major demographic and attitudinal subgroups show at least a slight uptick since 2008 in perceptions that the Democratic Party is too liberal. The increasing perception of the Democrats as too far left comes as President Obama and the Democrats in Congress have expanded the government&apos;s role in the economy to address the economic problems facing the country. Additionally, the government is working toward major healthcare reform legislation and strengthening environmental regulations.

...

Implications

The Democratic Party continues to hold the upper hand over the Republican Party in the current U.S. political environment by a variety of measures, including party identification and party favorable ratings. However, compared to last year, Americans are significantly more likely to see the Democratic Party as too liberal, and as a result, they are somewhat more likely to view the party as being too far left than to perceive the Republican Party as too far right. That may expose a bit of a vulnerability for the Democratic Party, and if perceptions of the Democratic Party as being too liberal continue to grow, the GOP may be able to win back some of the support it has lost in recent years. But that may be possible only if the Republicans are at the same time able to convince the public that they are not too far to the political right.

 How Politicians Bankrupted California 

As the end of California&apos;s fiscal year approaches, the Governor and state legislators confront a $24 billion deficit. While Republicans and Democrats wrangle over how to address the gaping shortfall, some members of the press have started to look for a scapegoat for the fiscal train wreck. Many have blamed the California taxpayer&apos;s only protection: Prop. 13, the 1978 measure capping state property taxes at 1% of a home&apos;s assessed value.

Perhaps the most egregious example of the finger-pointing is a recent piece from TIME&apos;s Kevin O&apos;Leary, moaning that &quot;Before Prop 13, in the 1950s and &apos;60s, California was a liberal showcase.&quot; He insists that &quot;at the root of California&apos;s misery lies Proposition 13,&quot; and concludes that &quot;in California, the conservative legacy lives on.&quot;


How ridiculous. Of all the problems contributing to the fiscal mess, state under-taxation is the least of them. California&apos;s sales and gas taxes are the highest in the country - and it has the highest vehicle license fees and the second-highest top-bracket income tax, too. Its corporate tax rates are the highest of all Western states, and for the fourth year in a row, a survey of 543 CEO&apos;s found that California&apos;s toxic combination of high taxes and intrusive regulations made it the worst place in the nation to do business.

In fact, at the real root of California&apos;s fiscal misery is the profligacy of arrogant, big-spending, left-wing legislators, who have treated taxpayers as if they exist only to support the government. Their attitude was exemplified in a recent statement from state assemblywoman Noreen Evans (D-Santa Rosa), chairman of the state Budget Conference Committee, repudiating the governor&apos;s call for the state to &quot;live within its means&quot;:

Well, there is this mantra out there - &quot;live within our means&quot; - and while that sounds really nice . . . and it sounds really responsible, it&apos;s meaningless. Our means are completely within our control . . . We have just given away huge corporate subsidies in February; we have given away other tax reductions over many, many years; we&apos;ve created tax loopholes; in good times, we routinely give away taxes, and then in lean times we never replace those tax deductions or close those loopholes. . . . So &quot;live within our means&quot; doesn&apos;t mean anything. The fact is, we have a state with a population that have [sic] needs that we have a moral obligation to provide.

Her assertions - and the obnoxious sense of entitlement underlying them - defy credulity. For politicians like Evans (and the legislature is full of them!), when the hardworking or productive keep more of what they have earned, it&apos;s only because politicians have been &quot;giving away&quot; the tax revenues that purportedly belong to them. In this mindset, meeting the &quot;needs&quot; of a greedy, ever-expanding government is the only imperative; taxpayers are nothing more than cash cows, commanded to provide the fodder that allows Evans and those like her to meet their &quot;moral obligations&quot; with other people&apos;s money.

Remarkably, even as they have driven California into the fiscal ditch (and demanded ever-higher taxes from its citizens), Evans and her colleagues remain the most highly compensated state legislators in the nation. Along with their six-figure salaries, taxpayers supply them with cars, gasoline and auto maintenance. As regular Californians&apos; budgets are stretched to the limit, many of the &quot;cuts&quot; the state Senate is debating for itself are laughable. They include whether to reduce the benefit that provides their staffers with two new pairs of glasses yearly (or sunglasses, for those who don&apos;t wear glasses). The change would limit workers to one new pair - of course, courtesy of the taxpayers.

Ultimately, any honest assessment of California&apos;s plight must assign responsibility for the state&apos;s fiscal crisis - not to the taxpayers who voted for Prop. 13 three decades ago - but to the politicians who have subsequently exploited them without mercy. Indeed, if spending had simply reflected average population growth plus the average increase in the cost of living since 1991, there would now be a $15 billion surplus. After adjusting for inflation, the state now spends nearly 20% more per capita than it did 18 years ago; even as California&apos;s tax revenues increased by 167% during that period, state spending exploded by 189%.

Left-wing legislators like Noreen Evans can demand more taxes and journalists like Kevin O&apos;Leary can bemoan the existence of Prop. 13 all they like. The people know better. And when voters overwhelmingly rejected further tax increases last month, they sent a clear message: It&apos;s time for the politicians to start working for Californians again, rather than the other way around.

If they were demanding their politicians work for Californians (not the other way around), there would be recalls going on and lynchmobs tarring and feathering their overspending representatives in the streets.

IMO the message the voters sent was more like &quot;let the feds pay for our overspending&quot;... or in other words &quot;let some poor bastard who lived within his means live up to his moral obligation and pay for our next coke party&quot;

       Well, now, it&apos;s time to take another look at just how classy liberals are. In their latest move, they make fun of the &quot;retarded&quot;. Oh, but it&apos;s OK, because it&apos;s only conservative Sarah Palin&apos;s kid...

 You stay classy, Huffpo (updated) 

This is beyond Palin Derangement Syndrom. It is just plain nauseating.

Headline from post at Huffpo by Erik Sean Nelson:

Palin Will Run In &apos;12 On More Retardation Platform


Not surprisingly, it goes downhill from there:

In Sarah Palin&apos;s resignation announcement she complained about the treatment of her son Trig who always teaches her life lessons. She said that the &quot;world needs more Trigs, not fewer.&quot; That&apos;s a presidential campaign promise we can all get behind. She will be the first politician to actually try to increase the population of retarded people. To me, it&apos;s kinda like saying the world needs more cancer patients because they teach us such personal lessons.


The quote above comes to us via Pundit and Pundette because Nelson was forced to remove the offending article. Hot Air has a screen grab if you want to read the whole thing. Just make sure you haven&apos;t eaten for a couple of hours before you do.

Nelson gives a bizarre explanation for taking the post down:

“No one was seeing the absurdity of Palin hiding behind her children, so my piece was not accomplishing anything good.”


What a bunch of baloney. When did &quot;not accomplishing anything good&quot; EVER stop a lefty from publishing something as sickening as this piece? And maybe &quot;no one was seeing the absurdity&quot; because they were too shocked that any civilized human being would make fun at the expense of a Downs Syndrome child. All he had to do was apologize and let it go at that. Instead, he pretends that he&apos;s too smart for the rest of us - we just can&apos;t comprehend his nuanced sense of humor. So not only is he a rat, he is an arrogant prick as well.

Nelson is a liar - and a very bad one at that. He crossed way over the line and knows it and was surprised when many of his lefty friends joined conservatives in condemning this filth. This makes Nelson a coward as well who runs away at the first sign of criticism from his friends.

I sincerely hope Ariana Huffington does the right thing and banishes this jerk from ever posting on her site again.

Update: George Joyce adds:

Thanks to an avalanche of immediate criticism from our friends over at Free Republic the Huffington Post has removed Nelson&apos;s pathetic and disgusting attempt at political humor. While the Huffington Post bills Nelson as someone who writes for &quot;several comedy websites&quot; their decision to post his offensive essay should have tremendous negative repercussions in the coming days and weeks.

The coming storm soon to engulf the Huffington Post will also stir up memories of President Obama&apos;s casual insult to Special Olympians on the Tonight Show back in March. Compassionate leftists, in other words, are about to have their cover blown.

The Huffington Post has crossed a very dangerous line by posting the Nelson essay. With Obama&apos;s poll numbers dropping and his foreign and domestic policies facing mounting criticism the last thing Obama needs right now is to be identified with his adolescent supporters over at the Huffington Post.

A final thought: the continuing liberal assault on Sarah Palin and her family will backfire with American voters. It will also make Sarah Palin as tough as nails in 2012.

       Liberals: Learning Nothing and Forgetting Nothing 

A liberal acquaintance couldn&apos;t understand why conservatives are impatient with Obama. Didn&apos;t conservatives get enough of a chance with 30 years of Reagan and Bush, he asked?

OK, it&apos;s true that conservatives did get some tax-rate cuts. And we did win the cold war. And we did roll back one social program, welfare, a little, for a while.

But conservatives look on the Obama administration so far and say: Liberals are like the French Bourbons -- the royal house of France, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, deposed in the French Revolution.

After the defeat of Napoleon the Bourbon kings were restored in 1814. Talleyrand was disappointed. They have learned nothing, and they have forgotten nothing, he said.

The whole point of the Reagan era was to demonstrate that government should keep its cotton-picking hands off the economy. Governments and their mega-projects, their subsidies, &quot;backing winners,&quot; &quot;investments,&quot; always end in tears, just like they did in the stagflation of the late 1970s.

But it&apos;s pretty obvious that our Democratic friends have learned nothing from the lessons of the Reagan era, and have forgotten none of their old liberal delusions.

First we got a trillion dollar special-interest giveaway that was called a stimulus package. But unemployment keeps going up, now to 9.5 percent. Then the House of Representatives has passed a cap-and-trade energy bill that&apos;s another special-interest giveaway. Next up is a trillion dollar health reform bill that proposes to lower costs while increasing the number of people covered.

Yet Democrats are honest enough to be ashamed of what they are doing. Why else would they pass their trillion dollar stimulus bill without serious hearings or even a copy of the bill available to read. The same is clearly true of the cap-and-trade bill that passed the House of Representatives, sight unseen, on June 26. As Stephen Spruiell&amp;Kevin Williamson show on NRO Online, the Waxman-Markey bill is nothing more than subsidies, payoffs, corporate welfare and goodies for liberal activists. No wonder it had to be rushed through in the dead of night. It couldn&apos;t stand the light of day.

In the Waxman-Markey bill the grand principle of limiting carbon emissions through auctioned and marketable emission permits gets thrown under the bus in a crude special-interest feeding frenzy. What happened to saving the planet?

And buried in the bill are economic howlers that will freeze up the economy in the years ahead, write Spruill and Williamson:

Naturally, Big Labor gets its piece of the pie, too. Projects receiving grants and financing under Waxman-Markey provisions will be required to implement Davis-Bacon union-wage rules, making it hard for non-union firms to compete - and... Waxman-Markey forces union-wage rules all the way down to the plumbing-repair and light-bulb-changing level.

That will really help to revive the economy.

But President Obama&apos;s budget director had the best argument against the bill, according to a Wall Street Journal editorial:

In March, White House budget director Peter Orszag told Congress that &quot;If you didn&apos;t auction the permit, it would represent the largest corporate welfare program that has ever been enacted in the history of the United States.&quot;

The reason that the Democrats threw their grand cap-and-trade principle under the bus is that they didn&apos;t dare try an honest campaign to persuade the American people to back their Big Idea, that we should pay more for energy to prevent global warming.

When President Bush wanted to reform Social Security in 2005 he took his case to the American people. He failed to persuade them, and so he didn&apos;t get his reform. Democrats and President Obama don&apos;t have the guts for that sort of thing.

If only the Democrats were as queasy about the gigantic deficits they are forecasting. If only they were nervous about the rigidities they are introducing into the economy with their plans for forced-march government health care and green-energy subsidies.

It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to see that the combination of wasteful special-interest spending in the stimulus package, wasteful special-interest spending in the Waxman-Markey bill place a severe cost upon the US economy. Then there is the black hole of possibilities in any government takeover of the health care industry.

In Britain, a month ago, a Conservative Party spokesman admitted that public spending cuts would be needed. Prime Minister Brown thought that allowed him to make political points, one more time, on Labour &quot;investment&quot; versus Tory &quot;cuts.&quot; But then came the news that senior civil servants were drawing up contingency plans for 20 percent cuts in spending, starting after the election next year, in case the Chinese balk at buying British government bonds.

So far, the Obamanites have not realized that there might be a limit to borrowing, spending and subsidy.

That&apos;s because they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

       Extreme Makeover, Conservative Edition 

As you might know by now, I&apos;m in recent recovery from lifelong liberalism. Part of my program is confessing my sins. In my articles, I try to be as candid and honest as I can (which is great therapy, though, at times, I feel like I&apos;m on one of those reality shows where you folks are chilling with a cold beer and saying, &quot;Does she have any idea what a jerk she&apos;s been?&quot; and, &quot;Oh my God, does her face scream Botox or what?&quot;)

Well, you know, I deserve it. I was leftist for so many years, and I thought and said so many idiotic things that a little gentle ribbing is good for the soul (remember, the operative word is &quot;gentle&quot;). And I was a hypocrite. I preached forgiveness and kindness toward all, except conservatives. I prided myself on being a spiritually evolved being who refrained from stereotyping and discrimination. And yet I was engaged in prejudice against a whole group of people.

Well I&apos;ve renounced it all, and feel like the world&apos;s biggest ignoramus. A meatball, blockhead, sap, twit, peabrain, chowderhead, dipstick, dolt, and dumb cluck (I consulted my thesaurus for help here). But part of the reason why I was a class A fool was because I had been fooled. I saw all the Michael Moore movies and heard Michael Parenti speak, and bought books by Chomsky and Zinn, and listened to left of left KPFA radio, and did everything I was supposed to. My father raised me to despise conservatives, so there you go. I was brainwashed.

But if you think I&apos;m the rare bird, sorry Charley. Almost every liberal in the Blue States feels the same mindless malice toward the Right. (I imagine that in the Red States, liberals have to behave themselves because they&apos;re in the minority and, frankly, you people are armed.) Even my moderate Democratic friends from outside California regard conservatives with venom. Whipped up by rage at the Man and US Imperialism planted in the recesses of their brains by the far Left, liberals blame all wars, racism, recession, urban violence, poverty, even athlete&apos;s foot and hemorrhoids, on those satanic conservatives.

How well do you know your average liberal? To determine your LI (Liberal IQ), I have devised the following quiz. See if you can answer the following like a Blue State liberal.

1. The cause(s) of global warming is:

a. CO2 emissions.

b. Rush Limbaugh&apos;s hot air

c. George Bush.

d. All of the above.

2. The biggest threat facing the US today is:

a. North Korea

b. Iran

c. Home grown radical Islam.

d. Talk Radio.

3. We joined the Allies during WWII because of:

a. Hitler

b. Japanese Emperor Hirohito

c. Pearl Harbor

d. A Right Wing Conspiracy

4. Before I go to sleep at night I give thanks to:

a. Jesus.

b. The Hebrew God.

c. Allah.

d. Lama Obama.

5. These are a few of my favorite things:

a. Pledging to help Obama change the world.

b. Giving spare change to the victims of US hegemony.

c. Wishing bodily harm on George Bush and Sarah Palin.

d. All of the above.

If you selected D, congratulations! You have excellent LI. That&apos;s the good news; the bad news is that you are up to speed and know that there are countless people out there who despise conservatives.

Given the current climate, I didn&apos;t exactly pick the greatest time in the world to switch parties. I&apos;m living surrounded by leftists, and hear trash talk every single day. Liberals are amazingly creative at peppering their daily chitchat with attacks on conservatives (&quot;Hello, I&apos;d like a decaf mocha, and didn&apos;t George Bush destroy this country?&quot;) If I responded the way I&apos;d like to, I&apos;d lose my livelihood and risk my life.

Instead, to cope with the constant barrage, I&apos;ve perfected a beautific Mona Lisa smile: a half smile that reveals nothing. It&apos;s not an enthusiastic, perky full-smile nor is it a pejorative smirk or scowl. My Mona Lisa creates a momentary confusion in the other (&quot;What is that odd look on Robin&apos;s face -- is she agreeing, disagreeing, or does she have gas?&quot;) just long enough for me to hop right in and change the subject. For instance, when a colleague said to me, &quot;Obama is doing such great things to get us out of the recession which those disgusting Republicans got us into,&quot; my knee jerk reaction was to get in his face, but instead I bit off a little piece of tongue while doing my Mona Lisa personal best.

So, friends, we have a bit of a PR nightmare on our hands. In my opinion, conservatives need to mix things up a bit and get the word out that we are not the offspring of Lucifer. Perhaps a big tent, an end to infighting, and a sense of humor will help. Here is my small contribution to this political face lift, an Extreme Makeover, Conservative Edition: Robin&apos;s top ten list. Please post some of your own to keep the positive energy (as we say in Berkeley) going.

Robin&apos;s Top Ten List of Why Conservatism Rocks:

(Actually there are more than ten -- there were too many to limit it!)

US Navy Welcomes the USS Bill Clinton

Sunday, July 2, 2006 Vancouver , BC . Headed for Seattle, WA., the US Navy welcomed the latest member of its fleet today.

The USS William Jefferson Clinton (CVS1) set sail today from its home port of Vancouver , BC.

 

The ship is the first of its kind in the Navy and is a standing legacy to President Bill Clinton
&apos;for his foresight in military budget cuts&apos; and his conduct while president.

The ship is constructed nearly entirely from recycled aluminum and is completely solar powered with a top speed
of 5 knots.
It boasts an arsenal comprised of one (unarmed) F14 Tomcat or one (unarmed) F18 Hornet aircraft which, although
they cannot be launched or captured on the 100 foot flight deck, form a very menacing presence.

As a standing order there are no firearms allowed on board.

The 20 person crew is completely diversified, including members of all races, creeds, sex, and sexual orientation.

This crew, like the crew aboard the USS Jimmy Carter, is specially trained to avoid conflicts and appease any and
all enemies of the United States at all costs.!

An onboard Type One DNC Universal Translator can send out m es sages of apology in any language to anyone who
may find America offensive. The number of apologies are limitless and though some may seem hollow and disingenuous,
the Navy advises all apologies will sound very sincere.

The ship&apos;s purpose is not defined so much as a unit of national defense, but instead in times of conflict, the USS Clinton
has orders to seek refuge in Canada
The ship may be positioned near the Democratic National Party Headquarters for photo-ops. The Clin-toonsShould be very proud.

And the: USS Barack Obama---
Sailing in from Cuba

       Remember how the Democrats, including people here, whined and complained about Republicans allegedly blocking Democrats and not being bi-partisan? I guess it doesn&apos;t apply when they are in power...

 House Democrats muzzle GOP on sensitive issues 

WASHINGTON – In their zeal to protect their members from politically hazardous votes on issues such as gay marriage and gun control, Democrats running the House of Representatives are taking extraordinary steps to muzzle Republicans in this summer&apos;s debates on spending bills.
On Thursday, for example, Republicans had hoped to force debates on abortion, school vouchers and medical marijuana, as well as gay marriage and gun control, as part of House consideration of the federal government&apos;s contribution to the District of Columbia&apos;s city budget.

No way, Democrats said.

At issue are 12 bills totaling more than $1.2 trillion in annual appropriations bills for funding most government programs — usually low-profile legislation that typically dominates the work of the House in June and July. For decades, those bills have come to the floor under an open process that allows any member to try to amend them. Often those amendments are an effort to change government policy by adding or subtracting money for carrying it out.

The tradition has often meant laborious debates. But it has allowed lawmakers with little seniority to have their say on doling out the one-third of the federal budget passed by Congress each year. It was a right the Democrats zealously defended when they were the minority party from 1995 through 2006.
House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, D-Wis., insists the clampdown is to prevent debates from dragging on and on. Republicans, however, have agreed to limit the amount of time debating the bills.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., acknowledged in a brief interview that one reason for restricting amendments is to save members of his party from having to cast politically painful votes.

So instead of debating an attempt backed by House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio to allow more children living in Washington to receive school vouchers, the House will vote on a Quixotic attempt to eliminate the President&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers.

&quot;What they want to do is they want to avoid tough votes on appropriations bills,&quot; said Rep. David Dreier of California, senior Republican on the Rules Committee.
Even some Democrats are chaffing at the heavy-handed clampdown on debate. Abortion opponent Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., on Thursday lashed out at his party&apos;s leaders for denying him and others a chance to vote on restoring a long-standing directive by Congress blocking taxpayer-funded abortions in Washington, D.C.
Democrats effectively reversed that stance while the bill was still being considered by the Appropriations Committee. Stupak said the Democratic leadership&apos;s new policy on floor debates &quot;muzzles the voices of pro-life members.&quot;

The process has become so relentlessly efficient that Democrats were actually forced to drag out action to Thursday on a $33 billion measure funding energy programs and water projects. The reason? They need to stretch the workweek into Friday to force lawmakers to remain in Washington for committee work on health care and other spending bills.

Republicans complain that unless a member of their party is one of the 60 members of the Appropriations Committee, he is essentially blocked from having any say in shaping the budget.

&quot;That simply disenfranchises most of the members of this body,&quot; said Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.
Democrats say that months ago, they offered Republicans the chance for a more open process in return for a guarantee that Republicans wouldn&apos;t drag things out. Republicans initially said no but recently have agreed to limit how long a bill can be debated. Too late, say Democrats.
&quot;We offered Republicans the opportunity to work with us in a bipartisan way to offer amendments so we could complete the appropriations process in a timely manner,&quot; said Brendan Daly, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. &quot;They rejected that offer and have repeatedly used delaying tactics.&quot;

       Ah, yes. The oldest trick in the book, and one that liberals LOVE to use: misdirection. When THEIR plan isn&apos;t working, then shift attention to the Republicans...

 Recycling Old Lies 

With their trajectory heading further downward and the profligate spending they authorized putting not a dent in the weakening economy, the Democrats have reached into their bag of tricks and are recycling old lies.

The AP, among others, reports that House Intelligence Chairman Reyes has announced an investigation into a variety of post 9/11 intelligence opeartions undertaken by the Bush administration.

Included in this investigation apparently is a charge that Congress was not informed of a never utilized notion about killing Al Qaeda leaders who had taken refuge in countries not allied with us in the fight against terror, a plan not only never carried out but

(a) one which was reported on the front page of the New York Times seven years ago; and

(b) one which certainly if successful would avoid collateral damage to civilians now injured or killed when the very same thing is done by unmanned drones; and

(c) one which apparently--and contrary to Panetta&apos;s statement--never was ordered to be kept from Congressional notification by Vice President Cheney.

But that is all part and parcel of the Democrats&apos; unending efforts to tar and destroy those who did everything in their power to defend us.

In case you&apos;ve forgotten the sort of thing I&apos;m talking about here&apos;s a reminder of what they did to Alberto Gonzales.

The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, &quot;You&apos;re in a hot air balloon, approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2,346 feet above sea level. You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude.
&quot;She rolled her eyes and said, &quot;You must be a Republican.&quot;
&quot;I am,&quot; replied the man. &quot;How did you know?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everything you told me is technically correct. But I have no idea what to do with your information, and I&apos;m still lost. Frankly, you&apos;ve not been much help to me.&quot;
The man smiled and responded, &quot;You must be an Obama Democrat.&quot;
&quot;I am,&quot; replied the balloonist. &quot;How did you know?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;you don&apos;t know where you are or where you are going. You&apos;ve risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem.

       Robin, the former leftist, recognizes what I&apos;ve been saying for a long time...the pussification of America

 Are Men Obsolete? 

When I snapped out of my left wing trance last year, I was lost in space. I had no conservative friends and was clueless about web sites and books.

I had heard something vaguely about Talk Radio. So I scanned my AM dial and found Michael Savage. (It took several months, and a chat with a rather bemused new friend, before I even realized there were other hosts as well.)

Being a lifelong liberal, I&apos;d never heard anybody like Savage in my life. He yelled; he called people &quot;vermin.&quot; He was unbridled masculinity, not the touchy feeling kind I was used to. And he totally accepted himself: his moods, passion, temper.

But what shocked me the most was his saying that men have become &quot;feminized.&quot; I&apos;d never been so offended. &quot;Well, what&apos;s wrong with men being more feminine?&quot; I shouted back at my radio. &quot;Is there something wrong with femininity?&quot; Men being way more in touch with their yin and less with their yang sounded good to me.

I hadn&apos;t exactly been a big fan of masculinity. Like any good feminist, ranting and raving about men were two of my favorite pastimes. Men frightened me. Testosterone fueled types like Michael Savage scared the bejeezus out of me. I had good reasons, of course, given episodes of harassment and abuse.

I couldn&apos;t tune Savage out because he was the only game in town (or so I thought). Also, he was spot on about Obama, and his show was a rich tapestry of politics, philosophy, history, and religion. So I stayed glued.

What a difference a year makes. Now I see Savage as a seer warning us of the dangers we were in for if men went the way of the dinosaur. I had thought taming men&apos;s animal nature was a win-win for everybody. Now I realize it was tampering with Mother Nature.

And I have to wonder whether the feminization of men has been an unforeseen result of liberalism or some twisted scheme hatched by the left. In some ways, it feels paranoid to even go there, like I&apos;ve watched too many sci fi flicks. But at the same time if Professor Bill Ayers and his ilk could plot infiltrating the schools with all things Marxist, why stop there? Why not engineer a designer man who would go along with the liberal flow?

Step one: loosen men up through psychotherapy where they can get in touch with their inner child. Have them exchange their arms for drums that they can pound in the woods with groups of brothers. Teach them to reject logic and lead with their emotions.

Idolize gayness, because after all, aren&apos;t gay men just XY versions of the superior women? Degrade anything masculine. Marginalize and vilify the macho types like Savage, by banning him from the U.K.

Hike up the costs of SUV&apos;s and trucks, and squeeze men into deracinated cars like the Prius (notice how prissy even the name sounds?) Even better, herd them to work in buses and trains to save the planet (and control them).

Ask the question, as Maureen Dowd did in her bestselling book, &quot;Are Men Necessary?&quot; Answer in the negative by glorifying single mothers and supporting sperm donors. Why bother with a bossy husband when the government can put moms on the dole? And anyway, with gayness being the next big craze, there may be fewer straight men out there.

On the horizon: making the notion of gender arbitrary anyway. Allow people free and easy access to sex change operations (I&apos;ll bet good money they will be readily available under ObamaCare.)

Allow children to choose their own sex. (By the way, the fad is already in vogue and called &quot;gender neutrality.&quot; Parents don&apos;t inform their child of his or her or its gender and let the little mutant choose one.)

Even better, have your child be Bob one day and Becky the next, another hot trend called &quot;gender fluid.&quot; It&apos;s already happening at a few San Francisco Bay Area schools, where bathrooms are unisex and children get to alter their gender as the mood strikes them.

The piece de resistance of feminization: wreck the economy. If you want to cripple men, rob them of their life spring: their ability to provide for their family. No worries: the government will step in as a worthy substitute.

And the final stroke of genius: disempower the true symbols of masculinity: the military, police, and intelligence officers. Investigate them, sue them, protest them with riots in the street. Make them feel intimidated about doing their jobs. Require them to attend plenty of sensitivity workshops.

So, after decades of my going along like an automaton with the liberal program, I finally got it. As people like Savage have warned us about for years, tampering with gender is a disaster. And not just for men.

Because society shrinks when we are forced to give up who we are, and we become shells of ourselves when we&apos;re robbed of our birthright: dignity, freedom, individuality. We become cloned people, with this part and that part, never discovering who we are.

We become what the Tibetans call &quot;hungry ghosts:&quot; tormented beings looking all over for happiness but never finding it because we&apos;ve forgotten the only place it lives -- in our spirit, which is connected to forces Beyond. We lose forever the knowledge of our true nature that we first glimpsed when we were knee high.

Because the fact is that humans cannot, should not, fool with Mo Nature, shouldn&apos;t take nature in our hands and play God. To do so can unleash madness and danger as we know from every horror movie.

Because while we&apos;ve been engineering a kinder, gentler man, much of the world has been doing the opposite. Countries like Iran and North Korea have been building nuclear weapons and poisoning their young men with hatred of the U.S. They have been making their men stronger, meaner, and better armed.

Liberals: be honest with yourselves. In the end, if the worst case scenario happens (God forbid) and we are attacked, who will you run to? Will you scream out for the Green Czar?

No; all of us, liberals and leftists, conservatives and feminists, we will go where we have always gone from the beginning of time; we will search desperately for the big, strong men to protect us, the ones who have always had the guts, the courage, and yes the cojones, to put their lives and limbs on the line.

The question is: by then, how many will be left?

       From a link that Red88FF had in another thread, about another subject, comes a good lesson about how the liberal&apos;s favorite illusion, socialism, doesn&apos;t work, and hasn&apos;t for at least 400 years...

Excerpt from: The Real Story of Thanksgiving 

Now, the real story of Thanksgiving: &quot;On August 1, 1620, the Mayflower set sail. It carried a total of 102 passengers, including forty Pilgrims led by William Bradford. On the journey, Bradford set up an agreement, a contract, that established just and equal laws for all members of the new community, irrespective of their religious beliefs. Where did the revolutionary ideas expressed in the Mayflower Compact come from? From the Bible,&quot; and this is what&apos;s not taught. This is what&apos;s left out. &quot;The Pilgrims were a people completely steeped in the lessons of the Old and New Testaments. They looked to the ancient Israelites for their example. And, because of the biblical precedents set forth in Scripture, they never doubted that their experiment would work. But this was no pleasure cruise, friends. The journey to the New World was a long and arduous one. And when the Pilgrims landed in New England in November, they found, according to Bradford&apos;s detailed journal, a cold, barren, desolate wilderness. There were no friends to greet them, he wrote. There were no houses to shelter them. There were no inns where they could refresh themselves. And the sacrifice they had made for freedom was just beginning. During the first winter, half the Pilgrims -- including Bradford&apos;s own wife -- died of either starvation, sickness, or exposure.

&quot;When spring finally came, Indians taught the settlers how to plant corn, fish for cod and skin beavers for coats. Life improved for the Pilgrims, but they did not yet prosper! This is important to understand because this is where modern American history lessons often end. Thanksgiving is actually explained in some textbooks as a holiday for which the Pilgrims gave thanks to the Indians for saving their lives, rather than as a devout expression of gratitude grounded in the tradition of both the Old and New Testaments. Here is the part that has been omitted: The original contract the Pilgrims had entered into with their merchant-sponsors in London called for everything they produced to go into a common store, and each member of the community was entitled to one common share. All of the land they cleared and the houses they built belong to the community as well.&quot; They were collectivists! Now, &quot;Bradford, who had become the new governor of the colony, recognized that this form of collectivism was as costly and destructive to the Pilgrims as that first harsh winter, which had taken so many lives.

&quot;He decided to take bold action. Bradford assigned a plot of land to each family to work and manage, thus turning loose the power of the marketplace. ... Long before Karl Marx was even born, the Pilgrims had discovered and experimented with what could only be described as socialism. And what happened? It didn&apos;t work! Surprise, surprise, huh? What Bradford and his community found was that the most creative and industrious people had no incentive to work any harder than anyone else, unless they could utilize the power of personal motivation! But while most of the rest of the world has been experimenting with socialism for well over a hundred years -- trying to refine it, perfect it, and re-invent it -- the Pilgrims decided early on to scrap it permanently. What Bradford wrote about this social experiment should be in every schoolchild&apos;s history lesson,&quot; every kid gets. &quot;If it were, we might prevent much needless suffering in the future.&quot; Here&apos;s what he wrote: &quot;&apos;The experience that we had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years...that by taking away property, and bringing community into a common wealth, would make them happy and flourishing -- as if they were wiser than God,&apos; Bradford wrote.

&quot;&apos;For this community [so far as it was] was found to breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort. For young men that were most able and fit for labor and service did repine that they should spend their time and strength to work for other men&apos;s wives and children without any recompense...that was thought injustice.&apos;&quot; That was thought injustice. &quot;Do you hear what he was saying, ladies and gentlemen? The Pilgrims found that people could not be expected to do their best work without incentive. So what did Bradford&apos;s community try next? They unharnessed the power of good old free enterprise by invoking the undergirding capitalistic principle of private property. Every family was assigned its own plot of land to work and permitted to market its own crops and products. And what was the result?&quot; &apos;This had very good success,&apos; wrote Bradford, &quot;for it made all hands industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been.&quot; Bradford doesn&apos;t sound like much of a Clintonite, does he? Is it possible that supply-side economics could have existed before the 1980s? ... In no time, the Pilgrims found they had more food than they could eat themselves. ... So they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians.

&quot;The profits allowed them to pay off their debts to the merchants in London. And the success and prosperity of the Plymouth settlement attracted more Europeans and began what came to be known as the &apos;Great Puritan Migration.&apos;&quot; Now, aside from this program, have you heard this before? Is this &quot;being taught to children -- and if not, why not? I mean, is there a more important lesson one could derive from the Pilgrim experience than this?&quot; What if Bill and Hillary Clinton had been exposed to these lessons in school? Do you realize what we face in next year&apos;s election is the equivalent of people who want to set up these original collectivists communes that didn&apos;t work, with nobody having incentive to do anything except get on the government dole somehow because the people running the government want that kind of power. So the Pilgrims decided to thank God for all of their good fortune. And that&apos;s Thanksgiving. And read George Washington&apos;s first Thanksgiving address and count the number of times God is mentioned and how many times he&apos;s thanked. None of this is taught today. It should be. Have a happy Thanksgiving, folks. You deserve it. Do what you can to be happy, and especially do what you can to be thankful, because in this country you have more reasons than you&apos;ve ever stopped to consider.

       Message to conservatives - this is how the left see and feel about you. They honestly think they are better than you, above you, and that you need them to show you the way. They insult your religion, your life, your values...everything about you. Read this, understand it and never forget what we&apos;re up against.

 Hating Sarah Palin - and Us 

Any way you look at it, it&apos;s us vs. them.

The media elite hate Sarah Palin with a passion -- the same passion they have used for decades to rant about us. We are the &quot;primitive strain,&quot; the &quot;booboisie,&quot; or, as The New York Times put it, the &quot;Philistines.&quot; We are a people, according to Times columnist Maureen Dowd, that displays a &quot;reptilian American desire &quot; for prosperity and an innate disrespect for culture and our betters, who are the political and media elite that &quot;must nurse us through our affluenza.&quot;

Welcome to Mainstream Media World, where Sarah Palin is...us.

Call it Palin Envy, Palin Derangement Syndrome or even Palin Jealous. But the irrational hatred pouring from a thousand well-fed mouths, dripping from manicured fingers, from the talkers and squawkers of mainstream media, is fueled by the increasingly angry certainty that we -- and Gov. Sarah Palin -- simply don&apos;t know our place.

Witness rabid Palin-hater Kathleen Parker, the Washington Post and National Review columnist who has scored regular guest status on MSNBC for finding more than a hundred ways to say Palin is dumber than a chimpanzee... which, Parker opines, shows how much &quot;deadwood&quot; &quot;Miss Alaska&quot; has between her &quot;low-brow&quot; ears. After all, her &quot;oogedy-boogedy&quot; Christianity doesn&apos;t recognize the primacy of the primate in human affairs, putting her &quot;Clearly Out of Her League&quot; amongst cultured folks.

You don&apos;t need the brains of a chimpanzee to recognize the gulf between the world inhabited by Palin and that of Kathleen Parker, Peggy Noonan (Wall Street Journal, National Review), and David Brooks (The New York Times and National Public Radio) to name a few of the leading conservative lights of Mainstream Media World. To them, Sarah Palin represents the average U.S. citizen, who inhabits the American version of Bizarro World, the alternate Earth of Superman comics that was pledged to hate beauty and love ugliness; Bizarro inhabitants could achieve nothing without help from their betters.

Brooks says Palin is &quot;a fatal cancer,&quot; representative of average America. And Brooks knows average America, which he describes from his perch in Midtown Manhattan as having a &quot;trashy consumer culture&quot; filled with those who live in the &quot;vacuous realm of unreality.&quot; The denizens of Palin World -- us -- need to live a life of &quot;contemplation&quot; and be less &quot;materialistic,&quot; he scolds. He expressed his disdain for the Alaska governor, &quot;who scorn(s) ideas entirely,&quot; while dining at New York&apos;s Le Cirque restaurant (luncheon portion of spaghetti with tomato sauce, $28 -- no meatballs, too common; however, he was there for dinner and a larger portion, which begins at $98), which has &quot;wined and dined high society in New York for half a century&quot; and, praises the Times, makes its &quot;regular customers feel pampered and important.&quot;

Time magazine all but giggled when Palin was interviewed after her resignation &quot;while plucking salmon from the family fishing nets aboard a boat&quot; on the ocean. And the giggles came from both left and right: On Fox, Dana Perino, who served as President George W. Bush&apos;s press secretary and now works for an A-list beltway lobbying firm, expressed dismay that a serious political player would handle fish... other than the kind that is smoked, nestled on cream cheese over toast points, and dotted with capers. Real players take the time to stage interviews, she pronounced, her blonde locks swinging and giggle dripping with gravitas.

They don&apos;t get it: Sarah Palin is not a real player, just as we&apos;re not real players. Like us, she&apos;s a real person. And real persons don&apos;t do staged. We simply live life, doing what we can to &quot;pursue happiness&quot; and help others. Service counts: Gov. Palin, for example, had programs to help Eskimos struggling with winter food shortages.

That doesn&apos;t say food shortages are not a concern to Brooks, Parker, et al. Parker, who won journalism&apos;s prestigious H.L. Mencken Award for &quot;attacking (the) ignorance and stupidity&quot; of Palin America, recognized that Washington Post readers need to understand &quot;the concerns of everyday people&quot; in this economy. So she travelled to New York City (from her home in South Carolina, or her home in Washington, or her vacation place in Florida -- as Parker says, she lives an &quot;ordinary life&quot; among &quot;ordinary people&quot;) to observe the unemployed commiserating over lunch at Sarabeth&apos;s, where &quot;extraordinary cuisine and casual elegance&quot; cheer the Manhattan equivalent of Eskimos laid low by the economy.

Winter food shortages are in full swing on this snowy day in January in Manhattan. &quot;Pasta and champagne dinners&quot; are no longer the &quot;norm,&quot; Parker laments, as she sadly watches America&apos;s unfortunates do subsistence (choking down Cobb Salads, $26 a pop, or making do with hardly-a-mouthful Guacamole and Chips at Central Park South pricing of $13.50),while sitting in faux-Zebra covered chairs overlooking the park a few doors down from the storied Plaza Hotel.

But cheer up: Parker&apos;s niece, newly unemployed, points out that the women of the great north (above trendy Soho in lower Manhattan) are bearing up well, experiencing destitution with style, cheerfully concluding &quot;if you gotta be broke, you may as well be cool about it.&quot; And, of course, when the going gets tough (before you pawn that $1,500 Gucci you bought with your first paycheck), there&apos;s always mummy and Aunt Kathleen. Welcome to the economic downturn in Mainstream Media World.

Sarah Palin, who was ridiculed by one pundit for jewelry that looks like it &quot;had been picked up at a local craft fair,&quot; asks a simple question: when did &quot;pasta and champagne&quot; replace macaroni and cheese? And she challenges the central tenet, stated openly by Parker, that the average American wants those people who are better and smarter than them to take charge, to give them a country &quot;to be led by...elites.&quot; Otherwise, Parker warns, we&apos;ll get a woman whose &quot;lack of depth&quot; and &quot;lack of intellectual curiosity&quot; would have us doing things that prove, as Brooks writes, that we are, in fact, &quot;as shallow as we look.&quot;

But never fear: those whose superiority allows them to lead have some tips for those, like Palin, born to follow. Kathleen Parker offers advice: she&apos;d like to see Sarah do something literate, like take up journaling and use a few French words while referencing great literature, perhaps writing &quot;Madame Bovary, c&apos;est moi.&quot; French means intelligence to Parker, &quot;n&apos;est-ce pas?&quot; (translated &quot;isn&apos;t that so?&quot; to those who pluck salmon or believe in &quot;that great big problem: G-O-D&quot;). A reference to the classics, a bit of French, and a literary pastime might change for the better a woman who, as David Brooks says, shows no sign of contemplation, &quot;scorn(ing) ideas entirely.&quot;

In Mainstream Media World, thought and contemplation are highly valued. Brooks demonstrated this when sitting at dinner next to a Republican senator who, he said, &quot;had his hand on my inner thigh the whole time.&quot; What to do? Think. Breathe deeply. Contemplate. And so he thought and breathed and contemplated the hand on his thigh for more than an hour. Finally, dinner over, he came up with this reaction: &quot;I was like, ehh, get me out of here.&quot;

No doubt, it is different in Palin World, where we take our cue from the Bart (Simpson), rather than the Bard (Shakespeare). Simpson asked of a nearsighted friend who, like Brooks, wears eyeglasses, &quot;How can someone with glasses so thick be so stupid?&quot;

Faced with the same situation, for many of us there would be no contemplation. We would immediately take a fork -- there are usually three, sometimes four in the place settings at the ritzy restaurants inhabited by Mainstream Media World grandees -- and drive it into the senator&apos;s hand.

And then, giving Kathleen Parker the French she asks for and the senator the reaction he so richly deserves, declare &quot;Le thigh, c&apos;est moi.&quot;

       I never thought I&apos;d be a big fan of David Brooks, but now I&apos;ve developed a new-found admiration for him and his independence of thought. I thought he was just being paranoid about the ultra-conservative wackos in the Republican Party being out to get him. I was wrong; you&apos;re not being paranoid when it&apos;s true.

All of my conservative friends ... and there are many of them, including a retired fighter pilot who lives in Alaska ... are unanimous in their opinion that Sarah Palin has demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that she is unqualified for national office. We deserve better.

Wank on, guys!

And none of that excuses the way she&apos;s been treated. The left has show it has no morals, no restraint, no decorum...and so on.

I agree with you that discussions about Sarah Palin&apos;s jewelry and clothing are just as unfair and inappropriate as the distasteful discussions about Nancy Pelosi&apos;s neck, but there&apos;s a huge difference between &quot;She has been treated unfairly&quot; and &quot;Any way you look at it, it&apos;s us vs. them,&quot; particularly when &quot;them&quot; is your own party.

The bad treatment goes WAY beyond clothing and jewelry. They&apos;ve done everything possible to trash her, her family including underage daughters and infants, thrown every kind of ethics charge they could (and has beaten them all, and will probably beat the latest one) - the conduct of the liberals has been inexcusable.

What I post is relevant because liberals are in virtually total power, and are pursuing an agenda. The enemy is &quot;us&quot;, it&apos;s only &quot;some of us&quot;. I didn&apos;t vote for socialism, increasing taxes and fees and tripling the deficit. The liberals did. This thread is for looking into the philosophy and motives of the liberals. It isn&apos;t an abstract concept, it is a well-organized political ideology with an agenda, one that you are seeing played out as we speak.

       Here is an interesting piece on the President&apos;s science advisor...yes, Obama picked this whacko...

 Obama&apos;s Science Czar Considered Forced Abortions, Sterilization as Population Growth Solutions 

John Holdren, director of the White House&apos;s Office of Science and Technology Policy, considered compulsory abortions and other Draconian measures to shrink the human population in a 1977 science textbook.

 President Obama&apos;s &quot;science czar,&quot; John Holdren, once floated the idea of forced abortions, &quot;compulsory sterilization,&quot; and the creation of a &quot;Planetary Regime&quot; that would oversee human population levels and control all natural resources as a means of protecting the planet -- controversial ideas his critics say should have been brought up in his Senate confirmation hearings.

Holdren, who has degrees from MIT and Stanford and headed a science policy program at Harvard&apos;s Kennedy School of Government for the past 13 years, won the unanimous approval of the Senate as the president&apos;s chief science adviser.

He was confirmed with little fanfare on March 19 as director of the White House&apos;s Office of Science and Technology Policy, a 50-person directorate that advises the president on scientific affairs, focusing on energy independence and global warming.

But many of Holdren&apos;s radical ideas on population control were not brought up at his confirmation hearings; it appears that the senators who scrutinized him had no knowledge of the contents of a textbook he co-authored in 1977, &quot;Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment,&quot; a copy of which was obtained by FOXNews.com.

The 1,000-page course book, which was co-written with environmental activists Paul and Anne Ehrlich, discusses and in one passage seems to advocate totalitarian measures to curb population growth, which it says could cause an environmental catastrophe.

The three authors summarize their guiding principle in a single sentence: &quot;To provide a high quality of life for all, there must be fewer people.&quot;

As first reported by FrontPage Magazine, Holdren and his co-authors spend a portion of the book discussing possible government programs that could be used to lower birth rates.

 Those plans include forcing single women to abort their babies or put them up for adoption; implanting sterilizing capsules in people when they reach puberty; and spiking water reserves and staple foods with a chemical that would make people sterile.

To help achieve those goals, they formulate a &quot;world government scheme&quot; they call the Planetary Regime, which would administer the world&apos;s resources and human growth, and they discuss the development of an &quot;armed international organization, a global analogue of a police force&quot; to which nations would surrender part of their sovereignty. 

Holdren&apos;s office issued a statement to FOXNews.com denying that the ecologist has ever backed any of the measures discussed in his book, and suggested reading more recent works authored solely by Holdren for a view to his beliefs.

&quot;Dr. Holdren has stated flatly that he does not now support and has never supported compulsory abortions, compulsory sterilization, or other coercive approaches to limiting population growth,&quot; the statement said.

&quot;Straining to conclude otherwise from passages treating controversies of the day in a three-author, 30-year-old textbook is a mistake.&quot;

But the textbook itself appears to contradict that claim.

Holdren and the Ehrlichs offer ideas for &quot;coercive,&quot; &quot;involuntary fertility control,&quot; including &quot;a program of sterilizing women after their second or third child,&quot; which doctors would be expected to do right after a woman gives birth.

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; they write, &quot;such a program therefore is not practical for most less developed countries,&quot; where doctors are not often present when a woman is in labor.

 While Holdren and his co-authors don&apos;t openly endorse such measures on other topics, in this case they announce their disappointment -- &quot;unfortunately&quot; -- that women in the third world cannot be sterilized against their will, a procedure the International Criminal Court considers a crime against humanity. 

Click here to see the passage on sterilizing women | Click here for the full section on &quot;Involuntary Fertility Control&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s very problematic that he said these things,&quot; said Ben Lieberman, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation. Lieberman faulted Holdren for using government as a solution to every problem and advocating heavy-handed and invasive laws.

But other members of the scientific community said accusations against Holdren are wholly misplaced.

&quot;John Holdren has been one of the most well-respected and prominent scientific voices urging the federal government to address global warming,&quot; wrote Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a statement.

Holdren&apos;s co-authors, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, said in a statement that they were &quot;shocked at the serious mischaracterization of our views and those of John Holdren,&quot; caused by what they called misreadings of the book.

&quot;We were not then, never have been, and are not now &apos;advocates&apos; of the Draconian measures for population limitation described -- but not recommended&quot; in the book, they wrote.

Still, William Yeatman, an energy policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, faulted the Senate for not screening Holdren more strenuously during his hearings before confirming his nomination by unanimous consent both in committee and in the full Senate.

Despite &quot;the litany of apocalyptic warnings that turned out to be incorrect, no one was willing to stick his neck out&quot; and vote no, Yeatman said.

Some of Holdren&apos;s views on population came under fire during the otherwise quiet confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where Sen. David Vitter, R-La., asked him to revisit his past statements about environmental catastrophes that have never come to pass.

&quot;I was and continue to be very critical of Dr. Holdren&apos;s positions -- specifically his countless doomsday science publications and predictions that have been near universally wrong,&quot; Vitter told FOXNews.com.

&quot;I wish that the Commerce Committee had taken more time to evaluate his record during his nomination hearing, but like with everything else in this new Washington environment, the Democratic majority and the White House were pushing to speed his nomination along,&quot; Vitter said.

Vitter grilled Holdren during the hearing, asking him to clear up his 1986 prediction that global warming was going to kill about 1 billion people by 2020.

&quot;You would still say,&quot; Vitter asked, &quot;that 1 billion people lost by 2020 is still a possibility?&quot;

&quot;It is a possibility, and one we should work energetically to avoid,&quot; Holdren replied.

Sen. John Kerry, a leading Democrat on the committee, said the renewed scrutiny was essentially a Republican smear on Holdren&apos;s good record. Kerry told FOXNews.com that senators already had &quot;ample opportunity&quot; to question Holdren, who &quot;made clear that he does not and never has supported coercive approaches, end of story.

&quot;The Commerce Committee and the Senate then unanimously concluded what I have long known -- that John Holdren is a leading voice in the scientific community and we are fortunate to have him lead the fight to restore the foundation of science to government and policymaking that has been lacking for almost a decade.&quot;

Holdren has confronted a number of challenges during his four-decade scientific career, including nuclear arms reduction, and was part of a group that shared the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics,&quot; as the Nobel Committee said.

Now his greatest focus is global warming, which he said in a recent interview poses a threat akin to being &quot;in a car with bad brakes driving toward a cliff in the fog.&quot;

Holdren told the Associated Press in April that the U.S. will consider all options to veer away from that cliff, including an experimental scheme to shoot pollution particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun&apos;s rays and cool the earth, a last resort he hoped could be averted.

&quot;Dr. Holdren is working day and night for the Obama Administration and the American people, helping to develop science and technology policies to make the country stronger, more secure, and more energy independent, and to make Americans healthier and better educated,&quot; his office told FOXNews.com.

Four months after Holdren&apos;s confirmation, his critics are keeping a wary eye on his work in the White House, where they assert that he has the president&apos;s ear on scientific issues.

&quot;It is interesting that this 30-year-old book is finally coming to light,&quot; said Lieberman, of the Heritage Foundation.

&quot;The people who are concerned about Holdren, quite frankly we didn&apos;t do enough homework.&quot;

       Indulging craziness 

I&apos;ll bet this has happened to you. Some friend or relative is a little bit nuts -- maybe they just are, or maybe they have been burned by painful experiences. So they get very anxious about imaginary threats and outraged by imagined injustices. Maybe they&apos;re paranoid because they&apos;re smoking dope, or they drive drunk because they&apos;re young and stupid and think it&apos;s cool. Or maybe they&apos;re just jealous of people who look happier, or prettier, or have better toys. It&apos;s just ordinary human folly.

And to keep the peace, we indulge their craziness.

That&apos;s our biggest mistake. That&apos;s why we are in such trouble as a people and a culture.

We have been taught to indulge craziness. It&apos;s supposed to show that we&apos;re &quot;compassionate&quot;. Psychiatrists know this: If you let crazy folks set the rules, you have to get crazy right along with them. It doesn&apos;t matter if your client is crazy for good reasons. The cause doesn&apos;t matter one little bit. Good therapists are taught never to indulge craziness, because that just makes everything worse. Alcoholics Anonymous has long understood exactly the same thing. Real compassion doesn&apos;t mean joining people in the pits. That just means that you get two crazy people instead of just one. And then you get more and more, as the phony compassion spreads.

Our culture is now actively teaching racial paranoia to blacks, gender paranoia to women, and abuse paranoia to everybody with a beef. All those exaggerated fears and phony fits of rage have been cynically whipped up by the Left to grab more power. That&apos;s their Compassion Fascism. The rest of us go along, because we don&apos;t want to be bothered to stand up against it. But in the aggregate, over time, we have become a culture driven loopy by race, gender, and group paranoia. We have adopted the madness of the most race-obsessed people, and made them rich. Over time, they have worn down our sanity, so that our culture has literally gotten crazy.

Obama&apos;s first crazy-making person was probably his father substitute in Hawaii. By all accounts Frank Marshall was a race-obsessed black guy. It&apos;s not that he was wrong to feel angry, at the time. There were a ton of injustices against blacks. It&apos;s rather that he turned his pain into fanatical campaign of hatred, spreading it around to everybody else. That was Obama&apos;s first father figure in Hawaii.

Enter Henry Louis Gates, Al Sharpton, Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan, Attorney General Eric Holder and Barack Obama: All of them built fame and wealth on paranoid race politics. Enter Ruth Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Barbara Boxer (I&apos;m no lady, I&apos;m a Senator!), and an endless Conga Line of victim feminists. Look what those folks have done to Sarah Palin -- a high-tech lynch mob, driven mad with envy of Palin&apos;s good looks, popularity and joie de vivre. In the universities raging feminists, blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and Queer Studies nabobs -- among others -- have exploited the career specialty of victimology. It&apos;s a standard way to get tenure and promotion -- by slander, rumor-mongering and intimidation. We&apos;ve seen the faculty lynch mob at Duke U going after white lacrosse players. At Harvard, it&apos;s how the Left fired Larry Summers for daring to tell the truth.

Summers used to be a respectable economist, more or less, but now he is toeing the mendacious Obama line on the economy. Is it possible he was just burned at Harvard? Maybe Larry learned fear of the lynch mob at Harvard U, and Obama now has him under his thumb.

You see fear in the eyes of white guys around Obama. Brian Williams has his eyes cast down. Tim Geithner has this little head bow, looking at Obama with fear in his eyes while keeping his head bowed down. They look for all the world like Step ‘n Fetchit. That&apos;s all very amusing for purposes of racial revenge, but it means Obama is surrounded with lying commissars who fear to tell him the truth. Michelle is even scarier than hubby, and must be a terror in the White House. It was Michelle who got IG Walpin fired from her private playpen, Americorps. It&apos;s Michelle who is the child of the Chicago Machine, after all.

So this White House really does have Czars - Obama being Numero Uno -- and a Czarina -- Michelle, who supports the atmosphere of intimidation. If Obama seems badly out of touch with reality, the answer should be obvious: By spreading fear he guarantees that his commissars will lie to him. That&apos;s how the Roman Caesars drifted more and more out of touch as they gained more and more power. It&apos;s how Europe&apos;s monarchs managed to live in isolated splendor, totally in a glass bubble. It&apos;s how the Chinese and Japanese courts began to live out a Noh play.

Humans have a hard time facing reality. Power-hungry people drift into their own fantasy world by cutting off the truth-tellers. This is the most fantasy-driven administration in US history. That will be their downfall, as we are already beginning to see right in front of our eyes.

       Does sadism explain the behavior of some liberals?

 Sarah Palin vs. the Marquis de Sade 

I grew up with a mean older brother who was ten when I came on the scene. Family lore is that Tom ran away when my mother left to deliver me. When she returned he responded with disgust, &quot;At least you could have brought me home a brother.&quot;

Tom&apos;s main passion in life was tormenting me. He delighted in mocking me, scaring me, making me cry. He&apos;d laugh and make this strange, guttural sound when he saw my terror. As I got older, he enjoyed more menacing methods of torture, like holding me down and pretending to suffocate me.

It was easy to have access to me since my parents were usually galavanting around town with their pack of carousing adults, all of whom were in arrested development. When my folks were around, they&apos;d yell at him but he&apos;d just start up again when they were gone.

After I grew up and became a psychotherapist, I learned that there was a name for Tom&apos;s behavior, sadism. Sadists get a thrill out of being cruel and watching others suffer. While most abusive parents are motivated by a misguided effort to socialize and control, sadistic siblings just want to have fun by inflicting pain.

I rarely think of Tom, who disowned my family years ago. But when I reflect on what was done to Sarah Palin, I remember him and his sadism. And I look around and see more and more Tom&apos;s, all grown up; but they haven&apos;t grown up, actually; they refuse to grow up and use self control and restraint. And, alarmingly, many of them are in positions of power.

Let&apos;s call them by their true name. When an actress calls for gang raping Palin, she&apos;s a sadist. When people torch Palin&apos;s church with children inside, they are sadists. When bloggers call her a c___t and scorn her disabled son, they are being sadists.

Each day I wake up and the world looks more and more like my childhood: Tom&apos;s and Terry&apos;s who get a thrill out of terrorizing others; aging Peter Pans who won&apos;t grow up and enforce rules; parents too busy partying or saving the world to stay home, guide their kids, and teach them that all important word &quot;no.&quot;

Television shows that humiliate people by publicly rejecting and demeaning them; movies where audiences are kept pumped up on sex and violence; an Internet where you can post the vilest things anonymously, unfiltered.

A secular society where anything goes, where self fulfillment reigns, where morals and values are as disposable as yesterday&apos;s underwear, to be thrown in the trash when you&apos;re tired of them.

A society gone mad, a &quot;return to the primitive,&quot; as Ayn Rand described it forty years ago when she witnessed the growing power of the Left. Adults who have the impulse control of two year olds marching around, unhinged and uncontrolled, like Lord of the Flies. Teens beating up each other and teachers and uploading the video on YouTube.

Good people like Palin and Carrie Prejean being victimized in a manner so malicious that the intent is nothing short of destroying them. And the Powers that Be which could stop the growing brutality at any time by calling off the dogs, calling for order, won&apos;t do so because it serves their needs. After all, it&apos;s what Saul Alinsky preached: control the masses by keeping them agitated and paranoid.

Maybe what&apos;s happening today goes beyond Left and Right and speaks instead to the ancient struggle between good and evil. We live in a nation that has banished evil, that denies it even exists. But this is naive and foolhardy; good and evil exist hand in hand in the fiber of all human beings. We each have in us the seeds of Gandhi and the seeds of Pol Pot. It all depends on which ones we feed and nurture.

Evil, unacknowledged and unrecognized, takes root and becomes a virus so virulent, it threatens everyone whom it touches. Because evil changes people; it wipes out what makes them uniquely human; it turns them into something completely different, unrecognizable, alien.

And goodness is not just some old fashioned concept, some relic of days gone by. It&apos;s a privilege bestowed on us from the universe and we must cradle it and protect it as we would a newborn babe. We must never take it for granted, mock it or abandon it because it&apos;s the only thing that stands in the way of us and total anarchy.

Philosopher Jacob Needleman tells a story of walking on a bustling San Francisco street with a religious scholar from Tibet. Needleman asks his friend, &quot;If it is so rare to be born a human being, how come there are so many people in the world?&quot; His friend ponders the question silently for several seconds. Then he looks at Needleman and responds quietly, &quot;How many human beings do you see?&quot;

I look around each day and ask myself the same question, &quot;Where are the human beings?&quot; I see fewer and fewer each day. But there&apos;s a shining example in Alaska of a woman who maintained her integrity in the midst of cruelty that would have crushed many of us; who never descended to the level of the thugs; and who exits the scene with something that the sadists will never have, not even in their dreams -- her humanity.

       Maybe it&apos;s time we eliminate the left, before it&apos;s too late?

 The End Game of the Left 

Within the world of the far left, individuals have no value. Only the state matters. That is why the modern American statist devalues individual achievement and wealth. If, as in the socialist world of Marx, Engels, and Adolf Hitler (yes, Hitler, as I will explain later), God does not exist and humans have no souls, then the state determines the value of a human life. This philosophy leads to an ominous conclusion.

In my never-ending quest to understand the statist mind, I have attempted to use the principles of objective observation, or phenomenology, to analyze their intentions based on their behavior. Statists, it appears, have two proclivities: One, they are perpetually unhappy and dissatisfied with the current political and social environment, no matter what it happens to be. Two, they are viscerally angry at whoever stands in their way to the next level of progressive utopia. They do not tolerate alternate points of view. An objective individual might classify this behavior as classic immaturity. But there is much more darkness to the statist soul than mere boorish behavior.

The seemingly endless downward spiral into Dante&apos;s seventh level of socialist utopia was made into a movie back in 1968, aptly titled &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;. It was a pretty cheesy flick, but one particular scene left a lasting impression on me. This was where the radical leftist youths who took control of the government sent the old folks off to national concentration camps and forced them to drink from water coolers filled with Kool-Aid laced with LSD. For some reason, this image keeps popping into my head whenever I hear about ObamaCare. At the end of the movie, there is a foreshadowing that an even younger and more radical regime is about to overthrow the radical leftists in power. On and on it goes, with Dante&apos;s infernal utopia never quite achieved.

Concessions to the fantastic demands of statists lead to more dissatisfaction and anger, and increasingly fantastic demands. This is similar to the strategy of the radical Islamists living in Western countries. In fact, you can phenomenologically observe many attitude similarities between the statist and Islamist. Intolerance of divergent opinions, hatred toward &quot;non-believers&quot;, the obsession to dominate and control every aspect of others&apos; lives, and a dogmatic attitude guided by emotion rather than logic, are some examples. Of course, Islamists are just statists with a state religion. To the Islamist, the end game for the Infidel is conversion or death.

The statist philosophy, whether Islamic or otherwise, appears to condone and even embrace the concept of eliminating the members of the opposition by murdering them. While the left projects hatred, racism, and evil on the conservative end of the spectrum, it is they who actually exhibit these attributes. As New York University professor George Watson states in his book, &quot;The Lost Literature of Socialism&quot;:

But it was the issue of race, above all, that for half a century has prevented National Socialism (the Nazi party) from being seen as socialist. The assumption that socialism was never racist can now be seen as a misunderstanding.

The proletariat may have no fatherland, as Lenin said. But there were still, in Marx view, races that would have to be exterminated. That is a view he published in January-February 1849 in an article by Engels called &quot;The Hungarian Struggle&quot; in Marx journal the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, and the point was recalled by socialists down to the rise of Hitler. It is now becoming possible to believe that Auschwitz was socialist-inspired. The Marxist theory of history required and demanded genocide for reasons implicit in its claim that feudalism, which in advanced nations was already giving place to capitalism, must in turn be superseded by socialism. Entire races would be left behind after a workers&apos; revolution, feudal remnants in a socialist age; and since they could not advance two steps at a time, they would have to be killed. They were racial trash, as Engels called them, and fit only for the dung-heap of history.

Watson continues:

Socialism offered a blank check to violence, and its license to kill included genocide. In 1933, in a preface to On the Rocks, for example, Bernard Shaw publicly welcomed the exterminatory which, to his profound satisfaction, the Soviet Union had already adopted. Socialists could now take pride in a state that had at last found the courage to act, though some still felt that such action should be kept a secret. In 1932 Beatrice Webb remarked at a tea-party what &quot;very bad stage management&quot; it had been to allow a party of British visitors in the Ukraine to see cattle-trucks full of starving &quot;enemies of the state&quot; at a local station.

But after all, nothing like this could happen in America, right? Obama&apos;s building up of ACORN community organizers and the AmeriCorps civilian army with billions of dollars from the Stimulus couldn&apos;t be used against its own citizens, could it? His statement that &quot;We&apos;ve got to have a civilian national security force that&apos;s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded (as the military)&quot; doesn&apos;t scare you, does it? Read the following transcript from the testimony of Larry Grathwohl, an FBI informant who infiltrated a 1970 meeting conducted by Obama&apos;s close friend (and probable ghost-writer) William Ayers and included the leadership of the socialist Weather Underground.

I brought up the subject of what&apos;s going to happen after we take over the government. You know, we become responsible for administrating, you know, 250 million people. And there was no answer. No one had given any thought to economics. How are you going to clothe and feed these people? The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans, the North Vietnamese, the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States. They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution. And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education in the Southwest where we would take all of the people who needed to be re‑educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be. I asked, &quot;Well, what is going to happen to those people that we can&apos;t re‑educate, that are die-hard capitalists?&quot; And the reply was that they&apos;d have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further, they estimated that they&apos;d have to eliminate 25 million people in these re‑education centers. And when I say eliminate, I mean kill 25 million people. I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of whom have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious.

The end game of the left is the abortion and eugenic elimination of the &quot;undesirables&quot;, the euthanasia of the old and infirm, and the genocide of those who disagree. Its objective is the purity of socialist thought. And it is pure evil.

       OMG! Now I understand Neptune, and people like him!

 Liberalism and the Dumbing Down of America 

&quot;I&apos;d rather entrust the government of the United States to the first 400 people listed in the Boston telephone directory than to the faculty of Harvard University.&quot;
- William F. Buckley, Jr., Great American Thinker
As Barack Obama spends day after day touring the world (how many days has he spent in the Oval Office?), trashing America and taking the country on a trip to hell in a hand basket, the liberal electorate and fawning media for the most part remain completely enthralled by the One. Although his poll numbers have dropped considerably, liberals have yet to abandon ship as they remain strong supporters of the Dictator-in-Chief despite his anti-American agenda.

From socializing the country&apos;s infrastructure to gutting the Constitution, from cozying up to the world&apos;s tyrants to abandoning proven allies, many on the left simply cannot, or will not, open their eyes to the frightening direction in which Obama is taking our country. There are only so many times that one can use the phrase &quot;drinking the kool aid&quot; or &quot;brainwashed by his rhetoric.&quot; At some point, liberals must be held accountable for their willful ignorance.

I recently bumped into a Jewish neighbor who I had not seen in over a year. During the course of the conversation, she made a point of telling me that she was a proud Obama supporter. When I mentioned to her that I recently returned from Israel and was very concerned about the impact that his administration would have on that country&apos;s future, she asked me why. As I discussed the litany of concerns, she stared blankly at me. After a brief moment she stated, &quot;Well I think he will be great for our country.&quot;

This woman had no idea what I was talking about with regard to the administration&apos;s Mideast policies that have been at the forefront of every decision he has made to date. On what does she base her confidence in Obama&apos;s ability to lead America in these tumultuous times? Just for the fun of it I asked her how bowing to the Saudi king, shaking hands with Hugo Chavez, silently nodding throughout Ortega&apos;s hateful anti-American rant, apologizing to the Muslim world and abandoning missile defense would be helpful for the future of the country. Another blank stare turned into an insecure smirk and the conversation was clearly over.

This is but one example of the encounters that I have on a regular basis with friends, family, and colleagues who have no idea what is going on in the world. They read the New York Times and believe they are informed. There is no intellectual curiosity, no questioning of reporting, and no analysis of what the mainstream media is pouring out to the masses. While we all like to blame the fawning media which is complicit, if not actually abetting, in the usurping of the Constitution, I repeat: at some point we all have to take responsibility for our own thoughts and decisions.

As I watched events unfold in the streets of Iran after that country&apos;s rigged election, I was reminded of a conversation with a close liberal friend who voted for Obama but who could not intelligently discuss any major issue or explain why she voted for him other than the vapid (yet common) response that he will take the country in the right direction. Months into the presidency we had another conversation during which she wore her ignorance like a proud medal of honor, lecturing me that everyone is entitled to vote no matter how uninformed the person may be. And while she is sadly correct, that is surely not what the founding fathers intended.

Individuals were given the right to vote in order to ensure freedom. Millions of American lives have been lost fighting for that freedom both here and abroad. The right to cast a vote is a privilege, with that privilege comes responsibility. We have learned that too many Americans did not take that responsibility seriously in our last presidential election. The ignorance of the electorate is simply astounding, completely lacking in intellectual curiosity.

How many people flock to the magazine stands to buy the latest Vogue with Michelle Obama on the cover? What is it about her arms that have the average reader going gaga? She is not particularly attractive, when she opens her mouth she says nothing particularly insightful, and she is not very interesting. But magazines continue to feature Michelle and Barack Obama because evidently people cannot get enough of Michelle&apos;s latest $500 sneakers or $8000 purse and Barack&apos;s singularly unimpressive pectoral muscles and mom jeans.

Here in New York City, people believe that Obama is doing a bang up job. Perhaps some of them dislike America as much as Obama apparently does and they are not offended by his apology tours across the globe, his labeling of Americans as arrogant, or his socialist political agenda. But I surmise that despite the higher education so many liberals have been fortunate enough to receive, they lack the intellectual curiosity required for critical thinking and rational thought. And that applies to Obama and his entire administration as well.

If only someone would tell our newly elected Elitist in Chief that he is not chairing a think tank but is presiding over the free world and managing the greatest nation in the world. Unfortunately, our POTUS, graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, has surrounded himself with similarly educated professionals and advisors who fail to understand that they are not simply playing war games or posturing economic theories on a learn as they go basis.

The Obama administration is bursting with Ivy Leaguers who have been indoctrinated by, and who program others through, liberal education, yet who are clueless about the difference between idealism and reality. Alan Dershowitz is the perfect example as he opined in the Wall Street Journal on Obama&apos;s continued support for Israel despite the President&apos;s transparent animosity towards our ally (the only promised transparency we have seen to date from Obama!) As noted in my articles responding to his opinion, Dershowitz said nothing of substance, and yet liberals see his name on an article and it has instant credibility. Serious thought has disappeared under the Obama presidency.

I recently had dinner with a very intelligent acquaintance who had just learned of my conservative ideology. The conversation could have gone in any number of different directions addressing issues concerning Honduras, North Korea, health care or cap and trade. Instead, with an amused look on his face he said to me,

&quot;What I want to know is why Monica Crowley is so angry these days. Is it because McCain lost and she was hoping to be his press secretary?&quot;

Since the depth of the conversation was clearly not headed in the direction that I had anticipated, I responded to him with a similar type of question,

&quot;What I want to know is why liberals allow themselves to be informed by a media which has lost all credibility by its lack of questioning and analysis of the Obama presidency. Is it because journalism as a profession is dead or is it because half of the electorate have turned their brains to autopilot?&quot;

When I first began writing for American Thinker, I had a conversation with submissions editor, Larrey Anderson, in which I stated the maxim, &quot;Great minds think alike.&quot; Larrey corrected me and responded, &quot;Great minds think.&quot; Unfortunately for America, it appears that we have stopped producing great minds and are spitting out more and more individuals who enthusiastically allow the media, academia, and the government to think for them. Without great minds, this country has very little hope of remaining the greatest power in the world, and a beacon for those who aspire to achieve greatness

       The Obama Administration: Pursuing Zero Economic Growth? 

President Barack Obama talks about restoring economic growth. But his science adviser, John Holdren, once called for zero economic growth while writing with Paul and Anne Ehrlich--who predicted mass starvation in the 1970s.

Reports Cybercast News Service:
At a time when it was popular among environmentalists to talk about capping pollutants, John Holdren was writing about placing &quot;caps&quot; on the U.S. economy itself--and working toward &quot;zero economic growth.&quot;
Holdren, who is now President Obama&apos;s top adviser on science and technology policy, wrote in the 1970s that it would be &quot;entirely logical&quot; to cap the Gross National Product--the total productivity of the American economy.
&quot;It is by now abundantly clear that the GNP cannot grow forever. Why should it?&quot; Holdren asked in a 1977 college science textbook he co-wrote with Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich, titled &quot;Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment.&quot;
&quot;Why should we not strive for zero economic growth (ZEG) as well as zero population growth?&quot;

Admittedly, President Obama hasn&apos;t formally adopted this goal. But by putting the economy into hock and running up government borrowing, which even the Congressional Budget Office warns will crowd out private investment, the president seems determined to prevent a robust recovery. Maybe John Holdren will get his wish after all.

       How I became so conservative so fast 

I get asked by readers all the time: how can you go from left to right at such a rapid fire pace? Were you a conservative all along? Are you just yanking our chain; you&apos;re really still a liberal in conservative clothing?

Great question. This is a topic I ponder daily.

Now that I look back, I had the seeds of both a conservative and a liberal in me all along. On the liberal side: I was raised a secular Jew, and, for some God forsaken reason, most of us are Democrats. My upbringing lacked meaning and substance, which propelled my devotion to social causes. Of course, arriving in Berkeley in my 20&apos;s only hardened my liberal propensity.

I became a therapist, made friends with therapists, and spent tons of money having shrinks dissect my psyche. So my life was focused on problems, complaints, and kvetches. As Milton said, our minds can make a hell of heaven or a heaven of hell. My preoccupation with the darkness put me in a liberal state of mind.

But the conservative was alive and well in me too: My grandparents came from Russia with only the shirts on their backs. Yet they never complained about the hardships or expected any government help. My parents, in their own wacky way, were devoted, dutiful, and fiercely patriotic.

I was also victimized early on by do-gooder liberal politics (though I didn&apos;t put two and two together until last year). I attended public schools with forced busing that ignited tremendous animosity and racial violence. As an adult, I&apos;ve been harassed and molested innumerable times on urban streets both east coast and west, and was mugged several years ago in broad daylight.

Unlike most liberals, I never blamed myself or the dominant culture. I placed culpability directly on the thugs and on those in authority who remained silent. Whenever my friends excused immoral behavior, I would get seriously ticked off.

Lastly, my personality has always had elements both left and right. Now that I think about it, it&apos;s been dizzying living in my brain. I&apos;m a straight shooter and detest phoniness (conservative), though I wanted to be liked (liberal). I&apos;ve never been a group think person and don&apos;t like to be controlled (right), but at the same time, I wanted to fit in (left).

And it is impossible to hypnotize me. I took a hypnotherapy class once and the teacher put everyone in a trance, except for me. I asked the teacher about it afterwards. He said that there is a very small minority of people who cannot be hypnotized. (I now wonder whether most of them are conservatives!)

As I got into my 40&apos;s, my conservative, logical side started making more frequent appearances. I had some epiphanies: That, even with all my best efforts, the world was pretty much the same as when I entered it -- filled with both good and evil, dark and light. I had to admit, to my disappointment, that utopia wasn&apos;t around the corner, and that fate was in the hands of a Higher Power, not humans. I realized that life wasn&apos;t supposed to be easy, and that we shape our character through the hard stuff.

I viewed my parents differently, as struggling humans who did the best they could. I let go of my resentment toward them and literally threw out all my old journals that were filled with complaints. Feeling grateful, I wrote them each a letter of appreciation thanking them for the many gifts they bestowed on me.

But it was four years ago, when the bottom fell out of my life, that I transformed into a different person. First, my father died, the next day I was diagnosed with a life threatening blood condition, and three weeks later my mother died.

I recall sitting at my desk, so dazed and stunned that I could barely move. I heard this voice inside my head: Robin, you only have two choices: to hold on tighter to your illusions, or to let this experience shatter you and take you where you&apos;ve never gone before. I chose the latter, an experience that felt inspired by the Divine.

Suddenly, I grew up. I remember a session with a long term client after I returned from leave. She knew about my parents, and wondered aloud how she might feel when her parents died. She inquired, &quot;Even though I&apos;m a mom, I still feel like a little kid. Do you?&quot;

I answered instantly, &quot;Not any longer.&quot;

I woke up from a very long and deep sleep, like Robin Van Winkle. The traits of my arrested development, such as codependency, started melting away like snow in June. I started respecting myself more and requiring others do the same. I ditched friends who needed me as a teat or who treated me unkindly. I guess I was starting to embody conservatism without even knowing it.

My work with clients changed. I stopped reinforcing their stale, rigid stories. Rather than dredge up the past, we talked about how to live now, how to harness inner resources like courage, perseverance, and faith. I hoped to offer them the guidance and wisdom that I lacked in my younger years.

And then two years later, Obama came on the scene. He felt creepy; and I saw before my eyes that the sick, evil fringe of the far left had invaded the Democratic Party. As though I&apos;d been slapped across the face, I snapped out of my trance. The last vestiges of my liberalism flew the coop, and the rest, as they say, is history.

One more question this week:

Dear Robin:

Robin appearing on the Savage Nation? You show your true colors -- pure emotion and no substance like Michael Savage.

E

Hey E,

Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought that my name and Savage&apos;s would be included in the same sentence. It took me awhile to get used to Savage&apos;s style but now I appreciate his moxie. I&apos;ve grown tired of living in an air brushed, sanitized world. With Savage, what you see is what you get.

Plus, Savage would fit right in to my family. My kin didn&apos;t talk; they screamed. What might look to the casual observer like an episode of Family Feud, was actually a friendly chat. My parents would never say, &quot;Robin, I&apos;m concerned about what you&apos;re doing.&quot; They&apos;d bellow, &quot;What, are you crazy? You want to ruin your life and make your parents miserable?&quot; I never liked it as a kid. But as I got older, I realized that they always had my back, they had my best interests in mind, and they yelled at me because they cared. Sort of like Savage.

       The Left&apos;s Moral Absolutism 

In my high school World History class I remember reading about moral relativists who expressed moral indifference at the practice of forced female circumcision common in some African cultures. These moral relativists argued that moral principles were culture-specific and not universal. According to this theory, there is no objective standard by which to judge cultural norms.

Curiously, the moral relativists were equally reticent about immoral acts committed in the United States. They defended the violence of The Weathermen and other extremist groups, excused brutal murderers sentenced to death row, and extolled the virtues of the 60&apos;s counter-culture. The argument that morality is culture-specific was spurious, employed out of convenience, not principle. In principle, the moral-relativists refused to moralize across and within cultures.

The far left&apos;s tolerance (and in many cases open support) for the atrocities committed by communist regimes in the 20th century is well documented. The far left opposed the Truman Doctrine and Containment, arguing that America had no right to interfere in other countries. The fact that the Soviet Union was poised on global domination and had enslaved millions of people did not illicit moral outrage from committed American socialists.

It is true that many on the left became partially disaffected with the Soviet Union after Premier Khrushchev&apos;s speech condemning Stalin&apos;s atrocities was leaked to the Western press, and especially after the Soviet Union brutally suppressed Hungary&apos;s anti-communist uprising. However, aside from some stern rebukes, there was no real moral outrage and whatever tepid moral outraged did surface was always qualified by a moral-equivalence argument. That is, the Soviet Union&apos;s misconduct was no worse -- and perhaps more utilitarian -- than America&apos;s misconduct.

So what lies at the root of the far left&apos;s ethical code? What ideology compels them to excuse history&apos;s most tyrannical regimes, death row inmates, and homegrown anti-American militants? Is it moral relativism or is it something more insidious?

Moral relativism holds that all morality is subjective; nothing is fundamentally good or bad. Morality is in the eyes of the beholder and no one can claim the moral high ground. I don&apos;t doubt that there are purists who unwaveringly adhere to this nihilistic philosophy, but the far left does not belong to this orthodox breed. In fact, the far left shuns moral relativism with as much fervor as the &quot;moralizers&quot; the far left purports to despise.

The far left has no qualms about defending third-world barbarism, yet proclaims with an aura of ultimate righteousness that corporations are evil and that the men who lead them are corrupt tyrants, who profit at the expense of the public good. They routinely vilify Republicans, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, and all others who do not adhere to utopian Marxist ideals and variations thereof. To many of these so-called relativists Dick Cheney epitomizes evil; a man who served not only as the Secretary of Defense for the imperialistic United States but as Chief Executive of the multinational corporation Halliburton, itself a symbol of evil.

The far left&apos;s tirades against &quot;evil&quot; corporations and Christian (but almost never Muslim) zealots are not relativistic, neither in tone nor in substance. They are unambiguously absolutist. The left moralizes about perceived injustices -- be it the effects of capitalism or the war against global jihad -- with a religious-like conviction, never uttering the word &quot;relative&quot; in its condemnations.

After Saigon fell in 1975, the American left willfully ignored the enslavement, expatriation, and slaughter of millions of Vietnamese by the North Vietnamese Communists. Of course during the war itself, the left was quite brazen and outspoken in condemning America&apos;s involvement. The cries of &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;unjust&quot; in reference to the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies were ubiquitous.

The charge of moral relativism is simply not credible. If the left were truly morally relativistic, they would not deign to censure any policy, any doctrine, or any person. They would treat corporations and America&apos;s foreign policy with the same moral indifference as they treat murderers.

The common denominator of the people, doctrines and institutions that are despised by the far left has its origins in Western culture.

The aversion to Western culture and its core ideals, namely individualism, personal responsibility, and capitalism is the cornerstone of the far left&apos;s ethical code. The far left tolerates or condones only that which is the antithesis of Western culture: third-world barbarism, communist despotism, nihilism, and so forth. If Western ideals are the root of all evil, then its opposites must be good, or at least, not as bad.

The far left&apos;s support for domestic militarism is based on the premise that American institutions, especially constitutional republicanism and capitalism, are inherently corrupt and engender violent reactionary movements. Similarly, the barbaric acts of Communist despots are justifiable on the grounds that they represent a natural reaction to the oppressive capitalist system, as well as a means to a utopian end.

The aversion to Western institutions is in part rooted in Rousseau&apos;s famous, and almost always misunderstood, aphorism that &quot;man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains&quot;. Rousseau did not mean that men are &quot;in chains&quot; because they live under illiberal and undemocratic regimes, as most did during his time. Rousseau believed that men are in chains because modern norms, rules, and laws did not exist in man&apos;s natural state. Man was &quot;good&quot; and &quot;free&quot; in the pure state of nature, but over time was corrupted and imprisoned by artificial institutions. The absurdity of this nihilistic philosophy has been thoroughly dissected by many philosophers, and I will not repeat some of their counterarguments. What is relevant for the purpose of this essay is that Rousseau&apos;s nihilism is the primary building block of the far-left&apos;s ethical code.

The left maintains that Western institutions bear responsibility for all of society&apos;s evils. How often have we heard the claim that murderers are byproducts of their society, and therefore can not be held accountable for their actions? Personal responsibility is an illusion if we accept the premise that man&apos;s psyche is invariably corrupted and controlled by artificial institutions. Man is rendered helpless by unnatural norms and rules and therefore is incapable of being &quot;good&quot;.

The only logical solution to this institutional crisis is to destroy Western institutions and to restore the state of nature. Laws, social norms, and all other elements of modern human civilization must be vitiated, if we are to be truly free, happy, and good.

The far left would be hard pressed to praise Islamic terrorism, so they instead justify it on the grounds that it is the byproduct of Western oppression. The reigning godfather of the far-left, Noam Chomsky, sees the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as a symbol of the third-world&apos;s repudiation of Western imperialism. It makes little difference to Noam Chomsky that Imperial Japan was ruled by a ruthless dictatorship engaged in monstrous atrocities against other cultures, most notably the Chinese and the Koreans. What matters to Chomsky and the Chomskyites is that Japan in 1941 was the antithesis of Western culture. It shunned individualism in favor of collectivism, and practiced a religion that was at odds with Christianity. To Chomsky, a culture that rejects Western ideals is by definition noble.

The obsession with victimization and &quot;the oppressed&quot; is an important manifestation of the far-left&apos;s ethical code. You&apos;re either the oppressed or the oppressor. This simplistic derivative of Hegel&apos;s master-and-slave dynamic acts as an important theoretical underpinning.

Victimization enables the far left to incorporate multiple themes into its cultural and political framework. The Israelites, who are &quot;white&quot;, oppress the Palestinians who are Arab, and Muslim to boot. It doesn&apos;t matter to the leftists that a large part of the Arabic and Muslim world is in a perpetual state of sectarian violence. What matters is that the Palestinians practice a religion which has at certain times in history been at odds with Christianity. Again, the far left does not care that Christians stopped killing in the name of Christ many centuries ago, while to this day there are millions of Islamic extremists who believe in killing or enslaving Christians and Jews.

What is important from the far left perspective is that radical Islam represents the antithesis of modern Christianity. The maxim is simply that which is not an emblem of Western culture is by default good.

Therefore, from the far left&apos;s perspective, the core significance of the conflicts between the Palestinians and the Israelis, NATO and Al-Qaeda, is that they pit Christians against Muslims, Whites against &quot;people of color&quot;, the oppressors against the oppressed, and in the final analysis, Western ideals against non-Western ones.

Moral relativism is a doctrine too rigid and counter-intuitive for most people to apply consistently. Human nature compels us to be repulsed or angered by certain types of conduct, be it rape, theft, or the murder of the innocent. Our experiences and education further shape our moral compasses. It is then a question of which acts and institutions evoke moral outrage. Are we more offended by the nuking of two Japanese cities in order to end the bloodiest war in human history or by the slaughter of innocent men, women and children at the hands of despots who ostensibly seek to establish a paradise on earth?

Those who embrace Western ideals generally reject third-world barbarism as backwards and unjust. On the other hand, those on the far left who reject Western ideals condone acts and institutions which they see as a just reaction against Western oppression. What is clear is that neither the pro-Westerners nor the ant-Westerners are morally relativistic.

       More insight into the mind and attitude of the selfish, childish liberals. Heck, with this method, I&apos;ll be you could live in this country on just a couple hundred bucks a month!

 The Alinsky Way Vs. the American Way 

It takes neither a genius, nor a shrink, to see why Alinskyite Democrat pols are so confused by all this 1776 Redux confronting them in their home-district townhalls. Since they are so accustomed to calling up pals in unions and various other community agitators for a little rent-a-mob action to bolster support for their agendas, they naturally project this tactic onto anyone opposing their issue positions.

They&apos;ve become so immersed in the Alinsky Way that they&apos;ve nearly plum darned forgotten the American Way, folks.

They seem to be moving closer to tar and feathers by the minute, so I hope they remember American-style angst pdq.


Now, there is a most telling anecdote in Horwitt&apos;s biography of Alinsky, which perfectly demonstrates the fundamental difference between the Alinsky Way and the American Way.

Back in Chicago (really, is there something weird in Chicago water?), when Saul Alinsky, young-and-rising social engineer, was just beginning his attempts at community agitation, he seized an opportunity to try out his still-developing method. The Back of the Yards neighborhoods in Chicago, during the late 1930s, were filled with groups of ethnic immigrants. Most were Catholics from East European countries, and each country of origin even had its own separate parish church. This separation, naturally, made for some very stiff competition and the language barriers made for lots of fighting and feuding too.

The men formed softball leagues (truly American; they were catching on) as a way of safely expending excess energy and walloping each other without throwing real punches. The competition was fierce. Saul, professional meddler that he was, hung out in the ‘hood a lot and ingratiated himself with the locals, so that on this day, he had a ringside seat on the action. Two days before a long-anticipated championship softball game between two competing groups of immigrants, one of the star players came down on the rotted step of his apartment house and broke his ankle, which rendered him unable to play in the big game.

Saul merely ventured, as the disgruntled players were discussing their misfortune, that it need never have even happened. &quot;How so?&quot; the men asked. Saul proceeded to explain that there was now federal-government money for housing and that if they wrote letters to the right people, they would get some money to get carpenters to fix things. Of course, they then wrote the letters, got some money and thereafter knew how to shakedown the taxpayers to get their needs met.

Saul became an immensely popular guy in the immigrant ‘hoods, something he had never been in his own, and thereafter knew that his Alinsky Way had legs. From suggesting letter-writing, he moved on to his angry-mob approach to problem solving and became the invisible hand behind nearly every public temper tantrum thrown in these United States for the past 40 years.

Now, if the first thought you parried, dear reader, while reading this account, was why on earth some guy in the ‘hood didn&apos;t see the rotted step, get himself a hammer, some nails, a new step board, and fix the darned step himself before one of his own children was injured, then you are an American through and through.

Pat yourself on the back and sing Hallelujah at the top of your free-as-a-bird lungs.

The fundamental difference between the Alinsky Way and the American Way is so darned simple that even a first-grader, who has had decent parenting, understands it. The Alinsky Way involves asking others to do for you that which you are plainly capable of doing for yourself, but prefer not to do. The Alinsky Way is the purely childish method employed by tantrum-throwing tyrants of all ages, and has existed in one form or another since the beginning of time. It is egocentric, childish human nature carried into adulthood and all the way to the end of life, as long as others are too weak to just say, &quot;NO,&quot; or too beguiled to see through this silly, selfish ruse.

If you should ever happen to see an able-bodied grown man in a homeless shelter, supping at the table of charity, while snapping photos with a $500 techno-gadget, you have most likely spotted an Alinsky acolyte. If you should happen to see demonstrators carrying signs, obviously made in a professional sign shop, but the men holding the signs cannot read them, then you are most likely seeing Alinsky Way useful idiots.

The American Way, as we all know, is the do-it-yourself approach to life, which has been taught from toddlerhood to adulthood by every decent, upstanding American parent for more than 200 years. Every conscientious American citizen understands down to his gut that the most essential ingredient to serving the common good is to take care of his own self first and foremost. When a person takes care of himself, only then will he not become an unnecessary burden to his fellow citizens.

Those in the Democratic Party, who have adopted the Alinsky Way and thrown out the American Way, have done so with less than altruistic intentions. Keeping citizens as little children, incapable of doing for themselves, is the way to winning their votes and keeping them dependent upon the power of the state, which Democrats hope to control now and forever.

If one lacks a nation full of pitiful, can&apos;t-do-it-ourselves wee ones, there&apos;s no need for a Nanny-State, now is there?

And the only reason why Democrat pols are now so confused with all this loosely self-organized democracy in action at their townhall meetings, is that they honestly believe the American Way has already been defeated and we are all their children now.

These people really need to get out more.

There certainly are two Americas. Democrats control a portion of us through their Alinsky Way infantilizing tactics. But the vast majority of us still practice the American Way of do-it-yourself for the common good, which is the only reason this Country is still standing. If we all become children who produce nothing, there will be no pie for the Democrats to divvy up to the screaming kids they control.

       How to Influence a Liberal (But Not a Lunatic) 

By Robin of Berkeley

My Open Letter to Liberals sparked some concerns from readers that I had returned to the warm embrace of Mr. Rogers. Several kind souls even offered to spirit me away to safer pastures, sort of like a conservative witness protection program.

I can understand why it might have looked like I relapsed, perhaps by inhaling too much medical marijuana. But truly, there&apos;s a method to my madness.

I get it; evil exists, and it&apos;s running rampant all over the country and spreading like wildfire. The meanest, most sociopathic fringes of the far left have been set loose, like rabid beasts unleashed from a cage, and they&apos;re sinking their diseased fangs into conservatives. And there&apos;s more people foaming at the mouth every day.

But this is part of the Left&apos;s plan: Keep conservatives so agitated that we can&apos;t tell the nice liberals from the maniacs. There&apos;s a term for it in psychotherapy: hypervigilance, and it&apos;s associated with trauma. I don&apos;t know about you, but the constant cruelty, combined with the real threat of communism, is making me feel pretty traumatized these days.

But it&apos;s a particularly maniacal method that commies use: set their dogs on us so we feel persecuted (because -- hello? -- we are being persecuted). Then discredit, ridicule, and label us &quot;paranoid.&quot; It&apos;s sick, it&apos;s vicious, and it&apos;s all part of their game plan.

So I&apos;m not writing for the brain dead and the possessed. I deal with them sparingly and only for a darn good fee for a 50 minute hour.

But there have got to be others out there like me, with the potential to see the light. Yes, there are countless subhumans, but their mouths are bigger than their numbers. I was heartened that there were even two thoughtful liberals among the postings to my Open Letter. While I didn&apos;t necessarily agree with their views, I was pleased they were tuning in to AT, and that they were expressing themselves respectfully.

I&apos;m reaching out to those liberals who haven&apos;t lost their marbles yet. So I want to roll out the welcome mat to: Hillary supporters and other Democrats who chose Obama as their second choice; conservatives who punished Republicans but didn&apos;t bargain on Marxism; Ron Paul supporters who are looking for safe harbor; centrists who voted for Obama but are alarmed by the extreme left turn; and Obama supporters who liked him but now are having buyer&apos;s remorse.

As a therapist, I foster change. So I&apos;m trying out in the cyberworld what helps my clients. For instance, here are some techniques:

1. Tailoring my words to the audience. I used a phrase like trauma in my open letter because that&apos;s a word on liberals&apos; radar.

2. Engaging people: If I make them feel comfortable via empathy, they may stay awhile and start listening.

3. Zooming in on common bonds: I referred to experiences that unite all people, such as the search for happiness and our mortality.

4. Acting in unexpected ways: Liberals assume I&apos;ll be all snarky. If I&apos;m not like this, it&apos;s harder for them to dismiss me.

5. Externalizing the problem: This is a handy technique borrowed from narrative therapy. If people don&apos;t feel blamed, they&apos;re more likely to change. So in my piece, I cited big government as our common foe, rather than point fingers at Obama and the Democrats.

6. Cultivate doubt: Spot the vulnerability and plant seeds of uncertainty. As an example, I was speaking to a colleague who depends on health insurance for his private practice. I expressed skepticism that ObamaCare will keep paying for therapy. (The look on his face: priceless.) Creating doubt can be as simple as a mystified look or a well placed &quot;Really,&quot; as in, &quot;Oh, you still believe in Obama&apos;s stimulus plan. Really?&quot;

Another handy trick: instill doubt by making people feel separate, isolated. We are pack animals and most of us don&apos;t like to feel alone in a crowd.

So when an acquaintance made a nasty crack about Palin, I looked puzzled, then said, &quot;Oh, you don&apos;t like her? I do.&quot; When she recovered from shock, she sputtered, &quot;I don&apos;t know anyone who likes her.&quot; I answered, again appearing bewildered, as though I&apos;d never heard an anti-Sarah crack in all my life, &quot;Really? Everyone I know respects her. Did you know that she&apos;s one of the few successful women politicians who got there on her own?&quot; To her credit, she backed off and apologized (Yay! There&apos;s at least one liberal out there who is operating on all cylinders!)

6. Storytelling: This is a great technique culled from the master hypnotherapist, Milton Erikson. (There&apos;s much talk that the left has used hypnosis on us for decades, so it&apos;s time we get in on the game.) Erikson would subtly influence his clients through subliminal methods like storytelling. Rather than confront a client&apos;s defenses, he&apos;d meander in and out of their unconscious, like a graceful ballerina. For instance, with his son who suffered from a chronic illness, he&apos;d tell stories about a hardy tree outside his son&apos;s window, using the tree as a metaphor for overcoming great adversity.

So, here&apos;s how I used it with a friend who was waxing rhapsodic about Obama&apos;s stimulus bill. Rather than challenge her, which would have started a no-win argument, I listened, then we chatted about something else, and then I said the following:

I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about my parents; they died four years ago this month. I didn&apos;t appreciate them much as a kid, but now I really do. It blows me away how my grandparents arrived here from Tsarist Russia dirt poor to only face horrendous prejudice and poverty. But they literally kissed the ground when they got off the boat at Ellis Island. There was no government assistance back then. The Jews helped each other, just as all the immigrants did.

My grandparents raised their children in conditions that would be considered impoverished today but they never complained. My parents were also so grateful for the little they had, and they just loved this country. Sometimes I feel so ashamed of later generations. We have light years more than they ever did, and yet we always want more; we never say thanks. I wish my parents were around so I can tell how grateful I am to them and the sacrifices they made.

Then, as I observed my friend&apos;s utter incredulity and confusion, I changed the subject.

Think subtlety won&apos;t do the trick? The Left has managed to put half the country in a mass hypnotic trance using these strategies.

7. Last but not least: Allowing people to safe face. People will not change if they feel stupid or ashamed, even if the truth smacks them in the face. Robert McNamara elucidates this principle in the documentary, The Fog of War. According to him, the planet was saved because JFK permitted Khrushchev to remove missiles from Cuba on his own volition, thereby preserving Khrushchev&apos;s image.

For instance, if I say, &quot;What in the world made you vote for Obama? Didn&apos;t you see all the warning signs,&quot; the person will get defensive and dig in his or her heels. But if instead I remark, &quot;I think the media has been negligent in giving us the honest facts about Obama,&quot; or, &quot;I remember voting for so and so and being sorry about it afterwards,&quot; then you help them save face.

So these are some of my therapeutic trade secrets. Is it a pipe dream to think I can sway a wavering liberal? Perhaps.

But I keep reflecting on a story about Suzuki Roshi, a beloved Buddhist teacher in the 60&apos;s. He was giving a talk and declared, &quot;Life is impossible.&quot; A student raised his hand and asked, &quot;If life is impossible, how do we do it?&quot; Suzuki responded, &quot;You do it every day.&apos;&quot;

So I&apos;ll keep trying to make a difference even if it sometimes feels utterly futile and impossible. But that&apos;s what the hoodlums want us to believe, isn&apos;t it?

       Obama&apos;s Nazi Straw man: An Old Alinsky Trick 

When I saw this video interview of Bill Burton, White House Deputy Press Secretary, I could not help but be reminded of one of old Saul Alinsky&apos;s favorite fake-em-out tricks of the revolutionary trade. Burton is reinforcing Pelosi&apos;s earlier claim that people were carrying Swastikas at townhalls, but goes even further and claims that folks are actually &quot;dressing up like Hitler.&quot;

You got to give ole Saul a little credit. He was one wily deceiver, right after his hero, Deceiver in Spades, Lucifer.

Saul Alinsky, crusader for the downtrodden, darling of the Auxiliary Archbishop of Chicago, was just an underachieving nobody with neither guts nor moral code, who flummoxed a whole lot of willing-to-be-deceived power seekers. Saul Alinsky didn&apos;t invent a single new thing. His whole methodology, so widely-hailed by whole generations of leftists, could have been devised by any 12 year-old gang-style bully with half a brain and an ounce of charisma.

It&apos;s quite disheartening, now, to see the top echelons of the Democratic Party using Alinsky tactics in an attempt to freeze political dialogue, most especially when that dialogue is about the most intimate service we Americans procure for ourselves and our families: our medical care.

Nevertheless, they&apos;ve decided to go at this whole hog, even if it means stripping off their dignity and parading their political bloomers right out in the public square.

When Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and now the president&apos;s own deputy press secretary conjure up images of Nazis at healthcare townhalls, they are engaging in one of the oldest tricks in anyone&apos;s book, but an especial favorite of their mentor, Saul Alinsky.

Alinsky himself employed this method, quite deviously. Alinsky biographer, Sanford D. Horwitt provides an anecdote using precisely this same diabolical tactic to deceive the people. From Horwitt&apos;s Let Them Call Me Rebel:

&quot;...in the spring of 1972, at Tulane University...students asked Alinsky to help plan a protest of a scheduled speech by George H. W. Bush, then U.S. representative to the United Nations - a speech likely to include a defense of the Nixon administration&apos;s Vietnam War policies. The students told Alinsky they were thinking about picketing or disrupting Bush&apos;s address. That&apos;s the wrong approach, he rejoined, not very creative - and besides causing a disruption might get them thrown out of school. He told them, instead, to go to hear the speech dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan, and whenever Bush said something in defense of the Vietnam War, they should cheer and wave placards reading, ‘The KKK supports Bush.&apos; And that is what they did, with very successful, attention-getting results.&quot;

Planting major falsehoods has been a favorite Alinsky strategy from the start. His acolyte, Barack Obama, learned his Industrial Areas Foundation lessons on deceiving for power while on a side trip during his Harvard years, then taught the Alinsky power tactics at the University of Chicago.

Hardly qualifies as ‘Constitutional Law&apos; if you ask me.

Covering for oneself by accusing the other fellow has been the left&apos;s most successful deception for decades now. It took on its best traction lately, as leftists within Moveon.org and others have used this Nazi smear tactic for the past eight years against George W. Bush. They&apos;ve seen how well it&apos;s worked and just can&apos;t stop themselves now.

Here&apos;s a little hint from me on the Nazi card. If a few folks actually do start showing up at townhalls, opposing the MediCoup*, even dressed like Hitler and carrying a Swastika poster, I&apos;ll lay good hard cash on a bet that they&apos;ve been sent by this Alinskyite President or his minions to deceive, just as Saul did with getting students to dress like the KKK at that rally back in the 70s.

And any newsman worth an ounce of table salt ought to be able to pin the tail right on that Alinsky donkey.

*MediCoup is a term coined by writer, James Lewis, right here on American Thinker.

       A Fundamental Disconnect 

Hollywood and the media routinely offer up two standard portrayals of government officials -- inept and comical idiots or sinister characters. The latter is especially true of media depictions of NSA, CIA, and FBI employees, but both are quite typical of the reigning liberal elite&apos;s opinion of all government agencies and their employees: bureaucrats are either hilarious nincompoops or dangerous evil-doers, and amazingly enough, sometimes both at once. Hollywood seems to think that the government is either screwing up the country because it doesn&apos;t know what it is doing or it is destroying the country because it is trampling on the rights of its citizens.

However, the people who hold these convictions are the exact same people who want to turn over the operation of all the key components of the country to the government to manage. Health care, energy, education, the economy itself -- these and dozens of other critical features of American society should be directed, according to the Left, from the hallowed halls in which the bumblers and betrayers work.

These liberal elites, who are now in positions of great power in the nation, seem to believe that the politicians and bureaucrats who populate the federal government, are on the one hand part fumbling meatheads who can&apos;t tie their shoes and part evil plotters who want to screw John Q. Public. At the same time the left believes that those who run the bureaucracy should be entrusted with the management of virtually every aspect of American society. Is there not a fundamental disconnect here? What could possibly explain this self-contradictory faith in the power of the government to successfully solve the nation&apos;s problems? I will offer three explanations and then speculate as to which applies to the celebrity who now occupies the White House.

The first explanation is ignorance. The people of our nation have been subjected to an intense liberal indoctrination for so long that there are a huge number of them for whom the tenets of liberalism are so deeply ingrained that they accept without question the proposition that the government must address any problem that arises anywhere in America. Under a relentless assault from the liberal dominated media, educational establishment, legal profession, arts community, foundations, and even segments of the business and religious communities, many have succumbed to the brainwashing.

Consequently, they believe:


 FDR&apos;s New Deal saved us from the Depression rather than prolonged it;
 the Great Society helped to lift minorities out of poverty, rather than institutionalizing it;
 capitalism creates unjust, inequitable outcomes in the US, ignoring the fact that it has powered our economy to unimagined and unequaled heights of prosperity;
 government creates jobs by spending the tax payer&apos;s money, rather than preventing their creation because of the tax dollars pilfered from entrepreneurs;
 government regulations improve the functioning of our economy, revealing obliviousness to the enormous drag they impose;
 the rich don&apos;t pay their fair share, whereas in fact the &quot;rich&quot; pay the overwhelming majority of the income tax that Uncle Sam extracts, while the lowest 40% of income earners pay virtually nothing;
 the Constitution is a malleable document that serves as a guide to the making of law -- in fact, it is a binding document that can be changed only by a demanding Amendment process and the American republic has survived and prospered precisely because continuing generations have agreed to abide by the deal struck by our founders with the people;
 radical change not adherence to tradition, is the American way.


I venture that a large proportion, perhaps a substantial majority of the folks who voted for Obama fit into this category -- especially young people.

It is legitimate to ask how such hoodwinked people can accept the portrayal of the government as bumbling or sinister or both -- laugh at it if it is the former, be mortified by it if the latter -- and why does it not occur to them that it is lunacy to entrust their welfare to the bumblers and evil-doers?

I think the answer is to be found in the attitude teenagers exhibit toward their parents and teachers. The kids often see their elders as at best hopelessly square, out of it and even stupid and at worst as manipulating, tyrannical, and unfair. Most -- not all -- do not question the fundamental authority of their parents and teachers. The kids expect the adults to remove the obstacles that the youngsters encounter and the kids are willing to put up with the rules laid down by the adults because it is expected of them, because it is the natural order of things, and besides there is no choice. So too does the juvenile mass of brainwashed citizens view the authority of the federal government. They deride and lambaste it for its incompetence; they fear it for its omnipotence; but they accept unquestioningly its &quot;legitimate&quot; authority to control their lives.

The next explanation might be characterized as arrogance. Its practitioners understand that the government doesn&apos;t have a particularly good track record of solving the nation&apos;s problems. They recognize that previous government forays into health care, agriculture, housing, etc. have resulted in mismanagement, excessive waste, deleterious effects on the economy, fraud, and corruption. Nevertheless, they believe that the federal government is the correct mechanism to address the nation&apos;s problems and under their tutelage one (or both) of two things will happen. First, they will do it better. They will bring better design, planning, execution, and supervision. Or, it won&apos;t work any better, but they will profit personally from the results. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party is chock full, from top to bottom, with these types -- the naive ones who think they will execute the liberal agenda more perfectly and the corrupt ones who intend to profit from the agenda, however it is implemented.

The third explanation is malevolence. This characterization applies to the hard core leftists who believe the classic American political, economic and cultural systems are rotten and must be overthrown. I am thinking of revolutionaries like Saul Alinsky, George Soros, Michael Moore, and, yes, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright. They don&apos;t care that the government to which they wish to assign more and more responsibility is a combination of ineptness and corruption. So much the better; it will bring the system down more quickly. Radicals like these thrive on a crisis atmosphere (as admitted by Obama&apos;s chief of staff, Rahm Emmanuel). They seek to create a perpetual crisis, which leaves the people panic-stricken and easily manipulated by those who, under the guise of addressing the dangerous ills they have identified, will divert more power to the government, and who are in fact at work destroying the system under the false cover of crises like climate change and health care. If they can enact universal, federally-controlled health care and the business-crippling cap and trade bill, their malevolent objective might be attained -- America could be so fundamentally changed that there will be no hope of returning to republican principles.

I believe the vast majority of Americans on the left fit into category 1, a substantial number fall under 2 and a small, but dedicated cadre occupies the third position. Into which category does the guy in the White House fit?

Like most of America, my acquaintance with President Obama is recent and superficial. That he occupies the White House is a testament to the uncharacteristic recklessness of the American people, who have installed therein a person they know precious little about. Is he the leftist radical his voting record suggests or the relatively moderate politician he seemed to be during the campaign? Everyone who interacts with him insists he is very smart. If so, it is impossible that the rationale for his leftist mentality lies in the first explanation: ignorance.

Throughout the campaign, my impression was that he was a number 2: arrogant. Yes, there was no denying his far-left voting record -- but he tacked right during the election and then he appointed a number of relatively moderate cabinet officials (to go along with the hard core leftists he selected as advisors and czars, to be sure).

But since the inauguration, the gloves are off and the trend is clear. President Obama is a leader of the malevolent, revolutionary forces in America who want to overthrow the system and replace it with a Euro-socialist, nanny State that repudiates much of American history, including the Constitution.

What is the evidence? Many of his opponents would cite: his promotion of cap and trade, which surely would cripple our economy; his drive for universal, government-controlled health insurance, which would make virtually all of us wards of the State; his foreign policy of appeasement and repeated apologies for American behavior; or his reckless spending, borrowing and taxing that will bankrupt our children and grandchildren.

For me it is as simple as this. I see no evidence that he loves America, that he (or his wife) takes any pride in the achievements of our country, that he subscribes to the idea that America, unlike any other nation, is founded on a political idea and is called to be a beacon of freedom to mankind. That is not Barack Obama&apos;s America. His new America will be a bizarre combination of France, the Soviet Union and Canada.

       Obama, Ayers and the Knowledge &apos;Too Big&apos; To Handle 

In sifting through the intellectual landfill upon which the American left has built its worldview, a researcher can find any number of artifacts to help decrypt the Obama presidency.

Among the more illuminating is Weather Underground, a watchable 2002 documentary on the soi-disant Weathermen and their times. Although superficially objective, the film allows the final comment of Weatherman Mark Rudd to stand as something of a thesis statement.

&quot;It was this knowledge that we couldn&apos;t handle,&quot; says Rudd, explaining the group&apos;s turn to violence. &quot;It was too big. We didn&apos;t know what to do. In a way I still don&apos;t know what to do with the knowledge.&quot;

The Russian equivalent for Rudd&apos;s &quot;big&quot; knowledge is pravda, as in &quot;larger truth&quot; or &quot;truth and justice.&quot; In the Soviet era, Communists hammered the facts until they fit the &quot;truth.&quot; Small &quot;c&quot; communists like Rudd and his former colleague, Bill Ayers, still do. Their indifference to history stuns the knowing observer, especially in regard to the defining event of their era, the war in Vietnam.

By contorting every fact that did not naturally fit their template, the Weathermen and their allies concluded, in Ayers&apos; words, that America&apos;s &quot;intentions were evil and her justifications dissembling, her explanations dishonest, her every move false.&quot; This was the &quot;knowledge,&quot; uniquely intuited by the hard left, that Rudd and his colleagues found &quot;too big&quot; to handle.

In Weather Underground not one of the seven or eight Weathermen interviewed in 2002 questions this assumption about America and the Vietnam War. Neither do their liberal critics in the film, nor do the filmmakers for that matter. All that anyone questions are the futile ends to which the Weathermen applied their superior insights.

The film offers no hint that the 1968 Tet offensive proved disastrous to the Viet Cong. No hint that by August 1972, U.S. ground forces had so whipped the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) that they were able to withdraw fully from Vietnam. No hint that the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces (ARVN) held their own for nearly three years and collapsed only after a Democratic Congress cut off all military funding. No hint that Cambodia sunk into horrific genocide and Vietnam into a repressive Stalinist state after the Weathermen&apos;s communist heroes took over. No hint that the anti-war left ignored, or cheered, the horrific consequences of America&apos;s withdrawal. In sum, no hint that the Weathermen&apos;s larger truth was largely false.

More troubling, in neither of their memoirs -- Ayers&apos; 2001 Fugitive Days quoted above and Rudd&apos;s 2009 Underground -- does either author give any sense that his &quot;big&quot; knowledge is any less true or relevant today than it was forty years ago. America was and remains, in Rudd&apos;s words, &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;imperialist.&quot; It must be thus, as Ayers declaimed in a 2006 speech in Venezuela, because &quot;capitalism promotes racism and militarism -- turning people into consumers, not citizens.&quot;

Since hitting the mainland Obama has surrounded himself with leftists well versed in the knowledge too big to handle. &quot;I chose my friends carefully,&quot; he writes in his 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father, &quot;The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets.&quot; With his new friends, Obama discussed &quot;neocolonialism, Franz (sic) Fanon, Eurocentrism, and patriarchy&quot; and flaunted his alienation.

The literary influences Obama cites include radical anti-imperialists like Frantz Fanon and Malcolm X, communists like Langston Hughes and Richard Wright, and tyrant-loving fellow travelers like W.E.B. DuBois. &quot;Joseph Stalin was a great man,&quot; DuBois wrote upon Stalin&apos;s death in 1953. &quot;Few other men of the 20th century approach his stature.&quot;

In Dreams, Obama gives no suggestion that this reading was in any way problematic or a mere phase in his development. He moves on to no new school, embraces no new worldview. At least five of the authors he cites -- Wright, Fanon, Hughes, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin -- Bill Ayers cites in his writings as well. (As an aside, both Obama and Ayers misspell Fanon&apos;s name in the same way as &quot;Franz.&quot;)

For mentors, Obama chose men like Ayers, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the fraudulent Palestinian wannabe Edward Said, and the radical PLO groupie Rashid Khalidi. These are the men he turned to for wisdom. In 2003, for instance, Obama publicly thanked Khalidi for providing &quot;consistent reminders to me of my own blind spots and my own biases.&quot;

Khalidi, in turn, publicly thanked Ayers in the &quot;acknowledgments&quot; section of his 2004 book, Resurrecting Empire. &quot;Bill was particularly generous in letting me use his family&apos;s dining room table to do some writing for the project,&quot; he says of Ayers, a gifted writer and editor. In Rudd&apos;s &quot;acknowledgments&quot; section, he thanks his agent, Jane Dystel, who was Obama&apos;s agent as well. To complete this left wing cluster back scratch, Obama thanks Dystel, but, understandably, not Ayers.

Not surprisingly, given his inputs, Barack Obama has embraced a vaguely Marxist, post-colonial view of the capitalist enterprise. In the 2004 preface to Dreams, written after his keynote speech at the Democratic convention, he describes an ongoing &quot;struggle -- between worlds of plenty and worlds of want.&quot; America, he implies, prospers only at the expense of the rest of the world, a zero-sum fallacy common among those who refuse to understand the way free enterprise works.

&quot;I have seen, the desperation and disorder of the powerless: how it twists the lives of children on the streets of Jakarta or Nairobi in much the same way as it does the lives of children on Chicago&apos;s South Side,&quot; Obama continues. When the powerless strike back, the powerful respond with &quot;a steady, unthinking application of force, of longer prison sentences and more sophisticated military hardware.&quot;

By equating Chicago with the third world Obama endorses the link between racism and imperialism, the presumed motive for America&apos;s involvement in Vietnam. Later in the book, he makes this point more explicitly when he talks about righteous insurrections in &quot;Soweto or Detroit or the Mekong Delta.&quot; For the left, racism at home parallels imperialism abroad, one or both of which must inevitably underwrite the capitalist adventure.

To be fair, the &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Mekong Delta&quot; references -- the whole preface for that matter -- are more likely to have come from Bill Ayers&apos; pen than Obama&apos;s, but if so, Obama surely felt comfortable with Ayers&apos; conclusions. And from all evidence, even after eight months as president, he still seems to accept the left&apos;s relentless, anti-capitalist, anti-American agitprop as &quot;knowledge.&quot;

Whether it is &quot;too big&quot; for Obama to handle only time will tell.

THE SILVER SCREW


Once upon a time, a young lad was born without a
belly button. In its place was a silver screw. All the doctors told his
mother that there was nothing they could do.


Like it or not, he was stuck with it . . . He was screwed.

All the years of growing up were real tough on him,
as all who saw the screw made fun of him. He avoided leaving his house . And thus, never made any friends.

One day, a mysterious stranger saw his belly and
told him of a monk in Tibet who could get rid of the screw for him. He
was thrilled. The next day, he took all of his life&apos;s savings and
bought a ticket to Nepal


After several days of climbing up steep cliffs, he
came upon a giant monastery. The monk knew exactly why he had come. The
screwy guy was told to sleep in the highest tower of the monastery and the
following day when he awoke, the screw would have been removed. The man
immediately went to the room and fell asleep.

During the night while he slept, a purple fog floated in an open window. In the mist floated a solid silver screwdriver. In just moments, the screwdriver removed the screw and
disappeared out the window.


The next morning when the man awoke, he saw the
silver screw laying on the pillow next to him. Reaching down, he felt his
navel, and there was no screw there! Jubilant, he leaped out of bed . . .
And his butt fell off. The moral to this is:

&apos;Don&apos;t screw around with things you don&apos;t understand -- You could lose your ass.&apos;
Congress is noted for screwing around with things they don&apos;t understand - like the economy. That&apos;s why we are all losing our asses!

       The poor shmuck wanted to go to Tibet .
And wound up spending his lifes savings on a trip to Nepal instead.
He later sued the travel agent, won a million dollars, and lived happily ever after with a Burmese hooker.

Good story anyway.

       Wow...it only took EIGHT MONTHS for people to get tired of the Liberal Democrats crap...

 Charlie Cook: Dem prospects for 2010 tanking 

Charlie Cook is one of the most respected pollsters of either party in the country. He was predicting a Dem landslide in both 2006 and 2008 months before election day and was extremely accurate in estimating the final tallies.

He polls exclusively for Democrats which is why his analysis of the current political landscape is so shocking.

From Politico&apos;s The Scorecard:

 Charlie Cook, one of the best political handicappers in the business, sent out a special update to Cook Political Report subscribers Thursday that should send shivers down Democratic spines.

Reviewing recent polling and the 2010 election landscape, Cook can envision a scenario in which Democratic House losses could exceed 20 seats.

&quot;These data confirm anecdotal evidence, and our own view, that the situation this summer has slipped completely out of control for President Obama and Congressional Democrats. Today, The Cook Political Report&apos;s Congressional election model, based on individual races, is pointing toward a net Democratic loss of between six and 12 seats, but our sense, factoring in macro-political dynamics is that this is far too low,&quot; he wrote.

&quot;Many veteran Congressional election watchers, including Democratic ones, report an eerie sense of déjà vu, with a consensus forming that the chances of Democratic losses going higher than 20 seats is just as good as the chances of Democratic losses going lower than 20 seats.&quot;

Cook scrupulously avoided any mention that Democratic control of the House is in jeopardy but, noting a new Gallup poll showing Congress&apos; job disapproval at 70 percent among independents, concluded that the post-recess environment could feel considerably different than when Congress left in August. 

From what I&apos;ve read, the GOP is doing a good to excellent job of recruiting candidates to run in vulnerable Democratic districts. This is a turnaround from 2006 and 2008 when candidate recruitment by Democrats spelled the difference.

Could history be repeating itself and a landslide is in the offing for the GOP in 2010?

There are several factors working against that scenario but most professionals are now willing to entertain the possibility. That&apos;s a far cry from last January when talk of a permanent Democratic majority was all the rage.

And it took less than 8 months.

       Will America&apos;s bucking bronco finally be broken? 

You don&apos;t break a young bronco just by beating it. You break it by making it feel helpless -- confining it in a small corral, isolating it from the herd, running it around and around on a short rope, feeding it only when it follows commands, making friends with it, whipping it as needed, and making sure that it knows who&apos;s boss every second of the day. In the end the colt knows there&apos;s just no way out.

That&apos;s the real motivation behind &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; Obama is trying to sell us Euro-socialism, which means bribing and intimidating people with their own tax money and corralling everyone with an endless sea of laws and regulations, until they know they can never fight City Hall. The crux of ObamaCare is centralizing power; everybody is made helpless except the politically connected.

Eurosocialism is the power of the elites to break the will power of ordinary people by any means. You can kill with kindness, and if that doesn&apos;t work, with overwhelming control. It means controlling the supply of life-saving medical care, and punishing people for tiny infractions of Political Correctness, as defined by the power class. Ordinary people end up wading in a swamp of threats, rewards and propaganda that keeps them intimidated and cowed. Nobody wants to be accused of being a racist, a smoker, or a hater -- or whatever the target of the moment happens to be. Using media, indoctrination, taxes, doctors and cops, you corral people like a young bronco by making them helpless.

In Europe the Political Class is now impossible to throw out. Elections make no difference. The Ruling Classes are locked into permanent power just like Barney Frank and Nancy Pelosi. It&apos;s just the old European aristocracy under a new label. The permanent Ruling Class sends out an endless stream of commands, and the only appeal is to the bureaucracy itself. Franz Kafka had it right.

In European countries that used to stand for exemplary honesty and decency, corruption has now become pervasive, and it is never punished. In the UK, Gordon Brown&apos;s ruling Labour Party was just exposed for routinely double-billing the taxpayers for second houses and a hundred other little extras. The newspapers were filled with genuine outrage from ordinary people. With what result? Nothing happened. Nobody got fired or demoted. Gordon Brown just decided not to have general elections until things looked better for the Labour mafia.

That&apos;s not democracy. It is just another locked-in class system. That&apos;s how you break a bronco, and how you can break people as well.

What Marx called the Organs of Propaganda are the big stick of social control. The BBC is a great example. The Beeb has only one mission: To propagandize the little people on behalf of the Socialist Ruling Class. The Beeb will lie every minute of the day, stamp out the truth, and above all control everything people see and hear, day in and out. No human mind can resist the polluted river of propaganda. The Corporation has panel trucks going up and down every residential street in the UK, triangulating all the home TV antennas to see if they have paid their Broadcast License Fee. If not, they get hit with a hefty fine. Result: You can&apos;t have a radio or TV turned on without being spotted and paying the tax. It doesn&apos;t matter if you actually listen to the Beeb. (They are doing the same thing with internet connections even now. Look for it in your neighborhood.)

Just look at the decline of Britain&apos;s armed forces. In Europe the armies are welfare programs. The Socialists are ball-and-chaining soldiers. The need to buy votes for the National Health Service drains off all the money. That is why they still need America to defend them, sixty years after World War Two, and twenty years after the Cold War.

That&apos;s Obama&apos;s model. Obama is a hierarch: He lives for power, and feels natural only when he arrogates total control to himself. Socialized medicine is the key, because control over your health means the power over life and death. Once the Democrats control one-sixth of the US economy they can hang on to power for good.

We face a stark choice. The Left thinks it is winning. They want total control, but they will accept a foot in the door.

I hope we don&apos;t give them even a foot in the door, because our house will never be safe again.

       Marine Humor A U.S. Marine squad was marching north of
Fallujah when they came upon an Iraqi terrorist, badly injured and
unconscious.

On the opposite side of the road was an American Marine in a
similar but less serious state. The Marine was conscious and alert,
and as first aid was given to both men the squad leader asked the
injured Marine what had happened.

The Marine reported, &quot;I was heavily armed and moving north
along the highway, and coming south was a heavily armed insurgent.
We saw each other and both took cover in the ditches along the road.

I yelled to him that Saddam Hussein was a miserable, lowlife
scum bag who got what he deserved, and he yelled back that Ted
Kennedy is a fat, good-for-nothing, left wing liberal drunk who
doesn&apos;t know how to drive.

So I said that Osama Bin Laden dresses and acts like a mean-
spirited hooker!

He retaliated by yelling, &quot;Oh yeah? Well, so does Nancy Pelosi!&quot;

&quot;And, there we were, in the middle of the road, shaking hands,
when a truck hit us.&quot;

       In Obama We Trust? 

I grew up in a home where God was MIA. I don&apos;t remember religion being mentioned except occasional references to some sort of God and a heaven. While my family was proud of their ethnicity, they didn&apos;t practice the religion. Aside from the requisite Bar Mitvahs, they never set foot in a synagogue.

My parents did worship at the altar of pleasure. They loved to party; they lived for the times they&apos;d go out with their large, rowdy group, and dance and drink the night away.

I&apos;m not sure why my parents were such party animals. It was probably a way to escape the past, the memories of which were permanently etched on the mournful faces of my grandparents.

The past: Atrocities in Tsarist Russia. Poverty in the U.S. Tiny, noisy tenements in New York City; ghettos of immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe huddled together.

My father&apos;s dad, desperate for money during the Great Depression, accepted a dollar to name my father after another man&apos;s deceased loved one.

Brazen anti Semitism; recurrent chants of &quot;dirty Jew.&quot; WWII; the enormity of the death camps and the guilt of being safely sheltered.

My father, with a little money saved from working 12 hour days, reinvented himself. He changed his Yiddish sounding name to something WASP&apos;y, and moved the family to a look alike, tract house in the ‘burbs. While the lifestyle was modest compared to middle America today, my parents were euphoric, a state that continued even into old age.

Escapees from the ghetto, no longer targets, my parents finally felt like true Americans. They were happy as clams in their perfect, sanitized life of black and white TVs, a washer and dryer, frozen vegetables, and luxuries like bottled salad dressing.

When I think about my dad, I remember how he ate. Every morsel, whether formerly boxed or canned, was exquisitely delicious, and he savored each bite, murmuring &quot;Mmm, mmm,&quot; like a man just rescued from starvation.

My parents worked hard during the week, and then weekends traveled the cocktail party circuit, dancing the night away. They were in perpetual adolescence, recreating their lost childhood.

Meanwhile, I was a latchkey kid before the phrase was coined. With my only hobby being shopping, I occupied myself with my friends, the Addams Family, the Brady Bunch, Ed Sullivan, and Patty Duke. When I was a teen, it became mind numbing sex and drugs and rock and roll.

Weekends there was so little to do that I slept in until 1 pm. Occasionally I would tag along on a Sunday with my best friend and her family who went on outings. I was astonished that an entire family went out in the car for activities like picnics and museums.

It was a flat, colorless childhood with no strong arms to guide me. I drifted along the best I could, like a lone, unguarded leaf.

College was a blur of hook ups, hard drugs, and parties as I was speeding headfirst into disaster. Mercifully, in my early 20&apos;s, I found my way to a few decent boyfriends who had brains and I gained some myself, giving up my untamed habits along the way.

I settled down with my husband, Jon, a bookish type, who came from a family the polar opposite of mine. Jon still jokes (?) that he helped raise me.

Often Jon would drag me to talks by other brainiacs, where I would summarily nod off. But I like to think I absorbed something in between snoozes.

Eventually my life took shape: around my career as a psychotherapist and my leftist crusades to change the world. I found religion, or perhaps it found me.

I had just turned 30, an event that had given me the willies. Perusing a book by Buddhist teacher Chogyam Trungpa in a bookstore, I was entranced by the novel idea that happiness is not the goal of existence, but the byproduct of a life well lived; that the purpose of life was truth not pleasure.

I started studying Eastern religion with a fervor, especially books by Trungpa and Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh), and even called myself a Buddhist until I shed most of my old identities a few years ago. I became more of a heavyweight, able to look at the big ticket items of life -- mortality, illness, and suffering -- because I was safely nestled in the world of the Spirit.

I remember the moment I discovered God, in my 30&apos;s, when Jon and I were on vacation. I was reading a light novel, and he, of course, was studying some heavy tome. When I perused it and saw it was a religious book, I asked him, &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; (Yes I know it&apos;s bizarre that it took l0 years for the subject to come up.)

I was bowled over when Jon said, &quot;Yes.&quot; (He was also raised secular, and had never previously mentioned the G word.) My eyes welled up with tears. I realized that I did too.

I&apos;ve been thinking a lot lately about the factors in my life that lured me far Left for so long; what captivated me and held me there even with mounting evidence that the ideology was bankrupt. And why are millions still following the Pied Piper of Chicago, even though he&apos;s looking increasingly more corrupt and vacuous?

And I&apos;ve come to this: the Left is filled to the brim with people like me, who grew up in homes with God in permanent exile and various adults floating in and out in hot pursuit of self fulfillment. With no way to understand life, this realm starts looking like an unmanageable House of Horrors. The result: people turn to someone like Obama to engineer a whole new world.

So we have a situation today with the Left in charge, preaching their religion which is anti-religion. Their dogmas are so harsh that they make the Torah look like a light summer read. The Left&apos;s missionaries are trying to tame the savages (stupid white people) just as the missionaries of old traveled abroad to tame the savages.

But, as survivors of Jonestown learned, a religion without a beneficent God firmly in place, is a cult, and can destroy lives. Those spiritual teachers I admired when I was young, Osho and Trungpa? They turned out to be major pervs. They slept with their students, even encouraged violence against them. Both died as a result of their depravity.

Without some type of faith, people can remain in a state of ravenous hunger, as needy and frightened as a little lost child. They&apos;re looking for something, but all the roads are blocked off The only door leading to safety has been shut in their faces by a society that rejects the Sacred.

So the masses flock to Obama because he offers them meaning and a way to organize a chaotic universe. People believe he&apos;s some kind of Messiah because they&apos;re frantic for a Prophet to create a heaven on earth.

I saw a blog where a young person posts, &quot;I have pictures of Obama on my wall. He gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning.&quot; There are no rational arguments about bailouts and taxes that will counteract this desperation for purpose.

Our culture offers youth nothing of substance to carve out a dignified life. In the place of spiritual and intellectual richness, we pump them up with noxious television shows and films, texting and sexting, addiction to Facebook, and lots of drugs. We may have created a Generation N, for Nihilism.

And it&apos;s not just the young. Baby boomers are being dragged kicking and screaming into old age, without any spiritual guideposts and within a culture that fears and despises anything old. In ancient times, elders were revered as the cultural wellspring of wisdom and tradition.

But in most of the First World, older people are as disposable as yesterday&apos;s trash. How unacceptable to grow old in a culture that finds no grace, only disgrace, in wrinkles, and wants to hustle you out the door as soon as possible.

Baby boomers are also dancing to Obama&apos;s beat, enveloped in feelings of hope and change, holding on for dear life to their long lost youth. But it&apos;s not the real 60&apos;s with its hard drugs, violence, and exploitation of women, but a fantasy, frozen in time, of peace and flower power.

I understand the draw of Obama and liberalism and changing the world because I know what it is like when life has no other meaning. I understand how unbearable it is when not only one&apos;s parents but God is MIA and school is a forbidding place, and drugs only temporarily blunt the pain.

And I know the feeling of being so depressed that you grab onto anything -- whether it&apos;s a bottle or a relationship or a guru -- anything that eases the despair, and you won&apos;t let go, even when the consequences keep mounting. You won&apos;t let go until you find your way to the truth.

And I know what it&apos;s like to wake up from the fog, to shake off the dread, and to find that I&apos;m strong enough to walk on my own two feet and that a Higher Power lifts and carries me when I&apos;m too weak to stand.

If we as a culture don&apos;t find our way back to those young and old who are lost in space, adrift and unanchored, they will embrace false idols. For as long as Obama is the only game in town, the only way people can feel alive and hopeful, they&apos;ll ignore every red flag and defend Obama until their last dying breath. They must believe in him. The alternative is just too unbearable.

       OK, how&apos;s THIS for blatant hypocrisy? Remember all the anger from the left over the &quot;outing&quot; of Valerie Plame? What&apos;s their excuse for this? Is it suddenly different now that Democrats are in power?

 Sources: Photo of Key CIA Interrogator Shown to Gitmo Detainees 

The interrogator, a now-retired CIA operative named Deuce Martinez, had spent more than a year trying to get information out of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, known as the mastermind of those attacks, and Martinez also interrogated Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi bin Al Shibh.

As the Justice Department investigates whether Guantanamo Bay detainees were improperly given about 45 photos of CIA officers or contractors, FOX News has learned that one of the photos was of a lead interrogator of the accused plotters of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

The interrogator, a now-retired CIA operative named Deuce Martinez, had spent more than a year trying to get information out of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, known as the mastermind of those attacks, and Martinez also interrogated Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi bin Al Shibh.

Martinez&apos;s identity was first revealed publicly a year ago in an article by the New York Times, which published his name despite strong appeals by the CIA and its director not to run the story. The Times argued that Martinez wasn&apos;t a covert agent, but the CIA said revealing his name still would put his life at risk.

It is a violation of federal law to identify CIA covert personnel, and it is a violation of military commission rules to disclose classified information, even if only to the defendants.

The photos reportedly were provided to the detainees by the John Adams Project, a combined effort of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to assist in the defense of the detainees.

Sources told FOX News that the ACLU and detainees&apos; defense attorneys sent a photographer to Martinez&apos;s home in Northern Virginia and took photos of him that were later shown to some of Al Qaeda&apos;s worst of the worst at Gitmo.

But FOX News also learned from its sources that there is some question whether the Justice Department itself may have played a role in relaying photos of covert CIA operatives -- which would make the story even more unbelievable, according to some lawmakers with responsibility for intelligence oversight.

The Justice Department&apos;s investigation of the photos, led by counterespionage chief John Dion, is trying to determine if military lawyers defending the detainees divulged classified information or compromised covert CIA officers.

The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post on its Web site Thursday night. The ACLU told the Post the organization was confident no laws or regulations had been broken.

The lawyers defending terrorist suspects held at the Navy-run prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have sought to expose their clients&apos; treatment at the hands of government interrogators, particularly those held in CIA &quot;black sites&quot; overseas, where harsh interrogation tactics were used. Critics of those tactics say they are torture.

Such treatment is likely to play a central role in expected trials for the detainees, either in federal criminal courts or at military commissions, and defense lawyers are expected to try to call CIA personnel and CIA contractors to testify.

       Bi-Polar Liberals? 

I have to ask myself, are the Liberal/Progressive/Democrats, or LPDs, among us, aware of how crazy they sound? I&apos;m sure a lot of them are kind to children and puppies, and very few are hard-core crazy but they certainly sound like there is a serious wiring problem in their heads.

For example, they talk incessantly about &quot;choice&quot;, as in a woman&apos;s right to choose. Or &quot;choosing a life style&quot;, which is code for appeals to the gay and lesbian community. But even though the LPDs preach &quot;tolerance&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; in terms of certain other &quot;choices&quot; they are utterly intolerant. School choice comes to mind. As does any healthcare choice other than the so-called public option for health care insurance.

So, are they for or against the concept of individual choice?

The LPDs support sections of the health care proposal that would involve cutting off life lengthening care for seniors on the grounds that it is too expensive and would be a waste of money for someone who is no longer making a positive contribution to society. OK, maybe not exactly Sarah Palin&apos;s &quot;death panels&quot;, but close enough.

At the same time, though, these same über-liberals are completely inflexible in their opposition to the death penalty. It would seem to me that if anyone can be defined as not making any positive contribution to society it would be those who are on death row. But the LPDs insist that we house, feed, clothe and, incredibly, provide medical care for serial killers, rapists, and other types of non-contributing members of our society.

Likewise, why is the selection of a Supreme Court Associate Justice now predicated on the candidate&apos;s &quot;empathy&quot;. It&apos;s almost understandable that the judicial representatives of the people try to understand the point of view of those seeking justice before the bar, but it appears that it will be impossible to expect the same empathy for those whose only crime is being subject of the entropy that affects all living beings.

So, do LPDs favor or oppose the government determining if a person should live or die? And if they are for the government making such a determination, what do they propose as the ethical or moral basis for deciding the question? They&apos;re good at making an economic case, but they also keep hammering away at us on the basis that we have a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to respond quickly to resolve the problems caused by the crisis du jour. Or are we back to the question of &quot;choice&quot;? Are they telling us that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to &quot;choose&quot; for yourself what is best for you because they, the LPDs, are the only ones qualified by their educations at prestigious universities, and their incredible levels of empathy to make such determinations? Are they implying that non-LPDs just aren&apos;t smart enough to realize without government guidance that they shouldn&apos;t run with scissors.

And this apparent bi-polar disorder reveals itself in areas other than healthcare. Take the Global Warming (Oops, I mean Climate Change!) debate. LPDs announce that all CO2 emissions from ANY source are evil and are in fact, according to NY Times writer Paul Krugman, &quot;treason against the planet&quot;. So the LPDs have determined that we must destroy our economy, reduce our standard of living, and risk the lives of the elderly living on minimal incomes by raising the costs for them to heat their homes, to ensure that the CO2 genie is forced back into the bottle. OK, maybe &quot;ensure&quot; is too strong a word. Perhaps &quot;hope&quot; is more accurate.

Of course China and India have both said they won&apos;t even consider making the American and European LPDs happy by going along with this idea. In fact, the Chinese are planning to continue their massive expansion of coal fired electrical generating plants which will more than offset in CO2 emissions what the LPDs will &quot;cap&quot; with the Waxman-Markey climate bill.

At the same time that we are in the middle of this debate, the Obama administration has loaned Brazil two billion dollars to help fund the development of Brazil&apos;s huge offshore oil reserves. So the LPDs are adding to the source of CO2 gasses at a cost of a couple of billion, while demanding that we tax ourselves into poverty to reduce CO2 gas from the burning of petroleum.

Since the LPDs purposes are always noble and just chock-full of empathy and all that warm fuzzy stuff, perhaps they could explain how these two things are not in direct conflict with one another. And they could also explain why George Soros, the ultimate &quot;sugar-daddy&quot; of the LPDs, who is a major shareholder in the Brazilian corporation Petrobras that will be receiving the loan, apparently hasn&apos;t divested his holdings in protest of this despoiling of the planet. Maybe they could also explain why he&apos;s not a traitor to the planet.

Our good LPD friends also seem to have difficulty with the word &quot;big&quot;. It seems like it should be a fairly simple word to use, especially for those who have benefited from Ivy League educations. But they can&apos;t seem to differentiate between hating the word and loving the word. Just think about how it&apos;s used:

E V I L (and should be nationalized)

Big Oil

Big Business

Big Tobacco

Big Pharmaceuticals

Big Auto


G O O D (and should be bigger)

Big Government

Big Labor

Big Education

Big Media

And of course we have organizations like AIG which are &quot;too big to fail&quot;. But is that a good Big or an evil Big? Was the evil Bigness of General Motors offset by the good Bigness of the United Auto Workers?

This bi-polarism problem extends to the very basis of the entire country, our Constitution. When LPDs want to do something distasteful, they always resort to &quot;reinterpreting&quot; the Constitution, discovering penumbras, and making education a function of the federal government. This reinterpretation appears necessary, since there isn&apos;t a single word about education apparent to anyone who isn&apos;t an LPD. So the LPDs can see as Constitutional mandates things that are utterly hidden to ordinary folks like us. Right to privacy, rights to abortions, rights to unearned income, lots of rights. But rights that are clearly spelled out, in English any high school student could understand, like the 2nd Amendment, seem to be beyond them.

The LPDs also seem to think that if they are directing the effort, communities organizing themselves to accomplish social, economic or legislative and governmental goals are just wonderful. But if anyone not certified as an active LPD attempts to do the same, they are classed as evil. They are un-American. They are a distraction from serious debate. The only thing that the LPDs haven&apos;t called the folks at the tea-parties and town hall meetings is &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;.

Again, they seem to be unable to keep from oscillating wildly between multiple definitions of the same words.

The LPDs in Congress and the White House who claim to be able to direct the entire economy, the climate, and our very right to be alive should be able to express themselves more clearly. They should be able to think more clearly. But apparently they can&apos;t.

Perhaps WE should be making these decisions for THEM, since they appear to have some problems. It&apos;s a shame that those problems would preclude them from getting medical care, now isn&apos;t it?

       I checked out a link to this website for an organization called &quot;Fund for the Public Interest&quot; . I sent the following email to one of their people:

Your web site says:

 Fund For The Public Interest is a national nonprofit organization working to increase the visibility, membership and political power of the nation’s leading environmental and progressive groups. 

but then your website says...

 Current Fund partners like Sierra Club and Human Rights Campaign are expanding their donor base and passing tougher legislation against air pollution, forest clear-cutting, hate crimes, and special interest money in politics. 

Wouldn&apos;t YOUR organization be a special interest group, raising special interest money for a political agenda?

       Most happened on Obama&apos;s watch. It just took a little push from him to cause these to happen. He may or may not have caused them, but he didn&apos;t do anything to stop them from happeneing and even made some things worst.
The Republicans might have a majority the first couple of years of Bush&apos;s administration, the rest of the time it was the Democrats who held this power. It&apos;s even worse now, as there is no way to stop them from passing anything they really want to pass. Too much power is dangerous and this is what the Democrats are enjoying right now. 2010 can&apos;t get here fast enough.

the court even longer
and the white house and cabinet 1980 to 1992 and 2000 to 2006

       Camelot and Obamalot 

By Robin of Berkeley

I grew up in a storybook family. My parents, refugees from the urban jungle, felt like royalty in our little suburban home. They even referred to our lives as a fable, with a happily ever after ending.

The problem for me was the disconnect between what my parents said and what I experienced. As a kid my life felt more like a Greek tragedy than a fairy tale. While my parents partied hardy, I was bored out of my gourd at home.

When what you&apos;re told doesn&apos;t jive with your own eyes, you proceed in one of two directions. One way is to grow up and invent new myths for your life. You delude yourself into believing people love you when they don&apos;t. You&apos;re convinced that you&apos;re happy when you&apos;re not.

Or you can follow another trajectory, the one I&apos;ve traveled -- you develop a highly attuned BS detector. Your detector goes off loud and clear any time someone says one thing and does another.

When I was younger I&apos;d frequently ignore the blare of my BS alarm because I wanted so much to be loved and accepted. I hooked up with people whom I knew from the get go were bad news, and I suffered the inevitable consequences. I fell hook, line, and sinker for leftist ideology though the contradictions became more apparent year by year.

When I learned to stand on my own two feet, I started trusting my BS detector, and it&apos;s rarely failed me since. I can usually tell right away whether someone is a trustworthy person or full of crap.

I&apos;ve had friends admonish me for being judgmental and implore me to give people the benefit of the doubt. But it&apos;s not uncommon for that same friend to admit to me months later that I was right; the person was a Class A jerk.

Since Obama and the far Left are ruling our fair nation, my BS detector has been blasting like a siren. While conservatives prefer reality, the Left lives in fantasyland with its home base being the past.

In the liberal&apos;s eyes, life is all about atrocities, unfairness, every single awful thing that has happened since time began. It&apos;s a black and white world of good guys and bad guys, damsels in distress, and pseudo-heroes dispatched by the Democratic Party.

A favorite yarn of the Left is Camelot, the home of the Kennedy family -- John Sr. and Bobby, the saints who sacrificed their lives for this country; John Jr. who tragically died too young; and now Teddy.

While the Kennedy&apos;s did some good for this country, creating icons out of them is as foolish as a grown adult still believing in Santa Claus. For a tyke, the idea of Santa and elves and fairy godmothers offers refuge and comfort in an overwhelming world. When adults invent tall tales, all they&apos;re doing is fleeing from reality.

The talking heads now tell us we have a new Camelot, with Obama&apos;s smiling visage a reminder of the young JFK. Michelle, in her designer clothes, is presented as another Jackie, with pretty young children in tow.

When I ponder the Left&apos;s fascination with fairy tales like Camelot, my mind flashes on that great courtroom scene in the flick, A Few Good Men, when the grizzled Colonel Jessep (Jack Nicholson), bellows at pretty boy, Tom Cruise, &quot;You want answers? You can&apos;t handle the truth!&quot; And I think that progressives live in a hallucinatory world because the harsh realities of life stun them.

What is the truth? The Kennedys were not paragons of virtue. John F. Kennedy was a disreputable womanizer who escalated our presence in Vietnam, the war the Left most detests. Bobby assisted John with smuggling women in and out of the White House. John Jr. dismissed expert advice about inclement weather and flew his small plane anyway, with his pregnant wife and her sister on board, all perishing.

And Ted Kennedy paid some poor schlemiel to take a test for him at Harvard, and got them both kicked out (though Ted pulled some strings to get himself readmitted). He left Mary Jo to slowly asphyxiate in an air bubble while he fled the scene and constructed an alibi. Ted Kennedy may have even covertly supported the Soviets during the Cold War (isn&apos;t that treason?)

Michael Jackson, Ted Kennedy, all the Kennedys; the Left edits out the unflattering details about its heroes, leaving only a chimerical world, a Camelot on earth. But what is Camelot anyway? It&apos;s a made up place of dreams and wishes that come true if you only believe hard enough. It&apos;s the bedtime story we tell our children to lull them to sleep when they&apos;re afraid of the dark.

In Buddhism, there is a rich tradition of storytelling, but these poignant tales are designed to wake people up, not pacify them. One that touches me is about a Buddhist master whose main teaching is, &quot;Life is an illusion. It&apos;s all an illusion.&quot;

One day the master&apos;s son is tragically killed, and the teacher is incapacitated by grief. He sobs and wails in his room for weeks on end.

The disciples are unnerved by his being so ravaged by grief. One student volunteers to talk to him, and timidly approaches the master in his room.

&quot;Master, don&apos;t you remember what you always tell us? That everything is an illusion.&quot;

The teacher looks up, and in between sobs he cries out, &quot;Yes, I know. But the death of a child is the greatest of illusions.&quot;

It takes great courage for all of us, Zen masters and the like, to live in the world as it is, not as we want it to be. It challenges us to open our eyes and our hearts every day to both the miracles and tragedies of a human birth, what the Buddha himself called the &quot;ten thousand joys and the ten thousand sorrows.&quot;

Conservatives recognize that life cannot be easily pigeonholed into good and bad, fair and unfair because we don&apos;t know what adversity is doing to us.

What appears at the time as calamitous may have shaped our character and fortified our courage. The ancient Chinese understood this; in their language, the symbol for crisis means both danger and opportunity.

But liberals think that life should just be about the l0,000 joys. If there is sorrow, it means that something went terribly wrong, and someone should pay.

If I had to name the number one reason why the Left hates the Right, it would be this: because we shine the harsh light of reality on the Left&apos;s starry eyed hopes and dreams.

We expose their illusions for what they are -- naive, grandiose, even dangerous. As forcefully as Dorothy ripped open the drapery in the Land of Oz, we reveal that Obama and his ilk are not wizards, just little men and women behind a curtain.

Even when the Left tries to hide the sins of their heroes by canonizing them, we see through the charade. We know that effusive tributes and mile long processions do not exonerate immoral behavior.

For us, personal behavior matters. If a man abandons a woman to die, or sleeps with little boys, or calls his grandma a &quot;typical white woman,&quot; this speaks volumes about his character.

So the Left detests us because, to them, we&apos;re the spoil sports. We&apos;re the mean parents who break up the party and make all the children go to bed. We lecture them to mind their manners, respect their elders, and &quot;Who do you think you are to talk to me that way?&quot;

We expose their hair brained plots to change the world for what they really are -- castles made of sand that will vanish with the first strong wind.

We unveil everything they&apos;re hiding from, all the cold, cruel facts of life that render them helpless: that in the grand scheme of things, human beings are quite small; that none of us can or should play God; and that there are consequences for cruel or evil behavior.

And perhaps most of all, we trigger in their memory banks those excruciatingly vulnerable moments when the bubble burst, the truth broke through, and they were forced to look reality squarely in the face.

When they had to hear, &quot;Daddy&apos;s moving out&quot;; or &quot;Yes, this will hurt but only for a while&quot;; and, &quot;I&apos;m sorry but your kitty won&apos;t be coming home from the vet.&quot;

Or, what must feel utterly crushing to a youngster, &quot;No, there really isn&apos;t a Santa Claus.&quot;

       Obama and the Left 
The lesson of the rise and fall of Van Jones.

The abrupt resignation of White House aide Van Jones, deep in the news hiatus of Labor Day weekend, will probably be forgotten in a few days. But it&apos;s a story that still deserves elaboration for what it says about the political coalition that helped to elect President Obama and whose demands are leading him into a cul-de-sac.

As a candidate, Barack Obama was at pains to offer himself as a man of moderate policies, and especially of moderate temperament. He said he would listen to both the right and left, choosing the best of each depending on &quot;what works.&quot; He sold himself as a center-left pragmatist. When his radical associations—Reverend Jeremiah Wright, William Ayers—came to light, Candidate Obama promptly disavowed them. Now comes Mr. Jones, with a long trail of extreme comments and left-wing organizing, who nonetheless became the White House adviser for &quot;green jobs.&quot; This weekend he too was thrown under the bus.

However, Mr. Jones wasn&apos;t some unknown crazy who insinuated himself with the Obama crowd under false pretenses. He has been a leading young light of the left-wing political movement for many years. His 2008 book—&quot;The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems&quot;—includes a foreword from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and was praised across the liberal establishment.

Mr. Jones was a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, which was established, funded and celebrated as the new intellectual vanguard of the Democratic Party. The center&apos;s president is John Podesta, who was co-chair of Mr. Obama&apos;s transition team and thus played a major role in recommending appointees throughout the Administration. The ascent of Mr. Jones within the liberal intelligentsia shows how much the Democratic Party has moved left since its &quot;New Democrat&quot; triangulation of the Clinton years.

Mr. Jones&apos;s incendiary comments about Republicans and his now famous association with a statement blaming the U.S. for 9/11 had to have been known in some White House precincts. He was praised and sponsored by Valerie Jarrett, who is one of the two or three most powerful White House aides and is a long-time personal friend of the President.

Our guess is that Mr. Jones landed in the White House precisely because his job didn&apos;t require Senate confirmation, which would have subjected him to more scrutiny. This is also no doubt a reason that Mr. Obama has consolidated so much of his Administration&apos;s governing authority inside the White House under various &quot;czars.&quot; Mr. Jones was poised to play a prominent role in disbursing tens of billions of dollars of stimulus money. It was the ideal perch from which he could keep funding the left-wing networks from which he sprang, this time with taxpayer money.

This helps explain why the political left is so upset about Mr. Jones&apos;s resignation. Listen to David Sirota, another left-wing think-tank denizen and activist, who wrote the following Sunday on the Huffington Post Web site:

&quot;Finally, the Jones announcement will inevitably create a chilling effect on the aspirations of other movement progressives. Van is a fantastic person who has done fantastic work. He&apos;s kept his advocacy real and didn&apos;t compromise his principles. And so when he was appointed to a high-level White House job, it seemed to validate that you could, in fact, keep it real and also advance in American politics and government. That is to say, his story seemed to prove that an outsider could also succeed on the inside—and that outside advocacy doesn&apos;t automatically prohibit you from one day working on the inside.&quot;

Mr. Sirota is speaking for many on the movement left who believe they helped to elect Mr. Obama and therefore deserve seats at the inner table of power. They are increasingly frustrated because they are discovering that Mr. Obama will happily employ &quot;movement progressives,&quot; but only so long as their real views and motivations aren&apos;t widely known or understood. How bitter it must be to discover that the Fox News Channel&apos;s Glenn Beck, who drove the debate about Mr. Jones, counts for more at this White House than Mr. Sirota.

No President is responsible for all of the views of his appointees, but the rise and fall of Mr. Jones is one more warning that Mr. Obama can&apos;t succeed on his current course of governing from the left. He is running into political trouble not because his own message is unclear, or because his opposition is better organized. Mr. Obama is falling in the polls because last year he didn&apos;t tell the American people that the &quot;change&quot; they were asked to believe in included trillions of dollars in new spending, deferring to the most liberal Members of Congress, a government takeover of health care, and appointees with the views of Van Jones.

       Beck bags another one 

The man the left loves to hate scores again! Few people provoke as much derision among media swells as Glenn Beck, but that man knows how to expose misconduct and get results. Michael A. Fletcher reports in the Washington Post: 

The National Endowment for the Arts has reassigned former communications director Yosi Sergant, who had become the latest target of FOX News talk show host Glenn Beck.

Acting NEA communications director Victoria Hutter said Thursday that Sergant had left the communications post. The move came after he had come under attack from Beck, a conservative commentator who accused Sergant of attempting to use taxpayer money to fund art to support the president&apos;s initiatives.

Sergant&apos;s reassignment came after the resignation last weekend of environmental adviser Van Jones, who had been criticized for weeks by Beck.

In an alternate universe where the mainstream media were not left wing ideologues, Beck would be garnering Peabody awards and maybe even a Pulitzer Prize for uncovering misconduct in high places. But the media and academic establishments are far too corrupt and committed to propagandistic support of Obama for that to happen.

Meanwhile, newspaper and magazine circulations continue to decline, and broadcast network news ratings are in the toilet. MSNBC and CNN attract fewer viewers than last year. All the while, Beck&apos;s listenership and viewership soar, despite the attempt by an organization Van Jones founded fulminating at advertisers in order to encourage an advertiser boycott.

Thanks for hanging tough and exposing the creeps, Glenn!

       NY Times admits it was &apos;a beat behind&apos; Van Jones story 

Rick Moran
What to do if you&apos;re the &quot;newspaper of record&quot; and fail to record the facts of a big story - even after it&apos;s over?

Lie, lie, lie - then lie some more reports Kyle Smith of the New York Post:

&quot;Our Washington bureau was somewhat short-staffed during the height of the pre-Labor Day vacation period.&quot;

What&apos;s next? &quot;My dog ate the copy?&quot;

Jill Abramson, the managing editor, admitted only to being &quot;a beat behind&quot; the story but added that the paper had caught up - after the saga was over. The EMS equivalent of this statement would be, &quot;Sorry I didn&apos;t take your 911 call for four days. At least I was in time for the funeral.&quot;

Although Abramson&apos;s excuse was not an excuse, she proceeded to offer another one: &quot;Mr. Jones was not a high-ranking official.&quot;

Oh. And here I was, thinking that he was &quot;one of Mr. Obama&apos;s top advisers,&quot; as I was told by, well, The Times, on its Caucus blog on Sept. 5. Confusing, confusing.

Only in Timesland can you be in charge of doling out $80 billion in contracts (&quot;A Small White House Program&quot; - The Times&apos; John M. Broder, on Sept. 6) and be less important than the Naked Cowboy.

The Times was aware of the story, knew it was bigger than most of the stuff it puts in the paper every day, and had plenty of resources to cover it.

But The Times purposely ignored it because it was hoping that the story would go away, because it likes people like Comrade Jones and was hoping he wouldn&apos;t be forced out. The Times doesn&apos;t like people like Glenn Beck and didn&apos;t want him to be able to claim Jones&apos;s scalp. The Times&apos; prejudice blinded it to the fact that Jones&apos; fall became obvious on Friday, when a White House spokesman refused to defend him.

Smith adds, &quot;The Times has still not told its readers that Jones is or was a communist, calling this notion merely a charge made only by Republicans - we all know how nutty they are! - not as a fact.&quot; In the world of the New York Times, when someone actually admits to being a communist, that doesn&apos;t count and blame must be pinned on the opposition for daring to take the guy at his word.

Don&apos;t they see how ridiculous they look? Why not tell the truth? Do they think their reputation as an independent paper can be retrieved?

Pathetic.

       Understanding &apos;Angry Mobs&apos; 

By Mike Grady

Liberals are having difficulty understanding the grass roots opposition to President Obama&apos;s plans for the government takeover of the health care industry, as well as the President&apos;s loss of support since his election. Equally disconcerting to liberals was the massive turnout on September 12th to protest a Federal government that is too big, too intrusive, and far too corrupt. As one who attended the September 12th rally at the Capitol, let me offer liberals the following explanation for what is happening.

Legendary football coach Vince Lombardi said, &quot;Fatigue makes cowards out of all of us.&quot; And what are the American people these days if not fatigued? Bombarded with bad news from the 24-hour news cycle, is it any wonder that the American people are exhausted? Consider a few examples.

An estimated fifty trillion dollars or more in investor wealth is lost in a matter of weeks in the stock market collapse. Meanwhile a few speculators, Wall Street executives, and maybe even some of America&apos;s own politicians make out like bandits. The result is that the American people rightly wonder why they should bother to work hard, put money in a 529 college fund, a 401(k) retirement plan, or save for a new car if it can all be wiped away in the blink of an eye. And Americans are fatigued.

Americans are told the H1N1 swine flu virus is coming and there is little they can do to protect themselves. And Americans are scared.

A young girl is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years, repeatedly raped, made to live in a tent, and forced to be a mother to two children when she was still a child herself. Americans wonder how they can possibly protect their children from such evil. And Americans are afraid.

The Associated Press publishes a photograph of a heroic young Marine taken while he lay dying on a battlefield far from home, ignoring pleas from the young Marine&apos;s parents, the United States Marine Corps, and requests from the Secretary of Defense not to publish the photo. Concurrently, op-ed pieces in any number of news publications detail how the war in Afghanistan is lost, or that no matter the outcome, confronting America&apos;s enemies can&apos;t possibly be worth the sacrifice anyway. As a consequence, the American people question their commitment to confront Islamic terrorism and their solemn duty to pursue America&apos;s enemies far from her shores. And Americans are drained.

Medicare and Medicaid, to say nothing of Social Security, are bankrupt and the American people are told the only hope to sustain them is to accept yet another government-run healthcare program that promises even greater encroachment on their most personal freedoms. And if the American people dare to object, their own elected officials and broadcasters on the evening news label them Nazis, Brown Shirts, racists, and right-wing domestic terrorists. And the American people are shattered.

The list of attacks on the American conscience is endless. There is no doubt that the American people are fatigued and as Vince Lombardi well knew, fatigue makes cowards of us all. More importantly however, it is cowardice that the Left relies on to impose its will.

The American people have endured a decades-long effort to discredit their values and belief system and relentless attempts to make them believe their history is worthy of ridicule. The mugging began years ago with attacks on Judeo-Christian values and accusations of intolerance. It continues today with the President giving speeches overseas decrying American excess, ignorance, and arrogance, and culminates at home with political infighting over outrageous borrowing and spending by the members of Congress. Now with majorities in both the House and the Senate and control of the White House, liberals believe the ultimate goal to fundamentally change the Nation (or destroy it in the process) is finally within reach.

In the nick of time however, the American people have shaken off their shared fatigue. Try as they might, the majority of the American people simply cannot reconcile their own view of America with the views of liberals who want to radically change the Nation. In spite of the Left&apos;s efforts to convince them otherwise, the American people know without question that the United States has been the greatest force for good the world has ever known. Americans know that a strong, albeit imperfect, America isn&apos;t just good for Americans, but for the rest of the world as well.

More Americans are wiser now too and many now recognize the tactics the Left will employ to advance their agenda. More Americans finally understand that Leftists will refuse to argue the facts and will never accept responsibility for their own policies. For example, they will never acknowledge that crime, abortion, out of wedlock births, welfare claims, drug use, and a countless list of other social ills occur most often in areas where Democrats have had a lock on the political landscape for decades. When challenged, liberals will do their best to change the subject. Anyone who disagrees with liberal objectives will be shouted out of the room or otherwise intimidated. Ultimately, anyone who opposes the liberal agenda will be labeled a racist, a Nazi, or worse.

It is a formidable defense that Americans have been reluctant to engage, but they have had enough. From the financial meltdown to bailouts, from stimulus packages, to TARP, TARP II, and TARP III, from Cap and Trade to health care reform, the American people have had it with corrupt government. And they know too that the endless stream of &quot;news&quot; that inundates their daily lives is a deliberate attempt to beat them down.

After decades of abuse at the hands of the Left, the American people can clearly see the great and gathering political storm on the horizon. Two opposing forces will collide and the outcome will be critical to the future of America. On one side there is a corrupt, elitist political machine, the embodiment of politics in America. On the other side are the troubled, but still free people of the United States of America. The growing opposition to all things government is America&apos;s recognition that it requires courage, not cowardice, to preserve freedom. That liberals either cannot, or do not want to see it coming speaks to their willingness to believe that if Americans are fatigued enough, they will lack the courage to fight back against a Leftist agenda.

The electorate is weary from the unceasing attacks on the American sense of right and wrong. But make no mistake; the American people will rest to clear their collective head. While resting, perhaps Americans will further befuddle their liberal tormentors and take comfort in the words from the book of Psalms, Chapter 3, a suggestion that prior to the liberal ambush of American values would have been considered mainstream.

Lord, so many are against me. So many seek to harm me. I have so many enemies. So many say that God will never help me. But Lord, you are my shield, my glory, and my only hope. You alone can lift my head, now bowed in shame.

Then I lay down and slept in peace and woke up safely, for the Lord was watching over me. And now, although ten thousand enemies surround me on every side, I am not afraid.

The Psalms isn&apos;t meant to be a gratuitous biblical reference, but rather is meant to serve notice that Americans no longer care what politicians and a complicit media think of them. Americans are among the most benevolent people on earth, but they are tired of being mocked and lampooned for deeply held opinions and beliefs. Instinctively, Americans have always embraced their solemn duty to fight for freedom. Not easily provoked and slow to anger, the American people have always fought for what is right once called into action. It should therefore come as no surprise to anyone, least of all liberals that Americans are protesting in waves.

What politicians in general and liberals in particular don&apos;t understand is that no matter how fatigued Americans might be, Coach Lombardi&apos;s paradigm simply does not apply. Fatigued? Yes of course, many times and perhaps even still. But never have the American people been cowards. Elitist politicians don&apos;t understand what is happening because they don&apos;t want to understand it. Whether they figure it out in time to save their own political hides, or not, is immaterial. The political storm is gathering. When it hits, my money will be on the American people.

       Keeping your eye on the ball 

Aaron Gee
With the success of the recent 9/12 protests the left is running scared. The Democratic Party needs the collective eyes of the nation to be taken off the ball if they have any hope of sliding what they are pitching across the plate. Some Democrats and media simply try to ignore what happened, either under-reporting the size and scope of the protests, or going on the Sunday morning talk shows and calling the protesters wrong and in the minority. The new media is all over the story of both the 9/12 protests and the main stream medias attempt to downplay and under report the tea party events.

Joe Wilson&apos;s outburst during the joint session is also being latched on to by some Democrats in an attempt to divert attention from the success of the 9/12 project and now there is talk of censure. This will get lots of main stream media attention and there will be little talk on Capitol Hill about limited government or tea parties.

Race has always been a good &quot;go to&quot; play for the far left and now is no different. Maureen Dowd opined that the reason that Wilson dared say such a thing was that he couldn&apos;t take the fact that the president is black. The White House has rejected that argument and accepted Wilson&apos;s apology, but that isn&apos;t good enough for house democrats. Perhaps if the House spends the next week discussing race, censure, and Wilson they won&apos;t have to discuss health care, taxes, or cap and trade.

President Obama said when discussing Wilson&apos;s apology &quot;we have to get to the point where we can have a conversation about big, important issues that matter to the American people without vitriol, without name-calling without the assumption of the worst in other people&apos;s motives&quot;. How much vitriol versus conversation do you think we will see on the house floor or in the media regarding Wilson&apos;s slip? Will we have a national conversation about being respectful to the president and call out the democrats who cried &quot;no&quot; and booed President Bush? Doubtful.

The American people have been lied to quite a bit lately, from heartfelt delivery of dishonest speeches, to the media reporting on their fellow Americans. Keep your eye on the ball America.

       Another Republican Pedophile Scandal
by James Buchanan

Just when many people were thinking the Mark Foley scandal was settling down and that there couldn’t possibly be more Republican pedophiles, a new scandal has erupted. A CBS news article reports “Overseers of the House of Representatives’ program for teenage assistants this week discussed a camping trip that Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., took with two former interns and others in 1996 — an outing now under review by the Justice Department, a congressional source said Tuesday. The overseers, consisting of three lawmakers and two senior House officials, did not have any new information beyond recent news stories on the Kolbe trip. The source is familiar with the discussions but is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The conference call Monday involving the Kolbe trip shows that the people responsible for the teenage assistants’ program are casting a wider net following revelations that ex-Rep. Mark Foley was sending overly friendly e-mails and sexually explicit instant messages to former male interns known as pages.”

Many rank and file Republicans in Hogbottom, Arkansas and Flyover, Kansas had absolutely no clue that the Republican Party has an overabundance of closet Gays and that a Gay Republican pedophile scandal was even possible. George Bush and Karl Rove were perfectly happy letting little old church-going ladies vote for some truly sickening individuals. Dennis Hastert is in trouble for not throwing Foley out much earlier. Hastert’s claim that he didn’t know about the scandal was quickly contradicted by other Republicans. (According to the “Young Turks” radio show, Mr. Hastert reportedly shares his Washington DC home with a long-time male friend. Hastert’s “wife” stays in a hotel when she visits DC.)
An L.A. Times article reports “Gays hold many prominent positions in government and business in Washington. But in the GOP ranks, homosexuality is still politically risky. In fact, with the exception of the military, perhaps no institution in America has as strong a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach as the Republican Party… Minnesota state Rep. Paul Koering, a Republican who came out publicly last year. ‘The very first time I ran, I literally almost made myself sick worrying about somebody finding out I was gay.’ Congress has three openly gay members, one of them a Republican — Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who is retiring when this term ends. Kolbe acknowledged his sexual orientation in 1996 after a gay magazine was about to ‘out’ him for voting against government recognition of same-sex marriages.”

There have been persistent rumors that two of the top Republican Party’s officials, Ken Mehlman and Karl Rove, are closet Gays. One Republican politician, Michael Huffington came close to becoming a Senator for California and few people knew he was a closet Gay. There is a rumor that there is “A List” of Gay Republican politicians and operatives, who may soon be outed to shake up the Republican base. The Gay pedophile scandal appears to have hit the accelerator on ruining the GOP’s reputation.

The L.A. Times also reported ” ‘While pro-homosexual activists like to claim that pedophilia is a completely distinct orientation from homosexuality, evidence shows a disproportionate overlap between the two,’ Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said this week in a message to supporters.” The Family Research Institute is one of the few resources on the web, which talks about actual facts and statistics about homosexuals. The Republican Party has only three openly Gay Congressmen, but it now has two pedophile scandals. One thing seems certain, there a lot more closet Gays in the GOP and the pedophile scandal may yet claim more Republicans.

       The left either fails to, or refuses, to understand that milquetoast international diplomacy simply emboldens the predators...

 Obama believes the bears won&apos;t kill him 

Neil Braithwaite

Remember Timothy Treadwell, the bear enthusiast and environmentalist who lived for many seasons with the coastal grizzly bears in Alaska? And, remember what happened to Timothy and his girlfriend that fateful season in 2003 while they were living among the grizzlies? Sadly, those same grizzlies Timothy had grown to love and understand killed and partially ate both him and his girlfriend.

You see, while Timothy understood the danger involved with getting so close to a wild predator, he never really imagined those bears would kill him. Any rational thought of imminent danger Timothy may have had previously, was overruled by his obsession to live with the wild grizzlies year after year. Unfortunately for Timothy and his girlfriend, the grizzlies finally did what all predators do -- kill and eat.

With the Obama administration&apos;s latest cowering move to the Kremlin to abandon a missile defense plan for Europe, our new president continues his Treadwell-like behavior, on a foreign policy path with many predatory leaders who both articulate and pose an imminent threat to America. President Obama does perceive the danger to America in getting close to these murderous dictators, but like Timothy Treadwell, he refuses to allow sound reasoning to interfere with his overwhelming obsession to befriend them all.

But while Treadwell chose to endanger only himself and his girlfriend, President Obama is making a clear choice to endanger all of America with his reckless foreign policy.

Foreign leaders like Chavez, Ahmedinejad, Kim, Castro, and yes, even Putin, to name a few, are all predators just like the Alaskan grizzly. And all predators have habits and instincts that make them unpredictable, dangerous and eventually deadly.

Predators are also very patient and cunning when it comes to selecting their prey. They usually seek out the weak or injured so they can increase their chances of a successful kill. The predators President Obama is trying to befriend and get close to are being patient and cunning with him as well.

In less than ten months, President Obama&apos;s new policies have taken our country from being the world&apos;s strongest superpower to a weak and vulnerable nation being singled out as a prime target by these predators. Like the plight of Timothy Treadwell, it&apos;s only a matter of time for America before these predators do what they do -- kill and eat.

       Watch out, lefties...the right is BACK

 The Not-So-Silent Majority 

By Bruce Walker

Forty years ago, a term was coined to describe the voices of ordinary, patriotic, religious Americans who sought to live their lives in peace: the &quot;Silent Majority.&quot; In November 1969, almost four decades ago, Vice President Agnew made the first direct assault on the leftist media in his Des Moines speech, which noted that almost everything that Americans knew of politics and current events was filtered through the newsrooms of the three television networks. An excerpt from that famous speech describes the leftist prison of those who govern our news:

&quot;We can deduce that these men read the same newspapers. They draw their political and social views from the same sources. Worse, they talk constantly to one another, thereby providing artificial reinforcement to their shared viewpoints. Do they allow their biases to influence the selection and presentation of the news?&quot;

What has changed in the last forty years? Does the vast corporate and institutional wealth, which alone props up the left, still skew the news, the entertainment, the information presented as fact by those who govern the television networks, Hollywood, academia, nonprofit organizations like ACORN, the American Bar Association, AARP, and labor unions? Of course! Agnew later offered some concrete suggestions on how these elitists could make themselves more aware of how ordinary Americans felt. But, of course, the left has never seen its role as understanding and reflecting America but rather transforming the &quot;mistake&quot; of America into the left&apos;s image of a socialist utopia.

Those of us who recall the Reagan years also recall the absolute hatred expressed for Reagan by these media hacks. They gasped when he called the Soviet evil empire an &quot;Evil Empire.&quot; They accused him of senility, of ignorance, or everything nasty that they could dream up. How shocked were these same media representatives when President Reagan died five years ago, having been virtually invisible to America for more than a decade, at the huge numbers of Americans who waited patiently for hours to view our dead leader? Without prompting by the leftist media, without more than obligatory notice by the elites, Americans openly mourned this great leader in numbers larger than any president since Lincoln. Even John Kerry, who never had a kind word to say about Reagan as president, felt obliged to pay his phony tribute.

Compare this to the highly publicized, openly political funeral of Teddy Kennedy. The elitist Left would not permit us a moment away from eulogizing this inconsequential younger son of a shady political dynasty. He had been very much in the public eye for many years, giving a major address at the Democratic National Convention last year. But aside for manufactured sentiment, only the politically cynical really showed admiration for Teddy.

Rasmussen in a September 11 poll confirmed how Americans really feel about ideology: all political labels except &quot;being like Reagan&quot; are in growing disfavor; the term &quot;progressive&quot; (a leftist hiding behind a different moniker) is becoming unpopular; and only fifteen percent of Americans consider being called &quot;liberal&quot; a positive. What Rasmussen reports fits perfectly with Gallup, which recently showed conservatives outnumbering liberals and Battleground Polls, which for almost a decade have consistently shown sixty percent of Americans identify themselves as conservatives (not liberals and not moderates.)

The Silent Majority forty years ago was cowed, afraid, and ashamed. It members, the majority of good Americans, felt the sting of being called a racist, sexist, fascist, or whatever other casual insult the Left sought to hurl. The voices of conservative American now include many black Americans, huge numbers of women, lots of Jews, and more Hispanics. These Americans have seen how the left mistreats Clarence Thomas and Sarah Palin: they know that any bigotry that exists in American politics is primarily on the left.

Through nimble media which move much faster and more accurately than the clumsy giants of doctrinaire Leftism, the Silent Majority now increasingly commands the attention of engaged Americans, while the New York Times, CNN, PBS, and Hollywood are slouching toward the carnival freak show of American media.

The Silent Majority transcends political party. Its members see the Republican Party as simply a mechanism to carry out its agenda, just like the elitist left sees the Democratic Party as a vehicle to advance a sort of surreal political madness (just ask honest liberals like Joe Lieberman.) So when President Bush whipped Republicans to unite with Democrats immigration &quot;reform,&quot; the Silent Majority yelled &quot;No!&quot; with a voice heard up and down the corridors of Washington power.

This group of engaged citizens, this vast majority of the American people, this corps of hardened veterans in the left&apos;s war on God, family, and country, see in the left a foe, not a friend. The Silent Majority understands that the left here, like the terrorists abroad, leave no options but defeat or victory. Led only by common hopes and shared principles, trusting few in Washington but trusting the heart of America implicitly, now talking and writing and organizing by the tens of millions in hundreds of thousands of small groups, what was once call the Silent Majority is now, most definitely, the Not-So-Silent-Majority.

       Hmmm...Neptune loves posting about child molesters...how&apos;d he miss this one? Oh, that&apos;s right, it&apos;s not a conservative!

 Former SEIU boss jailed, media yawns 

Thomas Lifson
Imagine if an official of a major conservative organization received 25 year prison sentence for child molestation. Would the media avert their eyes? Yet the head of the Sacramento chapter of major Obama ally, the Service Employees International Union, a man who represented thousands of state employees, received this sentence earlier this week, and the media yawned. Here is an account from the website of a local television station in Sacramento:

A former union official and California Department of Insurance employee was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years in prison after entering no contest pleas to charges of child molestation, possession of child pornography, and manufacturing child pornography.

Jaime Enrique Feliciano, who served as a chapter president of Service Employees International Union Local 1000, which represents thousands of Sacramento-area state workers, had previous convictions for child molestation and failure to register as a sex offender.

       Here is a good example of how liberals seem incapable of adding 2 and 2. No wonder they&apos;re so screwed up...

 Arianna&apos;s ‘duh&apos; moment 

Thomas Lifson
The cluelessness of the left on display this morning, in the juxtaposition of two articles this morning. First, Michael Gerson in the Washington Post, on the loss of the former courting rituals, as sexual liberation encourages earlier onset of sexual activity, sequential intimate relationships, and the like:

How is this working out? Not very well. Relationships defined by lower levels of commitment are, not unexpectedly, more likely to break up. Three-quarters of children born to cohabiting parents will see their parents split up by the time they turn 16, compared with about one-third of children born to married parents. So apart from the counsel of cold showers or &quot;let the good times roll,&quot; is there any good advice for those traversing the relational wilderness? Religion and morality contribute ideals of character. But social science also indicates some rough, practical wisdom. [snip]

... the age of first marriage is important to marital survival and happiness. Teen marriage is generally a bad idea, with much higher rates of divorce. Romeo and Juliet were, in fact, young fools. Later marriage has been one of the reasons for declining national divorce rates. But this does not mean the later the better. Divorce rates trend downward until leveling off in the early 20s. But people who marry after 27 tend to have less happy marriages -- perhaps because partners are set in their ways or have unrealistically high standards. The marital sweet spot seems to be in the early to mid-20s.

Third, having a series of low-commitment relationships does not bode well for later marital commitment. Some of this expresses preexisting traits -- people who already have a &quot;nontraditional&quot; view of commitment are less likely to be committed in marriage. But there is also evidence, according to Wilcox, that multiple failed relationships can &quot;poison one&apos;s view of the opposite sex.&quot; Serial cohabitation trains people for divorce. In contrast, cohabitation by engaged couples seems to have no adverse effect on eventual marriage. [emphasis added]

The second article comes from Arianna Huffington, puzzled at the decline in female happiness:

According to study after study, women are becoming more and more unhappy. This drop in happiness is found in women across the social and economic landscape. It doesn&apos;t matter what their marital status is, how much money they make, whether or not they have children, their ethnic background, or the country they live in. Women around the world are in a funk.

And it&apos;s not because of the multitude of crises we are facing. Women&apos;s happiness has been on a downward trend since the early 1970s, when the General Social Survey, a landmark study, began examining the social attitudes of women and men -- who, by the way, have gotten progressively happier over the years.

When you think about all that has happened over the last four decades -- with women securing greater opportunity, greater achievement, greater influence, and more money -- the decline in our collective state of mind seems to defy logic, and raises the vexing question: What in the world is going on?

Ms. Huffington should consult Mr. Gerson.

       Desperate measures on the left 

Thomas Lifson
Let any conservative in the media have an effect, and a counterattack will come from medial lapdogs of the left. Now the Glenn Beck has drawn political blood, he has a bulls-eye on his forehead. Poltico notices that the hyping of an alleged rivalry between Rush Limbaugh and Beck is underway, ignoring the fact that Rush has appeared on Glenn&apos;s Fox News show recently. Not exactly the behavior of someone scared of losing his dominance. Of course, the media has been demonizing Rush ever since he first succeeded in national syndication. Now they have a new game to play with Beck, and the clumsy attempt to gin up a rivalry out of whole cloth.

The left is quite properly terrified of the widespread and broad-based populist movement building in America in opposition to Obama&apos;s transformation strategy. They never counted on this happening. Expert astroturfers themselves, they are not really familiar with the notion of a genuinely popular political movement. In their minds, a political movement needs ideological direction from above, financial support, and a network of allied groups in order to succeed. They can&apos;t deal with a movement in which leaders generate themselves spontaneously out of a deep grounding in the American founding tradition.

[Politico quoted Mark Levin, whose Liberty and Tyranny has sold one million copies. The political ramifications of this book will not sink in to intellectuals for at least a generation, but it has empowered activists, enabling them to awaken friends, neighbors, and family to the nature of the paradigm shift underway.]

The lack of a single charismatic leader makes the movement difficult to fight. So they need to pick a target, personalize it, and freeze it, in the Alinskyite formulation.

Coming in the wake of CNN&apos;s studious ignoring of the ACORN tapes -- the biggest political story of the week -- this sort of attack backfires. When Jon Stewart is making fun of you, your circulation and advertising are falling off a cliff, and your cable news operation is even whipped by MSNBC, this is pathetic.

       The left still doesn&apos;t get it 

By Geoffrey P. Hunt


Despite steady progress in achieving their ambition, lefties have acquired neither clue nor interest in how things actually work. Imagine the destruction when the revolucion has transferred power from the oppressor class to them. Suffice that whatever works now isn&apos;t controlled by lefties, which is why whatever does work, works.

The lefties&apos; only work experience has been organizing protests, crafting slogans and manipulating the media. But regular Americans, in addition to their day jobs in building America and making it work have now also learned the stagecraft of protesting, sloganeering and leveraging the alternative media, while upstaging the mainstream media.

Unlike regular Americans, lefties have never produced anything that works -- neither in the private nor public sector. They have no frame of reference to assess whether their new world order will work; they haven&apos;t participated in building what works today. Nor have they ever built any sort of successful competing socio-economic model on any scale to show the rest of us that their future state on a larger scale could work.

More frightening, lefties don&apos;t care. Their only interest is to exercise the power of overthrow and erasure. David Horowitz, erstwhile lefty , now turned socio-political critic of the left, reminded Glenn Beck in a recent interview that the end game of Obama&apos;s radical movement is simply power. Power has been the goal of the leftist movement for nearly a hundred years, most fervently in America since the late 1950s, today more than ever as they finally have critical mass to achieve their centennial ambition.

In the 1960s, it was &quot;tear down the house, we&apos;ll figure out how the plumbing works later.&quot; Of course the radicals then were more of an academic curiosity and convenient villain for the so-called silent majority than serious challengers to what works. It was easier then to dismiss those radicals as fringe socio-engineers, pivoting off the baroque sexual politics of poets, painters and librettists in the 1930s. Yet even WH Auden, leading lefty poet extraordinaire whose &quot;making, knowing and judging&quot; marked his works in the 1930s, freely using his art to drive political speech, had largely abandoned that propaganda genre a decade later .

The politics of oppression and grievance mongering, focusing on gaining enough power to expropriate what the oppressor class owns -- capital, means of production and accumulated wealth -- has found its renewed stride mostly due to economic dislocation brought about by globalization. Riding on a wave of generic discontent, the radical class still has no idea how capital is formed or wealth created -- much less once drained and dissipated how to rejuvenate and re-bloom.

They deny any suggestion, despite abundant evidence, that accumulated wealth, whether from small business owners, inventors, entrepreneurs or major corporations, once confiscated and redistributed for consumption rather than reinvestment, cannot be replaced, at least very easily. And their quest for power knows no limits. The means to be used has been laid out in their street manifesto, Saul Alinsky&apos;s &quot;Rules For Radicals&quot;, resulting in the likes of Van Jones placed within walking distance of the West Wing. All quite deliberate according to script.

Punish capital formation and profits by unrelenting taxes and wage and price controls for anyone not a union member; control energy production and distribution; legislate human behavior through government health care and strictly ration broad band communications to only friendly messengers. All the while manipulate the media with one non-stop message: we will deliver social justice. That&apos;s the plan. And as Karl Rove has said, once the left controls health care, they will own the emotional dimension of the national debate. Anyone who would then oppose national health care, trim it or reform it would be hostile de facto to advancing social justice.

Every year the debate would be framed around the spending priorities for government health care. The left would occupy the high ground commanding enough votes from the permanently aggrieved, the &quot;take but never pay&quot; class who pay no taxes, convinced they are victims of racism and capitalist exploitation.

It is this class of the permanently aggrieved, with nothing more to lose, unaffected by 50 years of unrequited loyalty to the Democrats, who still eagerly await another handout, more entitlements, perhaps even reparations, the grand prize. Libertarians and conservatives would be arguing to deaf ears the merits on freedom of choice, limited government and financial liquidity.

In the meantime health care as a political and natural right will be the established norm championed by the left in achieving social justice -- their shorthand for redistributing economic means and denying individual liberties. Voters who pay taxes, thus broadly identified in the oppressor class, know if they lose the health care battle they will never regain enough traction to repudiate the agenda of expropriation and revenge promised to the permanently aggrieved through the left&apos;s usual dramatic theatrics, deux ex machina. While the American system admittedly hasn&apos;t always worked for everybody, its replacement wouldn&apos;t work for anyone.

Which is why these are perilous times. Which is why those who have the most to lose have finally said &quot;Enough!&quot; Which is why the health care debate has been the tipping point. Which is why the radical agenda is being derailed by regular Americans beginning with health care.

The firestorm in full force from regular Americans at town hall meetings in August was captured by the new media, YouTube, its origins a counter cultural techno-phenomenon now owned by millions of everyday people. YouTube along with all the other unrestrained ubiquitous web communications have replicated the hundreds, perhaps thousands of pamphlets and broadsheets from nearly every city, village and town in the pre-Revolutionary War period as chronicled by Bernard Bailyn in &quot;The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution.&quot;

The &quot;Guns of August&quot; so-to-speak and the September march on the Mall reaffirmed the unique American character mixing free expression and pragmatism-- knowing what works and being prepared to defend it. Regular folks countered the ideology of power, corruption, ineptitude and sacrifice of individual liberty, using their voice to reject the radical left&apos;s path to a grim collectivism.

&quot;Don&apos;t Tread On Me&quot; worked well enough for Benjamin Franklin in the 1770s. It is now enjoying a fitting reprise.

       Examining liberalism? I have a question; this has puzzled me for years. How is it you good lefties can do something students of the mind say is impossible, namely, hold two contradictory thoughts in your head at the same time. You do this all the time.

More and bigger government. The history of the world is that more and bigger government always deprives the individual of freedom and economic opportunity. Yet you refuse to accept this, claiming &quot; it will work this time; our plan is different.&quot;

Conservatives are oppressors. Yet you are the ones who call names, spew the hatred, refuse to answer for your incivility, and divide people by race.

You never discuss why your answers fail.

You claim about abortion, &quot; It&apos;s a woman&apos;s body and her choice.&quot; No, it isn&apos;t. That child is very carefully separated from the mother&apos;s body; the two bodies never exchange blood. The child has an entirely different genetic pattern from the mother, so it cannot possibly be her body. These two facts make it obvious to anyone with a fifth grade education that pregnancy is not about
&quot; just the woman.&quot;

How do you do this? Obviously, by not being grounded in reality, or even caring about reality and truth. Because its about power and control, isn&apos;t it? Its about the very idea of anyone running their own life being abhorrent to you. Yet the bulk of you will be enslaved by those you chose to give the power to. How hard is it for you to see that?

       Reactionary Liberalism and the Peanut Narcissist 

Ralph Alter

Reactionary: adjective

1. Vehemently, often fanatically opposing progress or reform die-hard, mossbacked See politics.
2. Clinging to obsolete ideas: backward, unprogressive.

The term reactionary is most often used to describe conservative politicians. I have purposely omitted the terms &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;ultra-conservative&quot; from the choice of synonyms provided above. It seems that the modern liberal movement in American politics is the one &quot;opposing progress or reform,&quot; especially regarding race relations. The reactionary inclinaton is most visible in the fulminations of the legacy television network news divisions and the editorial policies of the New York Times, the Washington Post and their acolytes.

Despite the metamorphosis of American culture in the 20th century provided by civil rights law, integration, and Affirmative Action policies in business, education and government, reactionary liberals continue to pretend that the United States remains locked in a quasi-Jim Crow embrace.

To their detriment, the reactionary liberal media has elevated former (one is tempted to use the word disgraced or at least disgraceful) President Jimmy Carter as their figurehead. The peanut narcissist&apos;s remarks reflect the refusal by reactionary liberals to accept that criticisms leveled against the policies of Barack Obama are substantive in nature:

&quot;I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man, that he&apos;s African-American,&quot; Carter said in an NBC interview. &quot;Racism ... still exists, and I think it&apos;s bubbled up to the surface because of a belief among many white people, not just in the South but around the country, that African-Americans are not qualified to lead this great country.&quot; l


The refusal to accept objective criticism is just one of many traits shared by Carter and Obama. An unfounded faith in one&apos;s own moral superiority based on intellectual vanity and narcissism are shared by both Democrats as well. The circumstances leading to their unlikely elevation to the office of POTUS are quite similar too. Like Barack Obama, Carter was elected in a flurry of reactionary liberalism whipped up by a complicit media. While Obama floated in on a wave of Bush Derangement Syndrome, Jimmy Carter squeaked into office riding the lingering media feeding frenzy provided by the bloated corpse of the Watergated Nixon administration. The woeful legacy of Carter&apos;s Presidency is beginning to look like a template for the abject failure of the Obama Presidency:

&quot;The former President is not content having left office with high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment. Nor is he content with having signed into law the Community Reinvestment Act -- strengthened by President Bill Clinton -- which played a major roll in the eventual housing market meltdown. Nor is he content with having cut the legs from under the Shah of Iran, which led to the establishment of the Islamic theocracy in Iran -- a state that pursues a nuclear weapon, funds the terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah, and continues to undermine the fledgling democracy of Iraq. Nor is he content -- as ex-President -- with writing a book in which he likened the state of Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians to South Africa under apartheid.&quot; (ibid)


No, Mr. Carter extends his moral opprobrium of criticisms of the Obama administration as a sort of smoke-screen to deflect fully legitimate questions about the honesty, integrity and ability of the sitting President and his assembled staff. Is it racism to criticize the identical failings in Obama that we abhorred in the Carter administration? The sitting President certainly has even higher unemployment than the Carter administration, while his monetary policies suggest that high inflation and higher interest rates are coming soon. Obama&apos;s policies toward Iran and the elimination of the missile shield for Eastern Europe couldn&apos;t be more simpatico with Carter&apos;s approach if Zbigniew Brzezinski were National Security Advisor again.

Carter and the reactionary liberal media that supports him clearly long for the days when the race card was trump. Prior to the development of the blogosphere and the creation of Fox News, media cries of racism or its doppelganger, McCarthyism, went unchallenged, or at least the challenges were unheard by most Americans. The rise of the alternative media assures that those who attempt to end debate with the charge of racism may just be dealt out of the next hand. Any chance of history casting a kinder, perhaps forgiving eye upon the miserable failure of the Jimmy Carter Presidency is gone. The peanut narcissist should have &quot;gone gently into the night&quot; of history without the preening self-importance and smug moralizing demonstrated every time he sees a microphone or picks up a pen.

With his strident assumption of moral superiority and defective judgment hogging national headlines, Mr. Carter has assured that he will be able to contemplate the derision he has earned before he shuffles off this mortal coil. Once again the reactionary liberal movement has over-played its hand and thereby rendered itself and its useful idiot, Jimmy Carter, into laughing stocks.

       Obama and the Last Hurrah of Liberalism 

By Steve McCann

Sometimes in the history of a nation what appears to be an action that could lead to long term disaster may, in fact, be its long term salvation. A case in point: the election of Barack Obama as President and the Democrats in full control of the Congress. To be certain the far left domination of government was not a situation to be wished for but in a perverse way one that was necessary.

Over the past fifty years, regardless of who was in the White House or in charge of Congress, no one has been able to halt the incessant spread of left-wing radicalism in our institutions and the uncontrolled spending and growth of government. When a President as accomplished as Ronald Reagan was unable to do so it is apparent that no future Republican President or Congress, short of major national catastrophe, will ever be able to fully turn back this tide as they cannot overcome the apathy of the people and the hostility of a partisan media, entertainment establishment, academia and federal bureaucracies.

A long as the American people remained largely disengaged the damage done to the society as a whole and to the long term financial health of the country was unknown to the vast majority of the population. This indifference has begun to show some change as the reality of the nation&apos;s future comes into focus, but that reality has started to come to the fore only as the result of the policies being perused by a far left government.

Today, thanks to a confluence of two factors, the opportunity exists to reverse the course we have been on and change the political power structure in the country.

The first: the emergence of alternative news sources to once and for all break the stranglehold of the dissemination of news by the traditional outlets dominated by the left.

The second: The election of a radical left-wing President and a Congress controlled by the same radical element of the Democratic Party.

President Obama is an offspring of the 1960&apos;s radical movement. He has spent most of his life surrounded and tutored by members of this group. He is the culmination of the ideal stealth candidate able by his gift of rhetoric, race and good timing to ascend to the office of President. The left found, as Joe Biden put it &quot;a clean and articulate&quot; nominee with surface charm and charisma able to fool enough citizens into voting for him.

A trait common to those on the far left is an inability to have any humility; there is an intense conviction of superiority both intellectually and in their capability to rule the masses. The true believers are incapable of hiding their philosophy and, once elected, are convinced that nearly everyone does or should share their dedication to the power of a central government. Those that do not conform will be demonized. These extremists will move heaven and earth to achieve their ends regardless of any long term consequences and cannot avoid shouting from the rooftops what they are doing as tribute to themselves.

The determination of Obama and the Congress to exploit the financial and economic crisis in order to pass their radical agenda has had the effect of kicking over the rocks and exposing for all to see the undermining of the social and fiscal foundation of the nation by the left-wing radicals in Congress, the Administration and within many of our institutions.

Would the country be as aware of the following if not for an extremist government in power in Washington? Acorn and the &quot;community organizer&quot; groups have been revealed to be nothing more than corrupt partisan hacks exploiting the poor and the taxpayers. The unions and their leaders exposed as power hungry ideologues with no interest in the long term well-being of their members. The mainstream media&apos;s willingness to lose all credibility with the vast majority of the public with its not so subtle cheerleading for their preferred politician has become obvious to all. The Democratic Party, at one time the self-declared defender of the little guy, has openly declared war on small business and capitalism. The Democratic members of Congress have been revealed to be indifferent to the voters, incapable of reading bills and fully in the pockets of liberal special interests groups

Further the Administration has blithely declared a tripling of the national debt over the next 10 years as if it were immaterial. President Obama has championed &quot;health care reform&quot; and a &quot;carbon tax&quot; in an attempt to control the day-to-day lives of the American people. There are now 32 advisors (czars), to the President, most being left-wing ideologues, with the power to implement his agenda, none of whom have been approved by the Senate.

While the readers of the American Thinker, viewers of Fox News and the listeners to Rush Limbaugh may be expected to be aware of these factors, now with the backdrop of unfettered spending, the high jobless rates and the potential for national bankruptcy more and more of the general public has become aware of the radical nature of the present government.

President Obama and his Party have failed to understand the basic character of the American people and the many polls taken over the years showing this to be a right of center country. They further underestimated the power of the alternate media before they had an opportunity to silence it. While the timing may have been there to have to have a &quot;moderate&quot; Barack Obama elected President, the timing to turn the United States into a bastion of socialism was not. The infiltration of the various institutions by the left has not been in place long enough to change the character of the majority of the population and the use of the strategy of guilt to intimidate the American citizens has run its course, it has been overused.

To date the damage done has been considerable, but it is not irreversible. In essence Barack Obama and the Congress won their offices too early in the history of our nation to achieve all their objectives; by doing so and overreaching this left wing government has given the country an opportunity to awaken from its 50 year slumber and repair the foundation. Only a radical Presidency and Congress could have achieved this before it was too late. The only questions that remain: will the aroused and more knowledgeable populace continue to be aware and elect those that will make the changes necessary and will we as a nation take advantage of this potential reprieve?

       Wow. The left is getting &quot;slaughtered&quot; in Germany&apos;s elections. Even in strongly socialist Europe, they recognize that conservative/right wing politicians, and pro-business policies, are what makes for a better economy.

 Germany veers right - socialists &apos;slaughtered&apos; 

Rick Moran
This may be a harbinger of things to come or, just as likely, a purely German reaction to the failed programs of the social democrats. But Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s return to power has come with a price. Her center right Christian Democrats saw their majority shrink but in a big surprise, the pro-business Free Democratic Party increased their share of deputies in the Bundestag and Merkel will be forced to make concessions to the FDP if she wants them in her governing coalition.

As America veers hard left, Germany and the rest of Europe appears ready to lurch rightward; and how ironic is that?

It should be noted that Germany - and Europe&apos;s &quot;right&quot; is hardly conservatism as we know it in the US. But perhaps most significant in these German election results was the &quot;slaughter&quot; of the social democrats and their leftist allies.

Claus Christian Malzahn writing in Spiegel Online:

Nevertheless, the big loser of Sunday&apos;s election is still undoubtedly the center-left Social Democrats. Their result is below even the historic low that the party suffered in 1953 and which took it years to recover from. After 11 years in government, the party, whose status as one of Germany&apos;s two main parties seems to be in question since Sunday&apos;s election, is going into the opposition. The party is only 10 percentage points ahead of its upstart far-left rival, the Left Party. The Left Party is the result of a merger between the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) -- the successor to the communist party that ruled East Germany -- and WASG, a group of trade unionists and disgruntled former SPD members based in western Germany, and has managed to significantly eat into the SPD&apos;s share of the vote since it was founded in 2007.

The mood that is now gripping the SPD could easily be described as panic. Already on Sunday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier staked his claim to be the party&apos;s floor leader in parliament. By doing so, he wants to send out a message of continuity during this hour of worst possible defeat. But the developments on Sunday night look less like continuity than a break with the past. Germans are experiencing the end of an SPD as they have known it since the 1960s.

Right of center parties are also gaining ground in most of the rest of Europe and have been for more than a year. Perhaps more than &quot;conservative,&quot; these parties are seen as &quot;pro-business&quot; and in severe economic downturns, it makes sense to elect people who will promote policies to help companies start hiring again and get the economy moving.

Might this be a recipe for success in 2010 for Republicans? Time will tell whether the GOP can get its act together in order to come up with a coherent message that will convince the American people that Republicans have the ideas that will get us out of this mess created by too much spending, too much taxing, too much government interference in the economy, and too much Obama.

       ...and:

 Another Blow to European Leftism 

By Bruce Walker

Angela Merkel squeaked out a plurality in the German Bundestag four years ago and formed, along with the leftist Social Democrat Party, a grand coalition to govern Germany. Those conservatives who expected a major change in Germany were bound to be disappointed: the parties of the left in Germany formed an actual majority in the Bundestag, and Merkel&apos;s Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) could not form a government to actually move Germany away from collectivism with the market-oriented Free Democrats.

All that changed on September 27. The German general election followed almost exactly the script written by several years of polling data in Germany. The Christian Democrats substantially increased their strength in the Bundestag and, in alliance with the also robust Free Democrat Party, Merkel can form a right of center government in Germany. The Christian Democrats remain the strongest party in the Bundestrat, that part of the German national legislature which reflects the prerogatives and powers of German states. This means that Merkel can now pursue those policies that she actually feels will help revitalize the private sector in Germany and that German foreign policy, traditionally the province of the Free Democrats in the CDU/FDP coalition, will be at least as sympathetic to us as in the past government.

Many pundits will, quite rightly, argue that the victory of the CDU/CSU and Merkel in Germany, like the pending victory of the Conservative Party and Cameron in the United Kingdom, means something very different than a conservative victory in America. These pundits are right. A &quot;conservative&quot; party in Europe is not nearly as conservative as a conservative party in America. But there is another point to these European elections: the left commands a rapidly shrinking percentage of the voters in European nations.

The percentage of the vote which the Social Democrat Party received in this German general election was the lowest since the end of the Second World War (or the lowest percentage in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.) The historic left, the socialist left of Barack Obama and the Democrat Party, is wildly unpopular in the most important democracy in Europe. The Merkel message of lower taxes, nuclear energy, and market solutions to economic problems resonated with voters.

What is true in Germany is also true in other major democracies in Europe. The Conservative Party in Britain has been winning local elections all over the United Kingdom and the polls for the last two years have shown that Gordon Brown and his Labour Party will receive historically low percentages of the vote in the next British general election, sometime before next July.

The disillusionment that Europeans feel for old style socialism seems clear. Whether right of center governments will be able to transform electoral majorities into real change is another matter. Certainly Maggie Thatcher was able to do just that in Britain twenty years ago. Americans, after eight years of Bush Republicanism know the perils of having a nominally &quot;conservative&quot; government which often tries to pander to the left.

Conservatives should not expect miracles out of Merkel. She, and Germany as a whole, wants good relations with Russia. That is not a failure of conservatism in Germany but rather a reflection of how Germans across the board view Russia after the end of communism and the liberation of the Warsaw Pact nations. That is not good for America, but Russia -- which has only half the area and population of the old Soviet Union and has none of the Warsaw Pact satellites, is not a real military threat to America.

But there is no doubt that Merkel is as good as America can expect from Germany in supporting Israel (the German Chancellor was granted the unusual honor of addressing, as a head of government and not a head of state, the Knesset, last year.) Schroeder, the Social Democrat who ran Germany before Merkel, went out of his way to poke America in the eye; Merkel shows no such animus. Angela Merkel has also been portrayed as a right-wing extremist on social issues, although in American political terms, she is definitely in the middle of the road on abortion, gay rights, and similar social issues.

Anyone who belongs to the CDU (Christian Democratic Party) or the CSU (Christian Social Union -- the Bavarian counterpart of the CDU) is overtly religious, and although it is easy to overstate how much this affects the policies and philosophies of the CDU-CSU, the parties to the left of it all almost palpably hostile to religion. The SDP and its ancestor parties going back to the beginning of the Twentieth Century were overtly atheistic.

The victory of Merkel, her party, and her party&apos;s Free Democrat allies is not a triumph of American conservatism in Europe, but it is an emphatic and clear rejection of the political alternatives to religious belief, individual liberty, and free economic markets. We are not winning in democratic elections around the world, yet. But, in many places, our enemies have stopped winning. Sunday was another blow to European leftism.

       Another example of the damnable hypocrisy of the left...

 White House, lefty blogs going ape over righty rejoicing at Obama&apos;s failure 

Rick Moran
If you did not support the president&apos;s trip to Denmark to lobby for the Olympics coming to Chicago, you are an unpatriotic moron.

If you opposed bringing the games here, you hate America.

Those are the deep thoughts brought to us by the netnuts in blogdom and even the White House , who equated RNC Chair Michael Steele&apos;s opposition to Obama&apos;s trip (that 43% of Americans opposed also) with not &quot;rooting&quot; for America.

Now some might think it hypocritical for the left to point to anyone and say they hate America or wish America to fail. Given the incredible crap George Bush had to put up for 8 years from this crew, it might behoove our lefty friends to recall their own cheering on the insurgency in Iraq, gloating over American casualties, and generally acting as if losing the war would be a good thing.

And when they protest a bit too much that it&apos;s simply not true, remind them of what Gary Kamiya wrote in Salon Magazine as our troops were rolling to victory over Saddam&apos;s army: (Via Ace )

 I have a confession: I have at times, as the war has unfolded, secretly wished for things to go wrong. Wished for the Iraqis to be more nationalistic, to resist longer. Wished for the Arab world to rise up in rage. Wished for all the things we feared would happen. I&apos;m not alone: A number of serious, intelligent, morally sensitive people who oppose the war have told me they have had identical feelings.
Some of this is merely the result of pettiness -- ignoble resentment, partisan hackdom, the desire to be proved right and to prove the likes of Rumsfeld wrong, irritation with the sanitizing, myth-making American media. That part of it I feel guilty about, and disavow. But some of it is something trickier: It&apos;s a kind of moral bet-hedging, based on a pessimism not easy to discount, in which one&apos;s head and one&apos;s heart are at odds.
Many antiwar commentators have argued that once the war started, even those who oppose it must now wish for the quickest, least bloody victory followed by the maximum possible liberation of the Iraqi people. But there is one argument against this: What if you are convinced that an easy victory will ultimately result in a larger moral negative -- four more years of Bush, for example, with attendant disastrous policies, or the betrayal of the Palestinians to eternal occupation, or more imperialist meddling in the Middle East or elsewhere? 

Lefty blogs today are full of accusations that the right hates America and hopes Obama fails. How one can connect the two - tying the person of the president to whether one loves their country or not - escaped much of the left for the last 8 years. They have suddenly discovered that they love America in the same way that the right does - at least as long as Obama is the president.
So let&apos;s allow them their spite. No one takes their charge that the right hates America seriously - I mean, really now. Who are they kidding? They just spent the last 8 years telling the right that their blind love of America was destroying us. Now all of a sudden the right hates the country? Phooey.
I devoutly wish that the left&apos;s discovery that they love America the same way that conservatives love her will be a permanent thing. But somehow, I think the next president - whoever she may be - will cause liberals to revert to type and see our flaws all to clearly while ignoring our virtues.

       The Trauma of Obama 

By Robin of Berkeley

A new, conservative friend cracks up when she hears my phone message. As a therapist, I&apos;m required to state, &quot;If this is a psychiatric emergency, please call 911.&quot;

Roaring with laughter, she says, &quot;Robin, the whole country is having a psychiatric emergency!&quot;

And she&apos;s right, because people running this country are off: off balance, off-world, off-putting, off their meds.

Gallows humor, a knot in your stomach when Obama speaks, poor sleep. Your body is telling you that something is wrong.

Even out here, things are starting to feel spooky. While it&apos;s always weird central in Berkeley, now there&apos;s a malaise in the air.

Yes, there are plenty of people so far into the communist schtick, they would gladly sacrifice their children, their granny, and their life savings for the Left.

But most liberals still want their houses, jobs, Hondas and iPods. When they voted for Obama, they weren&apos;t giving a thumbs up for the country to go the way of Ché.

So there&apos;s a strange, foreboding vibe in these parts; that creepy feeling you get when you know there&apos;s bad news ahead.

Many liberals look dazed and confused because they have no language, no information, no way of understanding what in the world is going on.

Interestingly, there&apos;s this eerie silence about Obama. You don&apos;t hear a peep about him. Or course, liberals are still foaming at the mouth about Sarah Palin, tea baggers, birthers, and all things conservative.

But adulation for Obama: Missing in Action. A telling sign: the life size black and white cardboard doll of Obama in a storefront near my office has been taken down. Where did it go -- to the local recycling center with other discarded Obamabilia?

Because I&apos;m a psychotherapist, I&apos;m intrigued by what goes on inside and outside. People not only suffer because of neurotic minds, but because of what people do to us when they abuse their power.

The family dramas, problems at work, or dysfunction in D.C. unnerve us. As Presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis, indelicately put it, &quot;Fish rots from the head down.&quot;

We have people at the highest echelons of our government who may be rotting this nation. They espouse twisted notions of humanity, like de-evolution and forced sterilization. They eat, drink, and sleep revenge.

They are throwing much of this country, at least those of us who are paying attention, into a psychiatric emergency -- into trauma.

They dominate. They control. They terrorize.

They are abusers.

Which is no surprise if you understand where Obama comes from. He was not schooled in the Martin Luther King, Jr. tradition of unity and nonviolence, as most naive liberals thought.

Obama was educated in the Malcolm X way, the American political mafiosi: the Weatherman, Black Panthers, Black nationalists.

What were these groups&apos; lesson plans? &quot;Blue eyed devils,&quot; &quot;Jewish dogs,&quot; &quot;By any means necessary.&quot;

While the media and schools have whitewashed history, these groups were filled to the rafters with gangsters. Today&apos;s young radicals use sociopaths like Huey P. Newton as their role models, not the beneficent King.

So when Sarah Palin&apos;s life is threatened for speaking the truth, this is the work of thugs.

When Michael Savage is banned in Britain for passionately defending our country, this is persecution.

When citizens receive death threats for deigning to ask a question about health care, this is terror.

Some people think that Obama is just a harmless sheep in wolf&apos;s clothing because he doesn&apos;t raise his voice. If his underlings cause mayhem, well, that&apos;s not his fault.

But the best and the brightest of abusers never get their hands dirty.

Their work is done through a look, a blank stare, a grin, a devilish laugh. They can incite trouble without lifting a finger.

So if you feel uncomfortable, and tense, and scared, this is why. This is what abusers do.

They cause terror in us because of something old and something new. The old: memories get triggered of past trauma: our bad tempered parent, or abusive spouse, or bully boss.

The body remembers. Suddenly you are 6 or l3 or 30 again, and you may respond with the same helplessness and anger and panic.

But there&apos;s also new trauma, what&apos;s happening right underneath our noses; the never ending assaults on our freedom.

The daily force feeding of leftist ideology designed to control every aspect of our lives. The health care rationing that threatens our families. The strangling of business through Big Brother intrusions.

Joining with dictators; yawning when Iran and North Korea threaten; abandoning our allies. Indoctrinating our children and trying to turn them into the little Benedict Arnold&apos;s.

The trauma of Obama -- it&apos;s all around us, it may be in us if we&apos;re having symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (for instance, nightmares, intrusive images, numbing, physical symptoms, problems sleeping or eating).

But this isn&apos;t post traumatic, because there is no post here, and that keeps much of the nation in trauma/survival mode: fight, flight, freeze.

Fight: we&apos;re fighting back nonviolently through active participation;

Flight: we fantasize about fleeing;

Freeze: we can become frozen with fear, like a deer in the headlights.

Or a fourth reaction to danger, fawning: cow towing to Obama by doing his bidding. A Stockholm Syndrome, where the captive aligns with the abuser in hopes of winning favors.

There&apos;s a final &quot;F,&quot; the most formidable one, the one taking root and flourishing all across the country: it&apos;s faith. Faith in a Higher Power or ourselves or the American system or its people.

Ordinary citizens rising up, like a phoenix. This awakening might prove to be Obama&apos;s most enduring legacy.

The miracle of a soccer mom attending a protest for the very first time; an elderly man bravely stepping up to the mike at a Town Hall; strangers forming life long bonds at Tea Parties or online, at sites like American Thinker. People like me snapping out of the leftist trance.

In time, the Trauma of Obama may be overshadowed by the Mock of Barack: people speaking up, from Bozeman to Boise to Boston -- and refusing to become one of Obama&apos;s hench men or victims.

When I behold the courage and dignity of my fellow citizens, I recall a powerful Buddhist tale:

The cruelest, most violent Samurai in Japan decides he wants to become enlightened. He bursts into the home of an esteemed Zen Master and demands that the Master teach him how to become enlightened.

The Zen Master looks deeply into his eyes and says, &quot;No. You are a dirty, vicious Samurai. I will not teach you.&quot;

Enraged, the Samurai yanks out his sword and places it right at the Zen Master&apos;s neck. He hollers, &quot;Do you have any idea who I am? I am the cruelest Samurai in the world. I can cut your throat and not blink an eye.&quot;

Without skipping a beat, the Master calmly responds, &quot;Do you have any idea who I am? I can let you slit my throat and not blink an eye.&quot;

The Samurai falls to his knees, sobbing, overcome by the presence of a man mightier than his sword.

Those of us who are paying attention know the truth. With our eyes and hearts and minds wide open, we see them; we&apos;re on to them.

Emboldened by faith and righteous anger, we confront the Powers that Be.

Carrying our children&apos;s future; sheltered by the strong arms of our forbearers; awash with grace; we speak in one thunderous voice.

We say,

&quot;We know who you are.

&quot;Do you have any idea who we are?&quot;


(You may shoot me with your words,

You may cut me with your eyes,

You may kill me with your hatefulness,

But still, like air, I&apos;ll rise.)

(Maya Angelou)

       Prepare yourself for the loss of your freedom of speech. Unless you&apos;re a liberal Democrat, that is...

 Ministry of Truth, Obama-style 

By John Griffing

Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.
- George Orwell

President Obama has been agitating for the authority to criminalize political opponents since he took office. First there was the raft of DHS reports profiling conservatives as terrorists. Then came the push for a new fairness doctrine, subsequently refined to be achieved in diversity regulations to be imposed on local radio stations. Following these attacks on free speech was the much debated hate crimes legislation, considered by many to be a back-door path to silencing critics of the administration. But, while dangerous to free speech, none of these draconian policies could do as much damage as new regulatory czar Cass Sunstein&apos;s shocking proposal to ban &quot;falsehoods&quot; -- a term left up to the Obama administration to define. If Sunstein succeeds, free speech will be truly dead in America.

These revelations are found in Sunstein&apos;s new book, On Rumors: How Falsehoods Spread, Why We Believe Them, What Can Be Done, in which he attacks the plague of &quot;rumors&quot; besetting the Obama administration. Rumors must be regulated, according to Sunstein. Suspiciously, Sunstein&apos;s definition of &quot;rumors&quot; never seems to favor conservatives. To combat &quot;rumors,&quot; Sunstein proposes fines, and even obligatory retractions, in the case of Internet publications.[1]

In his new book, harsh penalties would be meted out for those that &quot;spread rumors about an appointee of a Democratic president,&quot; an occurrence likely to increase if Sunstein continues to assault the very foundations upon which America is built.[2] Sunstein will have to accuse millions of Americans of &quot;spreading rumors.&quot; Perhaps Sunstein even dreams of an eventual final solution for rumor perpetrators.

The flaw in Sunstein&apos;s logic should be obvious to even the mildly literate: libel and slander laws already exist to address Sunstein&apos;s alleged concerns. What Sunstein is after is not merely a redress of disinformation, or even the ability to dismiss critics as liars, but rather the actual power to threaten critics with the penalty of law. No due process need be given to those Sunstein accuses of lying. All that will be required is a &quot;notice to take down,&quot; in the case of the Internet. As Sunstein writes, &quot;Those who run websites would be obliged to take down falsehoods upon notice.&quot; But who determines falsehoods? Not a court of law, if Sunstein&apos;s proposal is enacted.

Sunstein, arguably the most powerful bureaucrat in America at present, will decide who is lying and who is telling the truth. At present, if someone lies, there is a sure remedy already in existence: Sunstein, President Obama, or any other official about which a deceptive statement is made, can provide information to contradict the claims of the &quot;liars.&quot; The only problem for Sunstein and Obama is the frequency with which accusers are telling the truth, and no contradictory information exists.

As it happens, the ability to contradict opponents is not a strong suit of the Obama administration. The President is consistently caught in a web of falsehoods on issues like healthcare, with no credible defense to offer. If only Sunstein could simply issue a &quot;notice to take down&quot; decree to all those pesky web journalists who don&apos;t get leg tingles when President Obama speaks, Obama&apos;s &quot;truth&quot; could proceed in a vacuum. But, for now at least, facts are still available for those who care to seek them.

In Sunstein&apos;s ideal new republic, though, any plan of the Obama administration would be unchallengeable. Inconvenient facts would be unreportable. Not even the infamous Sedition Acts approached the degree of disdain for the Constitution inherent in Sunstein&apos;s philosophy. Sunstein would scrap the First Amendment if it saved him political embarrassment. And Sunstein provides plenty to be embarrassed about, such as writing to endorse the use of cap and trade, to conceal redistributive justice, or saying that animals should have the same rights as human beings.

Bottom-line, freedom of the press is protected not only when it is helpful to the President. It is protected in all cases at all times. Apart from inciting violence or yelling &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, no precedent exists for the regulation of free speech. Our revered charter of liberty does not say that government can regulate free speech when it is politically expedient or deemed necessary by an animal-worshipping socialist posing as an environmentalist. The First Amendment to the US Constitution says that, &quot;Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; This staunch prohibition may be inconvenient in the extreme to the Obama administration, but anyone who plots to counteract this constitutional protection of liberty is, quite simply, a traitor and should be removed from public service.

The essence of America is freedom for all who seek it. This includes freedom of the press, freedom to speak the truth, freedom to criticize our leaders. If America becomes a land of &quot;freedom for some,&quot; it will cease to be America. There is no possible justification for the desecration of liberty, and if an ideology requires the desecration of liberty to succeed, it has no place in America. Freedom of speech, that precious gift men have died to protect, is rubbish to Sunstein, who considers the Constitution to be nothing more than a set of outmoded guidelines:

 A system of limitless individual choices, with respect to communications, is not necessarily in the interest of citizenship and self-government... Democratic efforts to reduce the resulting problems ought not be rejected in freedom&apos;s name. 

Sunstein adds that his proposal is &quot;almost certainly unconstitutional.&quot; It is curious that an effort to restrict the freedom of individual Americans to express ideas is &quot;democratic&quot; in Sunstein&apos;s lexicon.

Ideas are not criminal offenses in America. Beliefs are not censorable. Sunstein seeks to create an America where deviation from an arbitrarily ordained political orthodoxy becomes a punishable act. And this is not something to which Americans should ever consent. Sunstein should be removed from his position at once.

       The Self-Censorship of Liberals: It&apos;s Too Scary to Look 

When the BBC finally ‘fessed up last week to the Global Warming Fraud -- without admitting how much they aided and abetted the scam over ten years or more -- a liberal gent I know was shocked. He had sort of gritted his teeth and tolerated my skepticism over the years, but he never wanted to judge the whole fraudulent business for himself, although he had plenty of qualifications to do so. But this fraud was obvious. You had to want to close your eyes not to see it. I say that with all appreciation to the scientists and bloggers like Anthony Watt, who doggedly did the hard work of double-checking the fraud.

The global warming fraud is a lesson in the self-censorship of liberals, their fear of finding out the truth. It&apos;s even worse when you see that same self-inflicted blindness over and over again. Millions of liberals didn&apos;t want to know about Obama before the election. They sleepwalked into that voting booth, like an old Disney cartoon with Donald Duck holding his arms out in front and with his eyes firmly shut. But they do that a lot, just shutting out sizable parts of the world and not exercising basic adult intelligence in the minefield of politics. They are sucker-bait, user-car-salesman-bait, and I assume that somewhere in Nigeria a whole sweatshop of con artists with PCs is sending out thousands of emails to American liberals, and just raking in the dough. I mean, liberalism is a guarantee of gullibility, and how else do con artists earn a living? You gotta go where the suckers are. Maybe they just go for Sierra Club members, on the theory that people who are willing to believe in cute little polar bears that are desperately stuck on a melting ice floe will fall for anything.

If the Left had the simple integrity to open their minds they would have found out exactly what you and I knew a long time ago about Mr. Obama -- and the country would have averted a real risk of a catastrophe. It wasn&apos;t hard to find out. Even Obama Himself said he wasn&apos;t ready to run for Prez a couple of years ago. A lot of smart people did real journalism on Obama&apos;s background -- but none of them work in the media, of course.

Obama Himself is not to blame for his gargantuan ego. Chances are that he&apos;s been flattered outrageously by all his mentors from toddlerhood onward, most of them being whacky white liberals. That might be why he surrounds himself with all those Leftocrats: They are the best sources of ego fodder. They share his fantasy life, where he&apos;s always the Hero. He doesn&apos;t need any achievements. Obama is Nobel Prize material just by being Himself. By accepting the Big Prize without a blush he made his endless self-love obvious to the whole world. All the political jackals are laughing up their sleeves, because now they know the key to this White House. Watch ‘em operate on this guy in years to come.

This is not new. Courtiers used to surround little child princes and princesses with years of flattery, resulting in Roman Emperors like Caligula and Nero, and French Queens like Marie Antoinette and Dominique de Villepin. Human beings drift out of touch with reality when they are constantly poodle-licked with flattery. They become easy to manipulate, which is why all the cynical courtiers constantly polish the egos of their little princes. They still do.

Those five Norwegians on the Nobel PC committee acted perfectly in character. They wanted to shower love and glory on Our Guy, and by gum, they sure did, and made themselves look like priceless fools in the process. With any luck they may have destroyed whatever credibility the PC Prize had left, after Planet Gore flamed out. Obama&apos;s preemptive Nobel Prize made even the New York Times a tad defensive -- I&apos;ve never seen that happen in the whole Glorious Reign of Pinch.

It all goes back to psychological denial. In psychiatric lingo &quot;denial&quot; -- blocking out big chunks of reality -- is considered to be a &quot;regressive&quot; defense. People in denial are childlike, and have a hard time telling the difference between truth and lies, especially when the lies are delivered by a black man with an Obamanesque baritone. When adults in positions of power and responsibility regress so profoundly, this country is in real danger. And it all happened because millions of liberal voters were just not willing even to Google &quot;Obama.&quot; They took him at face value, and swooned. Nine months later some of them woke up. It&apos;s those voters who deserve the blame, and all the teachers and professors who taught them to be as blind as they are.

Now the Nobel PC Committee finally jumped the shark, and a real sense of shock seems to ripple through the Left. Even the pundits were baffled, and for once in their lives they didn&apos;t all say exactly the same thing in perfect harmony. They were shocked by a momentary bump into that ole&apos; brick wall of reality, but it will be a long time before they admit it. Remember how long it took for the Left to dump Bill Clinton? They needed a &quot;transitional object,&quot; in psychiatric lingo, a new comfort blanket -- Obama -- before they could junk their previous one. Bill Clinton with his voice cracking with maudlin emotion and saying &quot;I Caaayyyr For You&quot; was good enough to keep them hooked for a couple of presidential terms. But then he got white hair (for real, not a tint job) and they had to find another blankey. Obama is It. He&apos;s the One.

That&apos;s what you get when race, gender and LGBT status become your sole standards for judging people. Simple honesty, competence and integrity are left behind. It happens wherever PC is spoken. Obama wasn&apos;t the only fraud running on the Democrat side. John Edwards and Hillary couldn&apos;t stand the light of day either. Dennis Kucinich was the only one with integrity, and he was disqualified for other reasons.

I&apos;m sorry to say that millions of otherwise normal people, mostly on the Left, seem to be badly regressed. Don&apos;t ever let them cross the street without a trustworthy adult to hold their hand. Don&apos;t give ‘em a credit card, or too many lollypops, and for heaven&apos;s sake, don&apos;t ever let ‘em vote.

Who knows what might happen if they elect a nut job?

       Alinskyite in Chief Is a Master Polarizer 

By Kyle-Anne Shiver

The thirteenth rule of radical tactics: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.
- Saul Alinsky, the Father of Community Organizing
Rules for Radicals; p. 128

There&apos;s a whole lot of polarizing going on in Obama&apos;s America. Unity is out, apparently. Polarization is still in. And Rush Limbaugh and Fox News are the new Bush.

One would need to be a complete ninny outfitted with blinders and earplugs not to know this by now.

One blaring truth rears its ugly head to any open-minded person who takes a hard look at Barack Obama&apos;s personal and political history. His history is shot clear through with polarizing effects, both intentional and unintentional.

One might almost say that Barack Obama was a born polarizer.

Obama&apos;s Polarization Roots

When Barack Obama burst upon the national political stage with his speech to the 2004 Democratic National Convention, he was selling himself as an ideal-Republic American. Yes, as is typical of all of Obama&apos;s speeches, this one was heavy on the &quot;I.&quot; Nevertheless, the speech heard ‘round the world at that convention was one just about any American anywhere could like.

The most memorable lines and the ones that drew the heaviest applause:

Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.

Well, I say to them tonight, there&apos;s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there&apos;s the United States of America.

There&apos;s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there&apos;s the United States of America.

Unfortunately for the Country, these were indeed just words.

As researchers came to learn during the campaign, Barack Obama was raised on the mother&apos;s milk of socialism, not the bedrock American values claimed by the Axelrod-spun, fairytale narrative.

Both Barack&apos;s mother and his father were fellow travelers of the Marxist band and made no bones about this during their lives. Stanley Ann Dunham was spouting the &quot;gospel of envy&quot; by the time she was in her mid-teens. Barack Obama Sr. saw his own political career in Kenya die out, not only due to his alcoholism, but also due to his hard-core communist fealties, which were too stringent for the softer-core socialists in command of the fledgling post-colonial country of his birth. Young Barack&apos;s grandfather, who was his primary caregiver from age 10, made sure the youngster spent vast amounts of his free time with stalwart avowed communist, Frank Marshall Davis.

At their very core, all Marxist theories rest upon polarization, which is the direct result of envy and greed for power. &quot;They have what we want,&quot; is the rallying cry of all socialist/communist/fascist systems. All Marxist creeds are as naturally polarizing as a mob of looters.

Fancy, high-flying words don&apos;t change a thing.

When Barack Obama made his way to Chicago, he was already a natural polarizer, seeing the world through us-vs.-them lenses. His associations with ACORN (Project Vote) and Jeremiah Wright fit perfectly with the worldview his parents, grandfather and mentor purposefully taught him.

His study of Alinsky power tactics during those years merely reinforced that polarizing worldview and gave it stronger legs.

The church chosen by Barack Obama in Chicago was run by Jeremiah Wright, another active and vociferous polarizer. Wright based his own theology on the writings of James H. Cone, a man who boastfully declares that blacks -- not Jews -- are the chosen people of God, that they&apos;re due special preference because of their history of oppression and that the only way a white person can join them is to shed their &quot;white skins&quot; and become black in their souls. Both Cone and Wright preach black supremacy and black separatism and have bought hook, line and sinker the socialist, &quot;They have what we want,&quot; rallying cry. Barack Obama chose this theology of his own free will as a full-fledged, well-educated adult.

As a young politician in Chicago, Obama was known for sowing division and polarity among his own constituents, first with his underhanded treatment of Alice Palmer, then with his ill-fated challenge of Bobby Rush for the U.S. Congress.

Why would anyone believe that Barack Obama had a single unifying bone in his body? Such a belief defies common sense.

The Master Polarizer as President

President Barack Obama sailed into the presidency itself on the wings of eight years of solid, left-wing manipulated polarizing of all things Bush. So, why did Americans believe Obama would be anything but a polarizing president? David Mendell, writing in his book, From Promise to Power, puts his finger right on the pulse of Obama&apos;s ease with bamboozling all comers.

It&apos;s the smooth-flowing, used-car-salesman rhetoric, honey.

Writing of Obama&apos;s U.S. Senate campaign, Mendell noted (p. 248):

&quot;As he had so often before, Obama sold his message to both liberals and centrists, as well as to some who tilted toward the right. His message, after all, was both liberal and conservative. His policy positions were decidedly to the left, but he offered them in such a passive, two-pronged way that it made him sound almost conservative.&quot;

After becoming president, Obama&apos;s first target of Alinsky polarization tactics was Rush Limbaugh. The targeting began very early with Obama&apos;s words to Republican lawmakers over the hastily passed, non-bipartisan Stimulus package. When Republican lawmakers attempted to take the new President at his conciliatory campaign rhetoric and provide actual input, the President&apos;s petulant reply: &quot;I won.&quot; To which he added the polarizing bait: &quot;You can&apos;t just listen to Rush Limbaugh and expect to get anything done.&quot;

Obama, the general threw down the rhetorical gauntlet and ever since, his troops have followed suit, attempting to polarize Rush Limbaugh (and every one of Rush&apos;s listeners) in the same way Democrats effectively polarized President Bush.

President Obama followed up on his polarizing tactic against Rush Limbaugh at the White House Correspondents Dinner, laughing uproariously as Wanda Sykes plied her death-wish humor at Rush&apos;s kidneys and ludicrously suggested that Rush was the 20th hijacker on 9/11.

According to the Huffington Post, &quot;The White House&apos;s communications staff announced this week (referring to Oct 5-9) that it was charting out a new, more aggressive strategy, defined largely by a pledge to push back hard against news stories that are either inaccurate or unflattering.&quot; Anita Dunn appeared the following Sunday on CNN to fire the first salvo of this stated policy.

Since then, our Alinskyite in Chief has taken the unprecedented extra step of using the people&apos;s government to perform a rhetorical hit job on an independent media outlet, Fox News. Anita Dunn, White House Communications Director, whose favorite philosopher is Mao, the Chinese-Communist butcher, audaciously targeted Fox News on national television. She slandered the channel&apos;s coverage of the presidential campaign, declared it a &quot;wing of the Republican Party,&quot; and openly admitted the reason it was dissed by the President last month was its tenacious insistence on reporting stories unflattering to Obama.

This open polarizing of independent news and opinion broadcasters is not by accident, but by design and rests solidly at the feet of the President. Dunn made it big in the news again this week for her declarations that Obama had controlled the media during the campaign. But this control of the media thing only works if one controls all the media.

The Goals of Alinskyite Polarization: Killing the Opposition

Saul Alinsky declared that the only way to effect any substantial change in the prevailing order of power (Haves vs. Have-nots) was to first polarize the whole societal/political atmosphere.

Alinsky described his community organizer as someone who must become a &quot;well-integrated political schizoid.&quot;

&quot;The organizer must become schizoid, politically, in order to slip into becoming a true believer. Before men can act an issue must be polarized. Men will act when they are convinced their cause is 100 percent on the side of the angels and that the opposition are 100 percent on the side of the devil. He knows there can be no action until issues are polarized to this degree.&quot; (Rules for Radicals; p. 78)

When Senate candidate Obama gave that speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 and declared, &quot;even as we speak, there are those preparing to divide us,&quot; he was talking out both sides of his mouth.

Being a consummate divider is the community organizer&apos;s very job description. His task is to &quot;rub raw the sores of discontent&quot; until ordinary people become so agitated with the status quo that they are willing to do whatever is necessary to change it. When Alinsky was taunted with the accusation that organizers were nothing but &quot;professional agitators,&quot; he gleefully agreed, declaring that the organizer&apos;s job was to &quot;fan the flames of discontent.&quot; Only hopelessness and overwhelming fear of the future, he contended, that would pave the way for revolution:

Dostoevsky said that taking a new step is what people fear most. Any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive, affirmative, non-challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people. They must feel so frustrated, so defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and chance the future. - Rules for Radicals, p. xix

That&apos;s precisely where we were in the lead-up to the presidential election. Americans were indeed &quot;rubbed raw&quot; from the left&apos;s ceaseless caterwauling against Bush, the &quot;religious right,&quot; &quot;ideological&quot; policy making, &quot;Bush&apos;s war,&quot; etc. And it has been clear from the beginning of the Obama presidency that he and his supporters believed enacting far-reaching leftist policies would be little more than child&apos;s-play. After all, the President also had overwhelming majorities in Congress to do his bidding.

But things have not gone as easily or as uncritically as hoped. Resistance has formed and it has been widespread and quite resilient against the President&apos;s charms. Rather than re-examine his policy proposals or question himself, President Obama simply goes to the fallback position of every true-blue Alinskyite. He &quot;picks a target, freezes it, personalizes it and polarizes it.&quot;

In the President&apos;s mind, the only reason good Americans disagree with him and his far-reaching, anti-American policies are those media folks who report on his scheming, i.e., Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. The other news and opinion outlets have given the Alinskyite a complete pass.

Alinsky taught that the purpose of polarization was not only to &quot;rub raw the sores of discontent,&quot; but also to force the target into committing the &quot;crimes&quot; of which he stood preemptively accused. Alinsky gave examples of how he had polarized and tormented an opponent so forcefully and tenaciously that the target eventually broke and succumbed to things like breaking into his offices to get information and hurling invective that made him look guilty to onlookers. The whole idea of polarization is to push the target into becoming the villain he was targeted to be.

Alinsky summed up his polarization tactic with these tidbits, which should act as warnings to targets of Alinskyite polarization:

The real action is in the enemy&apos;s reaction.
The enemy properly goaded and guided in his reaction will be your major strength.

To those who would decry his tactics as unwholesome and at bedrock, untruthful, Alinsky offered this rebuttal:

&quot;Can you imagine in the arena of conflict charging that so-and-so is a racist bastard and then diluting the impact of the attack with qualifying remarks such as, ‘He is a good churchgoing man, generous to charity, and a good husband&apos;? This becomes political idiocy.&quot; (Rules for Radicals; p. 134)

Even though Alinsky dedicated his book, Rules for Radicals, to the one he referred to as the &quot;very first radical known to man,&quot; none other than Lucifer, Alinsky was also quite adroit at claiming he was following injunctions by Jesus Christ, too.

&quot;The classic statement on polarization comes from Christ: ‘He that is not with me is against me.&apos; (Luke 11:23) He allowed no middle ground to the moneychangers in the Temple. One acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other.&quot; (Rules for Radicals; p. 134)

Putting himself on the same level as Christ was an Alinsky favorite and it certainly reminds me of our own Alinskyite in Chief.

President Obama has sown division among religious people too. Among Jews, he has polarized stalwart supporters of Israel and in his foreign policy moves against the tiny State, has relied on backing of anti-Israel Jewish groups, such as J-Street. President Obama has also attempted to polarize the Pope and stirred division among Catholics by speaking at Notre Dame. In religion, as well as politics, President Obama adopts the all-with-me or against-me rhetoric, but unlike God, is willing to use any dirty trick in the book to get his way.

Seems like the actions of a true radical in the Luciferian mold to me.

The bottom line on polarization is that it&apos;s an ugly, deceitful power tactic being used unabashedly by President Barack Obama to further his own designs for America. But targeting the most popular, successful radio and television personalities in America today would seem a bit beyond the pale, even for an Alinskyite in Chief.

President Obama should, perhaps, have heeded Alinsky&apos;s warnings on picking perfect targets:

&quot;It should be borne in mind that the target is always trying to shift responsibility to get out of being the target. There is a constant squirming and moving and strategy...on the part of the designated target. The forces for change must keep this in mind and pin that target down securely. If an organization permits responsibility to be diffused and distributed in a number of areas, attack becomes impossible.&quot;

With 15-20 million listeners every week and plenty of financial power, Rush Limbaugh has proven that he is not a soft target. Remember the left&apos;s Congressional-letter fiasco. As the most highly viewed Cable news network, Fox would seem also un-amenable to easy polarizing. Eventually, other news individuals and organizations will most likely enter this president-picked fight on the side of their beleaguered Fox comrades, not to mention the millions of Fox&apos;s angered viewers.

Backlash is forming faster than a thunder cloud on a hot summer day. It&apos;s going to be a fine fight and I&apos;m bidding for the popcorn concession.

       Silence of the Lambs 

By Robin of Berkeley

Growing up, I was expected to be quiet. Silence is necessary to maintain secrets.

Parents drinking? Keep your mouth shut. White kids targeted at school?

Don&apos;t tell or you&apos;ll be sorry.

When you have no words to describe your world and no one wants to hear about it anyway, a part of you goes mute. But this doesn&apos;t mean you stop observing and sensing.

When my mother flew into rages, I knew something was wrong. When my parents were rarely home, I sensed that this wasn&apos;t normal.

Being robbed of language is a state of isolation, of suspended animation. It&apos;s like that bad dream where you try to scream but can&apos;t. It&apos;s the ultimate disempowerment.

Recently I wrote a couple of articles for American Thinker which included strong words like evil and trauma.

Another AT writer creamed me for using extreme language. I understand her concern about conservatives sounding irrational.

At the same time, someone needs to holler, &quot;The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!&quot; when they&apos;re in your line of vision.

Uttering words is risky. They can backfire, get you in trouble. They can make you look foolish.

But there is more of a risk, I think, in stifling yourself. Words have the power to wake people up. Silence can lull them to sleep.

Silence legitimizes abnormal behavior, makes it appear normal and acceptable. People become desensitized, numb.

First there&apos;s one advisor to Obama linked to Communism. The MSM doesn&apos;t say a word. Then there are three or five or ten or God knows how many.

If The New Black Panthers bring billy clubs to polling sites and get away with it, that&apos;s the new normal. The next thing we know, a union thug bites off a finger at a Town Hall.

If Hillary and Sarah are vilified and enough people don&apos;t speak out, then everyone, from Rush to us, becomes fair game.

One of the reasons I became a psychotherapist is because I know the damage done to a person when he&apos;s robbed of words.

And I know how people can reawaken when they discover their voices.

When a woman can finally speak of a rape, or a man of his grief, life unfreezes; it becomes fluid and alive. There&apos;s power in reciting our stories.

Another reason I was drawn to therapy: because I&apos;ve lived my life as a Paul Revere type. I try to warn people, guard them, to do for others what wasn&apos;t done for me.

The problem is that people can kill the messenger. I&apos;ve had to deal with a fair amount of judgment and scorn.

For instance, a friend called me &quot;mean,&quot; when I said that her new brother-in-law was bad news. But that same friend came to me in tears when the man targeted her.

I am not always right; I&apos;m not psychic. I just pay close attention, and report what I see.

And this is what I see: the Progressives Are Coming, the Progressives Are Coming.

You may be just learning about progressivism. Even the astute Glenn Beck admitted he knew nothing a year ago about the progressive left. What he&apos;s found out has chilled him to the bone.

Up until early last year, I was a progressive. There are no liberals in Berkeley.

We might arrive here a liberal, but after steeping in leftism, we either leave or buy into the program.

Progressivism is not just a political persuasion. It is a cult, with deep roots in violent movements: Communism, the Black Panthers, the Symbionese Liberation Army, the Weatherman.

These groups had an artillery of weapons. Their enemy, within: capitalism, white imperialism.

Take Van Jones, for instance. He was jailed for his participation in the Rodney King riots; believed 9/11 was an inside job; and wanted to use his Green Czar gig for revolution. Jones calls himself a Communist, and won&apos;t use the &quot;American&quot; in &quot;African American.&quot;

Part of the extreme fringe of progressivism? Progressivism is an extreme fringe.

Liberals want a kinder, gentler version of the American Dream. Leftists want to slash and burn it.

Leftists are liberals on steroids.

This is why many progressives will sacrifice their children to unsafe schools even if their kid gets a black eye. And why they&apos;ll support policies to let their granny die.

This is why they allow the streets of Berkeley and San Francisco to become a filthy netherworld where law abiding citizens are preyed upon, including themselves.

Because comrades-in-arms must make sacrifices for the cause.

Most progressives are sheep-like, and just follow the leader. But many of the leaders are certifiable crazies. Mad Men.

Or sane, but noxious human beings. They shed tears about an endangered snail while treating people like crap.

Here are some recent sightings of Berkeley bumper stickers: &quot;I&apos;d Rather Be Smashing Imperialism,&quot; &quot;U.S. Out of Israel,&quot; &quot;Free Palestine.&quot; And this brand new chilling one: &quot;Under New Management&quot; (With a blood red image of the United States).

Just crazy, leftist Berkeley, right? Yes -- up until 8 months ago.

So, when are we allowed to speak out loud?

How many radicals must preach to Obama, write books for him, advise him; how many brother to brother handshakes and hugs and bows must we witness before we get to ask: Is Obama one of us or one of them?

How many thugs need to rule at Town Halls; how many churches torched and fingers maimed; how many Talk Radio hosts demonized; before we can state the obvious: these people are soulless.

Call me names: Hysterical. Paranoid. A Fear monger. Racist. It doesn&apos;t really matter.

Because truth is not our own. It doesn&apos;t belong to any of us. It doesn&apos;t change with the political wind.

Truth is not here one day and gone the next. It will survive when we are long gone.

We speak, not for ourselves, but to strengthen and carry each other.

We speak for the children, born or still a dream.

We speak in a roar or a whisper; to the world or just to ourselves.

Because we have to. Because what the Left fears the most is the truth. Like a vampire, their downfall is the Light of day.

In Obama&apos;s America, speaking the truth is a revolutionary act. It is our greatest weapon, more powerful than an arsenal.

Because truth is like a genie. Once released from the bottle, it takes on a life of its own. And it gathers force and strength and ferocity until it changes everything and everyone that it touches.

&quot;If you asked me what I came in this world to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud.&quot;-Emile Zola

       Why White America Chose Obama 

By Robin of Berkeley

I grew up in a small city in the New York suburbs. My parents scrimped and saved to give us a saner life than in the Bronx.

Unlike most other towns in the county, our area was diverse, with a wealthy population in opulent estates; a middle class group (mine); and a large, low income population, mostly comprised of black residents.

In the 60&apos;s, liberal policy makers conceived of forced busing so that deprived kids could enjoy tonier surroundings. The utopians envisioned the dazzling spectacle of ethnic bonding.

At my elementary school, the black kids arrived each day by bus while whites walked or rode bikes. When the kids exited the bus, they looked scared to death, dazed into silence. Walking into school together must have felt like a walk of shame.

Notwithstanding the Kumbaya vision of the races mixing and matching, we each stayed in our racial groups. The only girl I remember is Sheila Smith, the lone black girl in my class. She wore crisply ironed dresses, her wavy hair adorned with pretty bows and clips.

I was a sensitive and observant child. I recall gazing into Sheila&apos;s eyes and witnessing a fright I&apos;d never witnessed before. Sitting in the back of the class, Sheila was mute the entire year.

Several elementary schools converged together in middle school. That&apos;s when all hell broke loose. Reunited, hordes of black kids charged defiantly down the hallways, mowing down anyone who got in their way.

They had suffered horribly through those lonely, humiliating, seven years. And now it was time for revenge.

Sheila Smith let her hair thicken into a wild afro and became one of the meanest girls. I averted my eyes when I saw her because her furious visage frightened me.

Middle school was like living in a war zone. The white kids were called every name in the book. There were few of us who weren&apos;t assaulted, knifed, robbed, molested on a regular basis. I developed physical problems for fear of using the bathroom, where many of the attacks happened.

In retrospect I wish I had told an adult -- my parents or someone at school. But when you&apos;re a small child in a Sarajevo-like environment, you keep your head down and your mouth shut.

It&apos;s unlikely, anyway, that the adults would have acted. My parents were preoccupied with their busy social life.

Plus, these were the days before private schools proliferated, and my Jewish parents weren&apos;t about to send me to the local Catholic school. I imagine my teachers were as petrified as we were, just trying to get through the day in one piece.

After middle school, all the teens in our city merged into the one, mammoth high school, which became a veritable madhouse. Luckily by then I was so zoned out on pot and pills that I was less aware of the anarchy.

I did know to never, ever go to school on the last day of classes since this was when the white kids were beaten up and thrown in the small ponds encircling school grounds.

In my six years of middle and high schools, I never once attended a club, a dance, a meeting, or any other after school activity. My best friend Jean and I would hightail it out of there as soon as the last bell rang.

You might think my school experience is unusual. Sadly, it&apos;s not. Innumerable people attended schools that were racial minefields.

It wasn&apos;t the black or the white kids&apos; fault. High minded liberals were culpable for hatching up grand plans without an iota of thought about how it would play out in real time: that if you create a nightmare situation for black children by removing them from their neighborhood and their friends, you traumatize them. And if you then turn them loose and give them carte blanche, some will be out for blood.

Forced busing ended years ago in most places. But over the decades, liberals have concocted new plans, and subjected later generations to fresh trauma.

Meet Julie, age 24, a survivor of public schools in Boston. She now has such severe anxiety that she cuts her arms to relieve the tension.

What did she learn at school? Blame Whitey.

Every day she was shoved and cursed at and threatened. She knew that if she complained, she&apos;d be labeled a racist. Then she&apos;d be like raw meat to vultures.

The lack of any voice, any way of defending herself, damaged her as much as the punches. Now, she continually puts herself in harm&apos;s way by being unable to say no.

Or take Joe, a local boy, now 20 and struggling to get through college, given his psychological problems and learning gaps. He attended one of our many leftist indoctrination camps (i.e., Bay Area urban public schools).

Being one of the few white kids, Joe had two choices: keeping his nose to the grindstone and being jumped every other day; or joining a gang, which is what he did.

But being from a moral, caring family, Joe is now wracked with guilt about what he did -- burglaries, robberies, slashing tires, hurting innocent people. He also has post traumatic stress disorder after two of his friends were killed for wearing the wrong color.

I could go on and on. I could tell you about Rose, a 24 year old survivor of local public schools, who can read Ebonics but not Shakespeare. She told me about Slave Days, where the white kids played the slaves and the blacks the masters.

And it&apos;s not just the white kids who can be terrorized. Studious kids of color are often threatened and jumped if they won&apos;t join in on the barbarity.

Given the brainwashing of several generations, did millions of whites vote for Obama out of white guilt? Yes, but it runs deeper than this.

What&apos;s happening is not just white guilt, but white shame. Shame is a much more devastating emotion.

We feel guilty about an action, for instance, cheating on taxes or spouses. Shame makes us feel bad about who we are, as though something is wrong with us.

To understand how people can shame each other, I want to introduce you to a defense mechanism, called projective identification. PI is different than projection, and it tends to be utilized by the more troubled among us. When someone feels crappy about themselves, they transmit it to someone else.

PI is like a hot potato. The other person takes their bad feelings and dumps it directly on your lap. They walk away free and easy, while you feel crummy.

That is what happened with Julie, Joe, and Rose. They were dumped on so often by so many that they absorbed the shame and started detesting themselves.

Interestingly, Obama, in one of his autobiographies, reports being intrigued by Malcolm X&apos;s statement that, as a biracial man, he despised his whiteness; that he wished there was some way that he could excise his white blood.

Now we have millions of whites who are ashamed of their white blood. Coincidence?

Along with white guilt and shame, there&apos;s another reason why whites flocked to a leader with no experience in leading: white fear. While many liberals reside in safe towns, still there&apos;s always a threat.

Turn on the 6 o&apos;clock news and hear about the latest cop murder or mob rampage. Rodney King riots in LA, the mayhem in Oakland, murdered police officers. Then listen to reportage that blames the victims.

Thuggery is celebrated. Bad guys are hecka cool; the innocents stupid and naive. Write a rap song about beating up a whore and killing a cop, and win a Grammy.

Think I&apos;m exaggerating? If there isn&apos;t an atmosphere of racial fear, why did people threaten a race war if Obama lost? Why are dissenters tarred with the vile label of racist? (Translation: pure evil)

Many liberals voted for Obama in the hopes that all would be forgiven. That if whites handed over some power, finally we can move on and get along. We&apos;ll be safe.

Had someone like General Colin Powell or former Congressman Harold Ford Jr. been elected, we probably would not have a foreboding, fearful atmosphere. Though they lean left, both men are patriotic, experienced leaders who may have facilitated racial healing.

Ironically, White America envisioned forgiveness, a letting go of old wounds. Instead we have emboldened people obsessed with evil deeds carried out by citizens long dead.
And not only whites are affected by the hostile environment. The vast majority of Blacks are law abiding citizens, and they are preyed upon in disproportionate numbers.

Philosopher Ayn Rand warned us decades ago of the dangers we were in for by playing racial politics. Her words from 40 years ago sound prophetic:

Whenever a country&apos;s criminal laws are more lenient than its civil laws, it means the country is accepting the basic principle of statism and is moving toward totalitarianism. . .What about the rights and liberties of the honest, the educated, the self-supporting, the majority? . . .

The altruists are now. . . struggling to induce racial guilt -- by proclaiming that people must suffer and pay for the (alleged) sins of their father.

There is no such thing as collective guilt. . This country has no guilt to atone for in regard to its black citizens. Slavery was an enormous evil. But a country that fought a civil war to abolish slavery has atoned for it.

How can an individual be held responsible for the views of others, whom he has no power to control? What can make him responsible for them? The answer we hear is: The fact that his skin is of the same color as theirs.

If this is not an obliteration of morality, of intellectual integrity, of individual rights, of the freedom of man&apos;s mind, of the First Amendment, you take it from here; I can&apos;t -- it turns my stomach.&quot;

Yes it&apos;s stomach turning to pit racial and ethnic groups against each other; to make children hate themselves; to disregard people&apos;s character and behavior.

Black is beautiful. But so is white, and brown, and yellow, and every color under the rainbow because we are all part of the Divine; we are vibrant threads in a larger tapestry.

I asked Rose what she would like people to know about her school experience. An exceptionally bright and kind young woman, she struggles to overcome the legacy of l3 years in urban public schools.

Her poignant words remind us that children should never be used as political footballs or for experiments in social engineering.

This is what she said:

&quot;I learned early on that white people were bad. Since I&apos;m white, I&apos;ve always hated myself. I was told from grade school on how bad white people were; how we scalped Indians and whipped slaves. I always thought black people were better than me. It&apos;s no wonder -- I was told this in one form or another every day.

I was made fun of at school and threatened and pushed around, but I never spoke up. I thought it was my fault, my punishment for being white.

Raising kids this way is wrong. It&apos;s wrong to teach white children to hate themselves. It&apos;s wrong to teach any child to hate herself. No one should have to put up with abuse because of the color of his or her skin.

It shouldn&apos;t have happened.&quot;

No, Rose, it shouldn&apos;t have.

       The End Game of the Left 

Tax the rich,
Feed the poor,
‘Til there are no
Rich no more.

- &quot;I&apos;d Love to Change the World&quot;
Ten Years After (1971)

Over the Columbus Day weekend, my wife and I traveled to Brooklyn, N.Y. to visit our daughter and her boyfriend. I was strictly admonished by my wife not to talk politics during the visit, since my daughter&apos;s boyfriend is a radical leftist. He, being a well-educated social science buff, and I, being who I am (a well-educated &quot;right-wing nut job&quot;), we had created many spectacular fireworks during past political debate sessions.

Things went well up until Sunday afternoon, when we were both seated on the couch benignly watching a football game on his 60&quot; television screen. During a commercial break, there was a news announcement concerning another New York City tax increase. Before I could catch myself, I blurted out the Ten Years After lyric at the top of this article.

It was as though I had hit his &quot;ON&quot; button. He immediately jumped off the couch and started screaming, &quot;That&apos;s RIGHT! That&apos;s EXACTLY RIGHT!&quot;

I replied, &quot;But shouldn&apos;t the lyric be &quot;Til there are no poor no more&apos;? Isn&apos;t that true social justice?&quot;

He stated with utmost certainty (from his standpoint, no rational debate was possible) that the wealthy in this country are wholly responsible for the world&apos;s misery and must be utterly destroyed by the most horrible means possible.

&quot;Then you want everyone to live in poverty?&quot; I queried.

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; he replied.

Sometimes I think I have heard it all, but this left me stunned. Before we could go on, my wife and daughter swooped in and broke up the mêlée.

But the incident left me with the thought that perhaps his viewpoint is not unique. Is a blind hatred of the &quot;rich&quot; driving much of the left&apos;s apparently self-destructive behavior? In a previous AT article, I concluded that the goals of the left are &quot;abortion and eugenic elimination of the ‘undesirables&apos;, the euthanasia of the old and infirm, and the genocide of those who disagree.&quot; But what was missing from this evaluation is the ultimate motivation for these travesties. Is it all driven by obsessive rage and hate?

I don&apos;t think it is quite that simple. There appears to be an abundance of negative emotion in the leftist mind, but that is only part of the equation. Almost everyone, including the leftist, believes that they are basically good and decent human beings. This is true among the religious and atheists, and even thieves and murderers. I believe that in order to emotionally reconcile inherently &quot;evil&quot; feelings of hatred toward others, the leftist embraces &quot;social justice&quot; as a pious compensation.

The original concept of social justice was envisioned as a virtuous governmental function, protecting the downtrodden and disadvantaged from a heartless society. As a form of coerced charity through taxation, the government decides what is just and provides for the &quot;common welfare.&quot;

In Friedrich August Hayek&apos;s book, Law, Legislation, and Liberty: The Mirage of Social Justice, he states:

It is one of the axioms of the tradition of freedom that coercion of individuals is permissible only where it is necessary in the service of the general welfare or the public good. Yet...the vagueness of the different terms which have been employed has made it possible to declare almost any interest a general interest and to make large numbers serve purposes in which they are not in the least interested. The common welfare or the public good has to the present time remained a concept most recalcitrant to any precise definition and therefore capable of being given almost any content suggested by interests of the ruling group.

As a result of this vagueness of definition, the foundation of hatred within the leftist mind has perverted the original intent of social justice. Babies must be aborted, grandma must be killed, and the infirm must be euthanized, all for the &quot;common welfare.&quot; How does this reconcile with the concept of using the wealth of society to champion the poor and helpless? &quot;Justice&quot; is no longer part of the equation. It has devolved into social engineering and tinkering without a heart and soul. Through the twisted filter of hatred, social justice has become a force for evil.

So why do the wealthy and powerful on the left (the &quot;poweratti&quot;) embrace this philosophy? Because they believe they will not be touched by it personally, and they can use it to garner additional political and/or social power. Taking the health care issue as an example, those currently in Congress have chosen to follow the refrain, &quot;Government-run health care for thee, but not for me&quot;. Other wealthy and politically-connected poweratti obviously believe they will be able to obtain quality health care from other sources, either overseas or in a domestic black market of private physicians and hospitals exclusively for the wealthy.

By enflaming hatred of the wealthy (and by extension, capitalism), the poweratti can brandish social justice as a weapon to seize complete control of government and essentially enslave the populace. How ironic that this hatred should result in extending their power and privilege!

In the leftist utopia of social justice, wealth is no longer created. The capitalist goose that laid the golden eggs is spread like pâté. Income and property are confiscated, housing and employment are assigned, as in Cuba and Venezuela. Scientific advancement and medical breakthroughs are ground to a halt, as in the old Soviet Union where technology was frozen in the 1950s. Entrepreneurship, personal advancement, and wealth creation are violently quashed, as in the Chinese Cultural Revolution under Mao Tse Tung. Hunger, disease, and death become familiar houseguests, as in all repressive regimes.

The end game of the leftist poweratti is to rule the nation and eventually the world by bringing us down to the lowest social common denominator through the manipulation of those who obsessively despise wealth.

       Klein: Fox&apos;s &apos;hateful crap&apos; borders on &apos;sedition&apos; 

George Joyce

For a fascinating glimpse into the seething and completely unhinged liberal mind check out Joe Klein’s dark and disturbing rant over at Time Magazine. The first line of the piece reads:

Let me be precise here: Fox News peddles a fair amount of hateful crap. Some of it borders on sedition. Much of it is flat out untrue.

Although Klein’s vitriol is off the charts it pales in comparison to what can only be described as his unseemly boot licking. Here’s an example:

If the problem is that stories bloated far beyond their actual importance -- ACORN&apos;s corruption, Van Jones&apos;s radical past -- are in danger of leaching out of the Fox hothouse into the general media, then perhaps the Administration should be a bit more diligent about whom it hires and whom it funds.

When a writer worries about stories “in danger of leaching out” he or she can best be described as a storm trooper, not a journalist. Just what is Klein trying to say here? Is he saying that snakes that are more capable of shrouding their identity from Fox News are a better bet for the Administration?

The philosopher Eric Hoffer once said the “missionary zeal seems rather an expression of some deep misgiving, some pressing feeling of insufficiency at the center.”

In other words, watch for these juvenile, Klein-like tantrums to only get worse on the left.

       Liberal AND eco-stupidity

 California May Ban TVs that Draw Too Much Power 

California residents are widely regarded as some of the most eco-friendly citizens in the nation. Now state lawmakers aim to make local consumer electronics extra green as well. A rule before the California Energy Commission would impose the nation’s first energy-efficiency requirements for flat-screen TVs, a mandatory standard that is expected to be copied by other states.

“The goal here is a simple one,” Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told commissioners at a hearing Tuesday. “We want to ensure that every TV sold in California is an efficient one.”

While there has been tremendous effort among consumer electronics and PC manufacturers to eliminate hazardous toxics and to reduce the overall power consumption of our gadgets and devices, progress comes in dribs and drabs without official oversight, some argue.

To that end, a vote on the standard could come as early as next month.

Some manufacturers argue a mandatory power standard would hamper innovation, limit consumer choice and hurt California electronics retailers. For example, the LA Times spoke with Doug Johnson, the Consumer Electronics Association’s senior director for technology policy. He argued that “voluntary efforts are succeeding without regulations,” warning that too much government interference could hamstring industry innovation and prove expensive to manufacturers and consumers.

At January’s consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, I noticed that pretty much every manufacturer of televisions was already touting innovations to reduce power consumption. But did that message get through to consumers? When you bought your new high-definition flat screen TV, did energy consumption factor into the decision?

       Are the Democrats Really This Desperate? 

By Steve Hines

For as long as they&apos;ve existed, politicians have bent language to avoid saying things that sound unpleasant. Once upon a time, the players in the major league of Washington, D.C. politics at least told their versions of truth with eloquence and style. My, how things have changed!

With countless examples of the media ignoring news that might damage Democrats, it seems this practice has bred a sense of security among the party&apos;s leaders. They even appear emboldened by their media allies as they get closer than ever to something they&apos;ve craved for decades: complete control of the health care industry. To wit, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her band of Pelosheviks are compelled to tell us that things are not what we know they are. Last week, Pelosi said with a straight face (I&apos;ve been waiting to use that line) that the expiration of the Bush tax cuts next year will not be a tax increase, but rather the &quot;eliminating a tax decrease that was there.&quot; This would be funny stuff if she were not in charge of our nation&apos;s fiscal health. Don&apos;t hold your breath waiting for that kind of health reform.

Galling disrespect for the electorate is the only explanation for the absurd twists of facts and phrases coming from the Democrats. While that does not surprise those of us who have watched them closely for years, others can now see their antics in the raw. For example, we are treated to a budget-busting &quot;stimulus&quot; that the White House admitted has stimulated just about all it can. Likewise, we get a defense funding bill that includes anti-gay hate crimes legislation buried deep within it. With Republicans in Washington now irrelevant even to their constituents (Senator Lindsay Graham [R-S.C.] doesn&apos;t even know where the health care bills are being written), cries of GOP obstructionism sound cynical even to the politically clueless. Lacking a credible bogeyman to blame for the ugly legislative process and its unpopular consequences, however, the Democrats do not even pretend to talk frankly about their plans to control one sixth of the economy.

With unquenchable avarice for control over every health care decision in America, Democrats have ramped up their assault on transparency by writing the health care bill in total secrecy. They have used accounting ploys to camouflage Medicare payments to doctors in return for support of health care reform. As if nobody knew the history of fraud and waste in other entitlement programs, they insist that healthcare reform will not cost $2 trillion, but only $847 billion. Instead of acknowledging obvious funding problems in existing federal healthcare programs, we get the likes of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) telling Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett that Medicare is not headed toward insolvency, at least not before she turns eighty. I wonder what Ms. Wasserman Schultz would say about my own state of Tennessee&apos;s near-bankruptcy from its attempt at universal healthcare coverage known as TennCare. And of course, we recently saw the stammering, stuttering Nancy Pelosi suddenly changing the name of a public option to a &quot;consumer option&quot; or &quot;competitive option&quot; or whatever they may call it tomorrow.

Not to be upstaged in the realm of the absurd, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) this week broke from his own party, at least publicly, with a proposal allowing states to &quot;opt into&quot; a public option, but that was before he floated the trial balloon that the bill would allow states to &quot;opt out&quot; of the plan. Of course, no state would be allowed to &quot;opt out&quot; of the taxes, excuse me, fees imposed on everyone to pay for their healthcare reform. Is there something about the letters O, P, and T that brings smiles to the faces of Democrat focus groups? By now everyone knows of the rumored procedural vote that will allow certain &quot;blue dog&quot; Democrat senators to vote for healthcare reform before they vote against it. No doubt that would make John Kerry proud.

So is this the change you voted for America, a party of amateur David Copperfields with complete disregard for their audience? Yes, we are watching one of the worst shows of hocus-pocus this side of a travelling carnival, courtesy of the Democrats. We can even see the trapdoor in the back of the disappearing booth, but we cannot get to an exit.

Clumsy and shameless Democrat legerdemain is the political equivalent of someone saying, &quot;Hey, look over there!&quot; before swiping the sandwich away from his friend. Their trickery is immediately obvious, but they do not care how it looks. With help from their lackeys in the media, Democrats believe they can repair their image before the next midterm elections, at least enough to avoid a Republican rout. That explains their rush to pass the healthcare bill as soon as possible. They may even hope to benefit from the confusing messages and rumors aided by conferencing in locked rooms. As long as polls tell them that Americans prefer Democrats to Republicans, they may be right: &quot;Hey, we&apos;re all rascals, but there are bad ones (Republicans) and less bad ones (Democrats). At least we&apos;re compassionate.&quot; Moreover, the confusion helps take the public&apos;s attention away from the serious rifts in their own party over the public option talisman.

Has America grown tired of the Democrats&apos; utter disrespect for the electorate? Whatever the outcomes of gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey next week, we will know the answer with certainty in about a year. Democrats in Congress might think they will not suffer dire consequences for their recent shenanigans. Or maybe they know they will, and that is the cause of their desperate rush to pass healthcare reform regardless of how bad it makes them look.

       The Pillars of Liberal Progressivism 

By Pete Morin


The United States of America rests at a crossroads today that is every bit as dire as what Americans faced during the Second World War. In fact, it may be even more so.

Liberal Progressives have fashioned so strong a hold on the American political landscape that to escape their clutches may no longer be possible for most citizens. What I call the &apos;Pillars of Liberal Progressivism&apos; have infected America with a virus so deadly that fighting it has become extremely difficult.

What are these pillars that progressives have worked so hard to erect in order to infiltrate and control?

1) University Academia: No institution was more instrumental than the university in shaping the minds and behavior of the young. Students schooled in the writings of radical revolutionaries such as Mao, Lenin, Trotsky -- and lesser-known malcontents like Alinsky, Zinn, and Chomsky -- spread their noxious fumes throughout the halls of academia. The &apos;true believer&apos; filled his pliant mind with the writings of these disaffected statists. The earlier attempts of scholars in the twenties and thirties to poison the minds of the young were but a pretext for this new assault. The Port Huron Statement in 1962 and the founding of SDS formed the initial assault on the staid halls of higher learning. Academia, unable to contain or even properly challenge this misguided agenda, floundered in its response. Aiding and abetting the radicals was the US Government&apos;s entry to an ill-advised conflict in Southeast Asia. Combine the two and University administrations in several key bastions of higher learning fell to the radical elements. The virus had taken a tenuous hold. It would grow and infect future leaders to prey upon unsuspecting minds, inculcating them with a sense of guilt, radical redress and egalitarian fervor.

2) Law Schools: Those infected with this radical new virus could now expand their activities to include law schools. What better way to attain a redress of grievances against a racist, sexist, homophobic nation than to change the Constitution? New radical lawyers imbued with this bubonic sickness attacked our nation&apos;s laws at the principal level. Judicial activists unleashed a torrent of bad constitutional law that would make any radical proud. The links that bound us to our founding were now severely strained.

3)Primary and Secondary Education: The lessons learned in academia could now be spread to the more basic levels of education. Rather than parents teaching their children tolerance and good moral underpinnings, the Hard Left would give no quarter in acceptance of gay lifestyles and gay marriage, wealth redistribution, equality of outcome, and disparagement of conservatism. These became staples in the indoctrination of the very young. The occasional parent outburst has not deterred the righteous from their mission.

4)Entertainment: The Hard Left could now attack the entertainment industry. The poor, limp, listless minds of this industry were ripe for the picking. What could be more important than compassion for the poor, not getting involved in military conflict, and equality for all who had suffered under the dreaded capitalist state? The film industry offered itself in humble prostration to these noble ideas. Films depicting the evils of capitalism and the inadequacy of the free market spawned a whole new generation of useful idiots to spread the biblical word.

5)News Media: This last pillar would prove to be one of the most important. With the help of academia and entertainment, however, it was possible to invade the newsroom without much difficulty. Vietnam, once again, provided a ready means to achieve control of what was once considered an inviolable institution and move it inexorably to the Left. One can remember the hallowed omtonations of Walter Cronkite on the uselessness of continued combat in Southeast Asia. What Cronkite deemed lost must surely have been. So ingrained in the American psyche was his preeminence for reporting the facts that those facts must certainly have been correct.

The infection of the newsroom continues unabated today with such lackluster cronies as Brian Williams, Charles Gibson, and Katie Couric reporting a brand of news so skewed to the Left that &quot;embarrassing&quot; would be its most flattering description. Think of President Obama&apos;s reference to sleeping with Brian Williams and words lose meaning to convey a sense of outrage. Beneath the veneer of an Obama attempt at humor was a major news outlet willing to do the administration&apos;s bidding.

These are the pillars Liberal Progressives have safely ensconced in their method of attack on America. The restoration of our country to a more reasonable state may lie beyond hope. Those of us who can must make our voices heard to all of the above institutions. We have to come in from the wilderness of being afraid to confront Liberals on their ground. We must fight the bankrupt ideas of socialism in academia through the media. The internet has given us an outlet that must not be squandered; it may well provide the ground for a last stand.

We must find strength in ourselves to define our character so that future generations will know what life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness really are. We must articulate what we mean by real freedom, a freedom and equality that will inspire our children and grandchildren to uphold these precious ideals. There is no time to lose. It&apos;s been repeated on many occasions, but should be said again -- If we don&apos;t do it, who will? If not now, when?

       Wow. The Chicago thug tactics don&apos;t stop with conservatives...

 MoveOn Threatens to Push Primary Opponents to Dems Voting Against Health Plan 

Moveon.org has reportedly raised $3,578,117 in contributions to fund primary challenges against &apos;any Democratic senator who blocks an up-or-down vote on health care reform with a public option,&apos; according to an e-mail sent to group members on Thursday.

A civil war is threatening to erupt within the Democratic Party as liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org looks to punish moderate Democrats opposed to the sweeping health care overhaul proposed by party leaders.

MoveOn has reportedly raised more than $3.5 million in contributions to fund primary challenges against &quot;any Democratic senator who blocks an up-or-down vote on health care reform with a public option,&quot; according to an e-mail sent to group members on Thursday.

The e-mail warned that any Democratic House member who joins Republicans to filibuster the health care reform measure will &quot;face an enormous backlash from the grassroots.&quot;

The group also highlights a letter from Democracy for America, the nation&apos;s largest progressive political action founded by former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, which urges Senate Democrats to strip committee chairmanship from &quot;any Democrat who filibusters health care.&quot;

MoveOn.org, which has 5 million members, has become increasingly vocal in its threats against conservative and moderate Democrats who remain opposed to the health care bills laid out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Several Democrats, including Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Artur Davis of Alabama, have expressed resistance to Pelosi&apos;s $1.055 trillion measure in recent days -- underscoring the intra-party rift over President Obama&apos;s top domestic priority.

Obama had planned a rare visit to the House Friday morning to persuade wavering Democrats, but was forced to reschedule it until Saturday as delays push back a vote on the measure.

Among the most heated disagreements among rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers are issues related to abortion and illegal immigrants.

Democratic opponents of abortion -- under pressure from Catholic bishops -- want stronger provisions written in the bill that no federal funds would be used to finance abortion in coverage bought in the government-run exchange.

       The Decline of the Left 

The Republican landslide in Virginia and stunning upset in New Jersey were not the only bad news for the left in the last few months. The Social Democrats in the September German elections for the Bundestag did worse than in any election since the Second World War. Merkel&apos;s Christian Democrats lost some support as well, but the market oriented Free Democrats made major gains and a center-right coalition now governs Germany with a majority of seats in the Bundestag. Polling data one month after the German general election indicates that Germans continue to oppose a left of center government.

The Labour Party in Britain has suffered two seasons of dramatic thumping in local council and municipal elections. In May, the Labour Party not only came in twenty points behind the Conservative Party, but Labour ran third in popular vote - an emphatic repudiation of the ruling Labour Party and its leader, Gordon Brown.

Polling data for over two years has shown that in the next general election, which must be held within the next seven months, David Cameron and the Conservative Party will win a huge landslide victory, ending almost two decades of leftist rule in Britain. When that happens, each of the four major nations in Western Europe will have governments of the right, not of the left.

On November 9th, the Conservative Party in Canada won three of four special elections to Parliament which added two more seats to the Conservative Party caucus and made it much less likely that the Liberal Party, the largest opposition party in Canada, would be able to convince the other two oppositional parties to force a general election.

These victories for the Conservative Party were unexpected, but the victories were in line with public opinion polling over the last few months which showed the Conservative Party winning the next general election. Some polls showed the Conservative Party winning an absolute majority in Parliament while others simply showed Conservatives holding a very strong plurality in the Parliament. The most recent polls show the Conservative Party with a fourteen-point lead over the Liberal Party.

The pattern over the last several years has been clear in the old major democracies of Europe and North America: the left simply ceases to appeal to voters anymore. The right - whatever that is supposed to be these days? - resembles the Republican Party in America. It has yet to clearly carve out what it is for, and it instead represents an anti-left vote.

So while Americans overwhelmingly reject the label of &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; in public opinion polls, and while Ronald Reagan remains the only genuinely popular American political figure, more than two decades after he left office, what &quot;conservative&quot; is supposed to reflect is only slowly forming in the Republican Party, after twelve years of Republican dominance from 1994 to 2006.

There is in America and in much of the West a profound sense of unhappiness with the way things are now and a robust &quot;No!&quot; vote whenever voters have a chance to vote on the status quo or for the policies of those in power. The breathtaking scope of the defeat of establishment backed state questions in California last May is just another indication of how completely out of synch most voters feel with their elected representatives. The anger that conservatives felt in New York 23 -- anger enough to lose a House seat, if a RINO was to fill that seat -- is another test of just how out of touch party leaders are with those they represent.

The collapse of the left does not mean the rise of the right. The end of Gordon Brown does not mean the triumph of David Cameron. The unpopularity of the Liberal Party in Canada does not necessarily mean the victory of the Conservative Party policies up north. The same is true in America. The repudiation of Jon Corzine in New Jersey will mean something only if Governor Christie means lower taxes, less regulation and clean government. Halting Obamacare in the Senate will mean something only if Republicans come back with a clear, united plan for improving through market options the delivery of health care in America. The declining popularity of Obama will translate into change we can believe in only when Republican leaders begin, again, to believe in the touchstone principles of limited government, Judeo-Christian moral principles, and market economies. It is time to stand for something.

       Jim Jones, ACORN, Obama...welcome to the left:

 A Tale of Two Community Organizers 

By Elinor Lynn Warner


In 1970 America, two infamous organizations were gearing up for big things. Wade Rathke founded ACORN in Arkansas and soon after moved its headquarters to New Orleans. Jim Jones was building the Peoples Temple and set up operations in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Rathke and Jones were gifted community organizers utilizing Democrat politicians, a compliant media, and vulnerable citizens to further their quest for power and money. Their identical pretense was helping the poor and downtrodden.

Jim Jones could round up crowds of protesters and door to door campaign workers on demand. Admired and enabled by San Francisco Democrats and media moguls, Jones gathered emotionally and economically needy people around him, pretending to be a minister to their needs. He forced them to drain their bank accounts, sign over their homes and their welfare and social security checks.

Jones gave their money generously to the Democrat liberal elite and stashed millions in illegal overseas accounts. When Democrats needed a crowd of thousands, Jones provided his willing flock. He ran faith healing and miracle scams. He loved and admired communism, Mao, Lenin, Marx, and Angela Davis. He railed against capitalism, but was ready to pocket all that his followers signed over to him. He was a sought after Democrat community organizer masquerading as a man of faith:

We are not really a church, but a socialist organization. We must pretend to be a church so we&apos;re not taxed by the government... Those who remained drugged with the opiate of religion had to be brought into enlightenment - socialism. [Seductive Poison by Deborah Layton.]

While Jones peddled the drug of religion and talked socialism, he imposed communism. Once his followers were hooked, he trapped them in his demoralizing dictatorship, all under the guise of fighting poverty and prejudice. The hierarchy of the Peoples Temple was largely white and the congregation mostly black, yet Jones engineered fake letter writing campaigns to call attention to himself as an embattled racism warrior:

We produced hundreds of letters that were driven out of state and mailed from different locations to members of congress and local government figures... The letters looked as if they came from racists, angry at Jim&apos;s attempts to help the poor and people of color. The correspondence exhibited unharnessed racism, using the term &quot;****** -lover&quot; to describe him and his good deeds. [Seductive Poison by Deborah Layton]

Jones cried racism in the face of an unflattering story set to run in New West Magazine. In an effort to kill the story, he asked the editor:

Tell me, Rosalie, do you believe that this article will solve the problems Marshall Kilduff [New West writer] seems to have with people of color? [Ibid.]


Like recent Acorn whistle blowers, Peoples Temple whistleblowers feared for their lives and reputations. Jones had volumes of blackmail-ready tape recordings of his Planning Committee members &quot;proving their loyalty to socialism by revealing their worst secrets.&quot; [Ibid.]

A true believer who had joined the Peoples Temple as a lost 18 year old, Deborah Layton became a whistleblower and proved to be Jones&apos; downfall. But not soon enough to save over 900 lives, including 276 children. Those with political power just looked away.

Jones understood the necessity of friends in high places.

Tim Stoen [church attorney] was being hired as chief prosecutor in an investigation into allegations that large numbers of non-residents had voted illegally in the 1975 election. Stoen would end up using volunteer clerical workers from the Temple in this sensitive investigation. Later, similar voter fraud allegations would be leveled against the Temple itself, though not proved.

...Jones often-denied ambitions for political recognition and power. It was not even enough that Gov. Brown appointed church attorney Tim Stoen in April 1976 to serve on the California Advisory Council to the Legal Services Corporation... he [Jones] wanted more than to host the Jan. 15, 1977 city wide celebration in honor of MLK, Jr.... more than to share the podium that day with Gov. Jerry Brown and the head of President Carter&apos;s transition team. [Raven: The Untold Story of the Rev. Jim Jones by Tim Reiterman]

The big Democrat names and newspaper editors in 1970 San Francisco sat in Jones&apos; pews and either bought his act or just liked his payoffs and power. But in 1977, things began to spin out of Jones&apos; tight control and a few frank stories of his oppressive Peoples Temple saw the light of day.

Jones fled to socialist Guyana where the constraints of polite society would not hinder him. He paid off government officials and isolated his flock as he set up his dream dictatorship. When the move spiraled out of control, a congressman investigating the group, an NBC news crew, and some disenchanted Jones followers were all gunned down as they tried to board planes to depart and tell their story.

Later on that day in November of 1978, nearly one thousand forsaken men, women and children, virtual prisoners of Jim Jones, were forced to drink cyanide laced Kool-Aid. They died hideous deaths in the communist paradise of Jonestown, Guyana, a perfect snapshot of a communist dictator&apos;s respect for humanity. The media preferred the story line that Jones was a crazed religious zealot and cult leader. The story of Jones&apos; help from friendly big name Democrats was also swept away.

More businesslike, stable and enduring than Jim Jones, Wade Rathke built a nationwide taxpayer funded partisan criminal enterprise. He was also enabled by like-minded Democrats and the media. Partisan protection of ACORN continues today, even from career politicians like Jerry Brown. Remember that Brown assisted Jones by placing the Temple attorney in a position of political power. Brown is either a naïve man or he lusts for the political power both Jones and ACORN wielded. He is not alone.

Now ACORN&apos;s tentacles reach many organizations, including the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), which wrote glowingly about highly partisan campaign work in 2004:

The chair of ACORN and Working Families Party called upon us as family to make our contribution known. Did we respond? YES, we responded!

In 2008, the CPUSA website gushed:

The grand coalition of the AFL-CIO and Change to Win along with National Council of La Raza, Women&apos;s Vote, ACORN, MoveOn and Rock the Vote has launched the biggest ever-independent voter mobilization, which is at the heart of winning a massive turnout on Election Day and after.

Numerous voter fraud and corruption investigations, ACORN&apos;s links to the CPUSA, labor unions and other questionable and partisan groups did not interest the traditional media. Most often it praised and protected this massive community organization. In the face of a couple of young adults&apos; recent undercover ACORN sting, the traditional media was first shamed into coverage, but now has no interest in getting to the bottom of any of it.

Wade Rathke&apos;s replacement, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis, responded to the video evidence of nationwide corruption in her organization with the false cry of racism. This is a familiar tactic used by determined community organizers emboldened by political friends and a sympathetic media. ACORN&apos;s ties to big name Democrats resemble Jim Jones&apos; San Francisco political alliances on four decades of steroids. A glance into Bertha Lewis&apos;s Rolodex reveals the private contact information on Patrick Gaspard, former SEIU VP, and the current ‘Karl Rove&apos; of the Obama administration. Friends in high places prove lucrative.

Like a good communist leader, Jones squirreled away millions in off shore accounts. The recent raid on ACORN offices in New Orleans seeks to find evidence of Dale Rathke&apos;s embezzlement and a cover-up by Wade Rathke. ACORN national board members with sincere motives and questions about this financial wrongdoing were fired. Like many in the Peoples Temple, these members believed that their mission was altruistic, that community organizing was to benefit the needy.

The reality is that both Jones and the leaders of ACORN used the weak and good hearted to line their own pockets and further their own power. Similar themes of exploitation, communism, race baiting, intimidation, and dishonesty run through their stories. Their stroke of genius was to support Democrats and in so doing, buy off the media. Despite lessons learned from the largest mass murder-suicide in history, this formula for unfettered corruption continues unabated.

       The Shocking Lesson from the Climate Scandal 

By Monte Kuligowski

President Obama&apos;s complete lack of concern for the fraudulent science associated with global warming is contrasted by the common sense of Sarah Palin. The gutsy Alaskan suggested that Obama ought to hold his horses on the whole climate change thing until the real verdict is in. Of course, the smartest man in the world will have none of that.

With the outrageous news of deceit, fraud, and suppression of opposing evidence by top climate change &quot;scientists,&quot; many conservatives had expected to see the story unfold a little differently (with actual reporting and investigating). Global warming, aka climate change, has been heralded as the preeminent story of our time. As such, the exposing of scientific fraud in the ultimate &quot;science&quot; movement would have made screaming headline news in a sane world.

Unfortunately, however, we&apos;ve seen a virtual blackballing of the story that otherwise would have had a chilling effect on man-caused climate change (MCCC) theory. At best for the hoax-deniers, MCCC has been brought into serious question (which would imply the suspension of policy and taxpayer funds). At worst, MCCC has been exposed as the fraud that it always has been. Amazingly, and almost inexplicably, since the East Anglia CRU e-mails story broke, we&apos;ve witnessed a barrage of stories promoting global warming as if nothing unusual had occurred.

Here are some recent headlines during the time that scientific fraud should have been the real story: &quot;Climate experts warn: Time to change, or else -- Shift in development and farming advised&quot;; &quot;Global warming may require higher dams, stilts&quot;; &quot;India gives in to US pressure on climate change&quot;; &quot;Dalai Lama says climate change needs global action&quot;; &quot;Toronto is acting on climate change&quot;; &quot;US proposes climate fund for poor nations&quot;; &quot;UN official calls for funds for climate change&quot;; &quot;Climate pledge made by key countries.&quot;

Anticipating a &quot;meaningful&quot; agreement on climate change policy, President Obama recently changed his Copenhagen schedule in order to fully participate with other world leaders. Bloomberg quotes White House press secretary Robert Gibbs stating:

&apos;There is progress toward a meaningful Copenhagen accord,&apos; with an &apos;emerging consensus&apos; that wealthy nations should provide $10 billion a year by 2012 to help developing nations deal with climate change.

Oh, by the way, the Obama-bankrupt United States is numbered among the &quot;wealthy&quot; nations that will be spreading the taxpayer wealth around the world. With billions en route to their coffers, the dictators of poor countries everywhere have suddenly seen the global warming light. Additionally, at the Copenhagen climate summit, Obama will unconstitutionally pledge to cut U.S. emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.

In order to understand how the scientific scandal of the century could be ignored and swept under the rug by the ruling elitists in media and government, one must first understand the fundamentals of liberalism.

Liberalism, progressivism, post-modernism, or whatever you want to call the pathology originated out of and is built upon fantasy far removed from reality. The counterculture revolution which produced the current phenomenon known as liberalism was based entirely upon make-believe. Specifically, the youth of the 1960s fancied themselves somehow smarter, wiser, and morally superior to their elders and all the tradition that preceded them.

A baffling audacity of baseless arrogance is the progenitor and foundational principle by which contemporary liberalism is undergirded to this day.

If you&apos;ve ever wondered why liberals are &quot;elitists,&quot; that&apos;s why. Incidentally, conservatives need to stop referring to liberals as &quot;elites.&quot; There is a world of difference between elites and elitists. True elites are the best at what they do. Often, liberals are not the best; they just think they are. They really think they&apos;re smarter than everyone else. In fact, they are so smart that once a groupthink consensus is reached among liberals, there is no changing the narrative. Come hell or high water, global cooling, or facts that refute the narrative, they&apos;re not budging.

No matter how ridiculous, fanciful, foolish, damaging, asinine, or untenable the idea, once a consensus is reached among liberals, they will not back down. There is a lot of pride associated with being the smartest people on the face of the earth.

The election of Barack Obama is a prime example. Because Candidate Obama was not vetted by the liberal media, the campaign was able to present Obama as the most transparent and post-partisan candidate in history. Of course, the media were not just negligent in investigating the real Obama, but they actively promoted the narrative. It turns out, of course, that the narrative was a complete fraud.

Regardless of the evidence pouring in that shows Obama as both secretive and off-the-charts divisive, the narrative remains firmly intact.

Whether we&apos;re talking about science fiction or some other subject, we must not forget that no matter how absurd the idea, once it becomes the &quot;consensus,&quot; liberals will never admit they are wrong.

As soon as the term &quot;global warming&quot; was changed to &quot;climate change&quot; we had proof that something unscrupulous was going on. Without a doubt, whether the earth&apos;s temperature is rising or falling, the narrative will remain the same: Man is causing the climate change, therefore government must tax and regulate emissions in order to save the planet.

Rick Moran sums it up well: It&apos;s not the science; &quot;It&apos;s the ideology, stupid.&quot;

For those who dare to challenge the settled narratives of their make-believe world, liberals will quickly turn to name-calling and labeling. Those who question the Obama narrative are called &quot;racists.&quot; And for those who question the man-caused warming narrative, the hoax-deniers utilize the &quot;climate deniers&quot; label.

The underlying assumption is that liberals are so smart that disagreement can be attributed only to irrational thought. After all, the &quot;science&quot; is settled and the argument is over.

Inconvenient facts will not change the narrative.

 The Left&apos;s Corruption of Youth 

By Robin of Berkeley

When I was twenty, I fell hard and fast for a dreamy guy named Will. Handsome and hilarious, Will was the perfect boyfriend...that is, until the day he hit me.

We weren&apos;t arguing; we were just goofing around on the couch. Out of nowhere, he slapped me across the face. Though I was shocked, I somehow found the wherewithal to say, &quot;Don&apos;t do that again.&quot;

When I got my bearings back, I demanded to know why Will hit me. He said he thought I&apos;d like it. I discovered that the man was into some unspeakable behavior, stuff I&apos;d never heard of before. And he had had no problems finding willing others.

During our time together, Will put his perverse proclivities on ice. But I could see the roots of his depravity -- his contempt for people, his stinginess, and his narcissism.

Eventually, Will dumped me for another girl. Though I cried inconsolably for weeks, in retrospect, his rejection was the best (and only) gift he ever gave me.

Looking back, I wonder why I didn&apos;t follow Will down this treacherous path. I was needy and adrift, having had no strong parental arms to guide me.

Raised by permissive parents with Playboys on the coffee table, I was brainwashed into an anything-goes attitude about sex. Desperate for a boyfriend, I viewed free love as the road to true love.

However, those 1970s-era Playboys were relatively mild by today&apos;s standards. Will&apos;s predilections were shocking, unheard-of, totally out of bounds for the times. Even though I was young and impressionable, a voice inside me hollered, &quot;No!&quot;

But if I were twenty years old today, with the constant blare of extreme sex, I wonder whether I would have made the same decision. Barriers erected around sexuality have continued to topple like so many dominoes all in a row.

Conservatives have been warning for years that society is sexualizing children. They even proclaimed that militant gays were initiating public school youth into their ranks.

I thought that conservatives were being paranoid and homophobic. What they asserted was ridiculous in the extreme.

And I must now admit that yet again, I was wrong.

True, the average, hardworking gay or lesbian is repulsed by the idea of degrading children. They, like straights, want children protected and safe. And like everyone else, they are preoccuppied with the mundane details of everyday life -- jobs, aging parents, and home repair.

The problem is that these are not normal times. There are extreme, militant gays who have in mind big changes for everyone else. With a key appointment, President Obama has emboldened a cabal of fanatics obsessed with the &quot;fundamental transformation&quot; of sexuality in America.

Through Obama&apos;s election, some of the most ferocious and unhinged inmates of the nation&apos;s radical sexual fringe have been released upon the citizenry.

This fringe doesn&apos;t want to be left alone. In fact, it will not leave you and your children alone. We&apos;re talking about a lethal combination of traits: for many, manic-depression, severe character disorders, and addictions, sexual and otherwise.

The fusion of the three produces the most toxic of people, what I call &quot;poisonous personalities.&quot; Empowered, they are now wrecking havoc in every place imaginable.

Corrupting the public has been on the Left&apos;s agenda for decades. Beginning in the l930s, the Frankfurt School plotted the installation of Marxism in the West. They knew that a debauched citizenry is easier to manipulate.

The school found willing henchmen in the amoral Left, which worships at the altar of pleasure: If it feels good, do it. Their hedonism has been legitimized by a host of mad scientists, such as Drs. Wilhelm Reich and Alfred Kinsey.

A principal architect of the sexual revolution, Kinsey purportedly falsified evidence to support his subversive theories that everyone, babies included, is hyper-sexual and bisexual.

Growing up, Obama himself was surrounded by people with no boundaries to speak of. Grandpa Stanley told lewd stories about women in front of young Barry. Stanley anointed alleged pedophile Frank Marshall Davis to be the child&apos;s mentor and tutor.

Frankly, given Obama&apos;s early exposure, I wonder if he&apos;s desensitized to abuse. Can he see it if it&apos;s front of his eyes?

This possible blindness may partly explain Obama&apos;s selection of Kevin Jennings as the Safe Schools Czar. Jennings, a militant gay man, has been &quot;queering&quot; students in Massachusetts for years.

Jennings and his crew taught the kids about brutal sexual practices like fisting and water sports. They pressured the kids to try out sexual practices that disgusted them.

Not only were these degenerates teaching kinky sex to the young and vulnerable, but they also put the kids further into harm&apos;s way by detailing the best places to hook up.

Sexualizing and &quot;queering&quot; kids is a worldwide trend. The U.N. has issued a proclamation asserting that starting in grade school, children have a right to masturbate and to have orgasms.

I&apos;ve lately been hearing stories from public schools across the land about kids being subjected to deviance. A friend&apos;s fifteen-year-old was disciplined after walking out in disgust when a transsexual guest speaker provided graphic details about his/her surgery. The youth -- and their parents -- have no say in the curriculum.

Many liberal teachers have no qualms about exposing their charges to decadence because they themselves are steeped in moral relativism. It&apos;s judgmental, they believe, to distinguish between wholesome and degrading sex. In their view, being polyamorous is as legitimate a lifestyle choice as uttering &quot;I do.&quot;

But there are also some militant gays out there who are going way beyond neutrality. They are trying to bring lost and aimless students into the gay fold.

School staff may zoom in on a particularly vulnerable youth. A teacher might imply to a molested boy that maybe he&apos;s gay. Or a counselor may suggest lesbianism to a girl being hit by her boyfriend.

It&apos;s one thing to support a teen who believes he or she is gay. But recruiting kids not only into homosexuality, but towards dangerous and degrading behavior? Divorcing any connection between sex and love and marriage?

There are many reasons why people like Jennings are sexualizing kids. I&apos;m guessing that for some, it&apos;s a turn-on. Describing kinky sex in front of a bunch of minors must be a sex-addict&apos;s dream.

But there&apos;s a deeper reason: People regarded by others as deviants are trying to legitimize their behavior, to make the abnormal normal. Even though they celebrate their lifestyle, I think that deep inside they hurt. No matter how much they blame society&apos;s oppression for their self-loathing, at some level they know they&apos;re warped and broken, that the hurt comes from within, not from without.

In an age that eschews religion, they have no way to alleviate the shame, no avenue out of the sewer.

In the not-so-distant past, this nation was organized around Judeo-Christian values. Sexual deviance from the norm, especially towards children, was roundly condemned as an abomination.

And there were paths to redemption. The sinner could cleanse his or her soul by praying for forgiveness from a merciful God.

But with religion maligned, there is no balm for brokenness. Consequently, these deviants turn to Plan B: corrupt everyone around them. Flaunt depravity and sully others, especially unspoiled children. Increase the number of degenerates by bringing impressionable youths down into their netherworld.

Today&apos;s children are more vulnerable than ever before. With the absence of moral guideposts and strong families, children are creating virtual realities destructive to body and soul.

They exhibit themselves on Facebook and YouTube, text constantly, and remain glued to sexually charged websites, even **** . By being compulsively wired, youth are kept in a perpetual state of addiction and stimulation.

They become easy targets for predators -- and not just the derelicts hiding in dark alleys.

The predators are those like Kevin Jennings who are corrupting children en masse. The predators are every single counselor or teacher who steers a fragile youth into a high-risk lifestyle.

These predators are being enabled by a president who is willing to put children at risk to promote his radical agenda. And why wouldn&apos;t he? Didn&apos;t the adults in his life treat him with the same utter disregard?

It boils down to this: If consenting adults choose to engage in high-risk sexual practices in the privacy of their own homes, then so be it.

But we need to send a loud and clear message to the Powers that Be: our children are not available for exploitation. In other words, keep your hands off them.

       OK, more good material on how bad liberalism is...first to California, a state liberals are literally running into the ground with their policies:

 Schwarzenegger to seek federal help for California budget 

Facing another huge deficit, the governor wants $8 billion or threatens massive cuts in social services. He also plans to renew push for offshore oil drilling

Reporting from Sacramento - Facing a budget deficit of more than $20 billion, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is expected to call for deep reductions in already suffering local mass transit programs, renew his push to expand oil drilling off the Santa Barbara coast and appeal to Washington for billions of dollars in federal help, according to state officials and lobbyists familiar with the plan.

If Washington does not provide roughly $8 billion in new aid for the state, the governor threatens to severely cut back -- if not eliminate -- CalWORKS, the state&apos;s main welfare program; the In-Home Health Care Services program for the disabled and elderly poor, and two tax breaks for large corporations recently approved by the Legislature, the officials said.

Schwarzenegger also will propose extending a cut in the state payroll that is scheduled to expire this summer. That cut has translated into 200,000 state workers being furloughed three days a month, the equivalent of a 14% pay cut. Lawmakers would have the option of extending the furloughs, imposing layoffs or some combination of the two.

The governor is scheduled to unveil his plan publicly early next month. Administration spokesman Matt David declined to comment on the details.

The governor and lawmakers have already had to close shortfalls this year totaling $60 billion, as tax revenues plummeted at rates not seen in California since the Great Depression. Amid the continuing budget crisis, the state ran short of cash needed to cover its bills and was forced to issue IOUs over the summer.

Activists were particularly alarmed by the potential cuts to social service programs, which have taken big hits recently.

&quot;Families are struggling, we have an incredibly high unemployment rate, and we can&apos;t afford to cut these programs any more,&quot; said Nancy Berlin, director of California Partnership, a statewide coalition of advocates for the poor based in Los Angeles. &quot;Sacramento has got to pull it together and find another way out of this. They can&apos;t take more from low-income families. If they do, we will find more people on the streets.&quot;

Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, a think tank focused on how budget policies affect low-income Californians, was similarly critical of the proposals for CalWORKS and in-home healthcare. But she said the administration was justified in pushing for more federal dollars.

&quot;There is a strong case not only here in California but across the country for continued federal aid to the states,&quot; she said. &quot;Absent additional assistance we could see state governments prolonging the national economic downturn by continuing to cut their budgets.&quot;

Schwarzenegger&apos;s pitch for federal assistance will hit on familiar themes: Californians pay substantially more in federal taxes than make it back to the state, the crushing burden of unfunded federal mandates, the way funding formulas have made it impossible for the state to trim certain programs.

The governor sent a letter to the state&apos;s congressional delegation Tuesday night in which he demanded more money for federal healthcare programs for which the state is paying part of the tab. He warned that the historic healthcare reforms poised for passage in Congress may add to the burden, costing the state as much as $4 billion annually.

Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), in an interview last week, said: &quot;I&apos;m planning to spend a lot of time in Washington. I have to. . . . The national economic recovery is tied to California&apos;s economic recovery.&quot;

California&apos;s budget deficit has grown so large -- roughly 20% of the general fund -- that some measure of cuts to social service programs may be inevitable regardless of how Washington responds.

Big business may also take a hit. The governor is prepared to support rolling back two large corporate tax breaks that GOP lawmakers inserted into recent state spending plans.

The $1 billion in mass transit and other transportation money the governor will propose raiding is supposed to be off limits to the state for plugging budget gaps. Court rulings have declared previous attempts to get at it illegal.

The administration will seek to get around those rulings through a complex gas tax swap. As part of the scheme, an existing sales tax on gasoline would be eliminated and, at the same time, a new per-gallon excise tax would be imposed. The price at the pump would drop about 5 cents per gallon

The shift would gut a voter-approved measure, Proposition 42, that protects how current gas taxes are spent. Public transit -- buses, rail and other forms of mass transportation -- now receives 20% of all gas sales tax. After the tax swap, that requirement would disappear. The tax swap could also cost schools -- as it would result in the share of tax revenues they are entitled to under state law dropping by more than $800 million.

Jim Earp, executive director of California Alliance for Jobs, a group that advocates for public works spending -- including on transportation -- derided the plan as a scheme &quot;to rob Peter to pay Paul.&quot;

&quot;We&apos;re not solving any problems. We&apos;re just moving money around from one cup to another,&quot; Earp said.

One new source of revenue in the budget: Schwarzenegger will revive a plan to allow offshore oil drilling from an existing platform off the Santa Barbara coast. The proposal was so controversial during last summer&apos;s budget debate that after the Assembly voted down the plan, members expunged the vote, erasing it from the public record.

Bill Magavern, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said the drilling proposal has already been rejected by the State Lands Commission, which typically has jurisdiction over such matters.

&quot;This would be the first new offshore oil drilling in state waters in decades,&quot; he said. &quot;It is something that should be considered on the substance at the State Lands Commission. It should not be decided as part of budget politics.&quot;

Schwarzenegger would count $200 million in revenues from the new oil drilling for the budget.

Most of the governor&apos;s plans probably will confront stiff legislative opposition. That includes his proposal to continue the furloughs of state workers, which he implemented through executive order this year.

&quot;We need to find an alternative for one or two days,&quot; Steinberg, the Senate leader, said last week. &quot;Beyond one day is just unfair and fiscally it doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;

       Not one nickel for California 

Ralph Alter

There isn&apos;t a single compelling reason to provide the girly-man of American gubernatorial fiscal responsibility, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with a nickel from our federal coffers. His failing California remains the poster-child for liberal fiscal insanity and it&apos;s time for the free-range chickens to come home to roost.
Investor&apos;s Business Daily reports that:

&quot;Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has an idea: He wants President Obama to give him $8 billion - or else, he says, he&apos;ll kill or slash most of the state&apos;s welfare programs, cut pay for 200,000 state workers and end two tax breaks for big corporations.&quot;

It&apos;s clearly time to start killing and slashing. For decades California has enabled its spendthrift legislators, feather-bedding public-sector employee unions and welfare recipients (comprised of both native-born and illegal immigrants) to the tune of a $21 billion annual deficit with no sign of sufficient tax revenue in sight. Meanwhile the confiscatory tax policies and unfriendly business environment of the Granola State continue to hemorrhage both businesses and jobs to more enlightened states.
According to the IBD, California is home to more than 1/3 of the nation&apos;s welfare recipients. Their abysmally underperforming schools are home to the 2nd highest paid teachers in America. Despite their utter ineptitude, the state legislators are:

&quot;the country&apos;s highest-paid state legislators, pulling down nearly $100,000, with $30,000 in tax-free money for their &quot;expenses&quot; and a state-provided car for their use.&quot;

In addition, California is rated 48th out of the 50 states in terms of tax-competitiveness with over $493 billion worth of new tax regulations for businesses since the year 2000. Where is the light at the end of this tunnel?
Why should taxpayers from states like my home state of Indiana chip in to support Californians in the manner to which they have become accustomed? Governor Mitch Daniels has striven to create a climate of encouragement for both new and established businesses here while consistently exercising fiscal restraint. Why should we contribute to ensure expensive gold-plated retirement packages for the &quot;the public employee unions that have systematically looted the public&quot; coffers of California and now come looking for more sensible Americans to fund their fiscal insanity
Let ‘em hit the wall and file bankruptcy. It&apos;s time for the insolvent public sector in California to start turning away welfare recipients, closing government offices, and defaulting on public employee union benefits including pensions until they can be renegotiated in the light of fiscal responsibility to all Californians, not just the special pleaders.

 &apos;What are we up Against?&apos; 

By Alan Fraser
&quot;What are we up Against?&quot; That is the title to this two man roundtable that took place in November at Restoration Weekend. Two very bright guys, Democrat Pollster Pat Caddell and writer David Horowitz talk about the Democrat Party and the condition of our nation. Caddell worked for Democratic presidential candidates George McGovern 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980, Gary Hart in 1984, Joe Biden in 1988, and Jerry Brown in 1992. Most AT readers know Horowitz well.

The two spend some time going into &quot;the shadow party Democrats.&quot; And Horowitz even thinks there is some good news in that we may be at the beginning of a kind of &quot;Great Awakening.&quot;

 quote U.S. growth prospects deemed bleak in new decade 
Pedro Nicolaci da Costa
ATLANTA
Sun Jan 3, 2010 6:55pm ESTATLANTA (Reuters) - A dismal job market, a crippled real estate sector and hobbled banks will keep a lid on U.S. economic growth over the coming decade, some of the nation&apos;s leading economists said on Sunday.

U.S.

Speaking at American Economic Association&apos;s mammoth yearly gathering, experts from a range of political leanings were in surprising agreement when it came to the chances for a robust and sustained expansion:

They are slim.

Many predicted U.S. gross domestic product would expand less than 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. That stands in sharp contrast to the immediate aftermath of other steep economic downturns, which have usually elicited a growth surge in their wake.

&quot;It will be difficult to have a robust recovery while housing and commercial real estate are depressed,&quot; said Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University professor and former head of the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Housing was at the heart of the nation&apos;s worst recession since the 1930s, with median home values falling over 30 percent from their 2005 peaks, and even more sharply in heavily affected states like California and Nevada.

The decline has sapped a principal source of wealth for U.S. consumers, whose spending is the key driver of the country&apos;s growth pattern. The steep drop in home prices has also boosted their propensity to save.

&quot;It&apos;s very hard to see what will replace it,&quot; said Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate and professor of economics at Columbia University. &quot;It&apos;s going to take a number of years.&quot;

One reason is that U.S. consumers remain heavily indebted. Consumer credit outstanding has fallen from its mid-2008 records, but still stands at some $2.5 trillion, or nearly one-fifth of total yearly spending in the U.S. economy.

Another is that many of the country&apos;s largest banks are still largely dependent on funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the implicit backing of the Treasury Department.

Kenneth Rogoff, also of Harvard, argued that if the U.S. government ever &quot;credibly&quot; pulled away from its backing of the financial system, then a renewed collapse would likely ensue.

He cited government programs giving large financial institutions access to zero-cost borrowing as artificially padding their bottom lines.

&quot;There&apos;s something of an illusion of profitability,&quot; he said.

       Understanding the Democrats&apos; Scheme 

By John F. Gaski

Poor Bill O&apos;Reilly and Brit Hume. There they were on the O&apos;Reilly show a few weeks ago, puzzling over why Barack Obama and the Democrats are doing so many things that are damaging to our country. Bill and Brit agreed that they couldn&apos;t possibly be harming the nation intentionally, because negative voter reaction would redound to them politically and electorally. Can&apos;t the Democrats see this? Did they suddenly get stupid politically? This is so unlike them. How to explain this anomaly?

Poor Bill and Brit, and many others, indeed. It is time to think the unthinkable and speak the ineffable. Apart from the troubling question of intent, or whether Obama-Pelosi-Reid just have a novel view of the public interest, the national Democrats are unnaturally and mysteriously sanguine despite growing backlash by the American people. Why? One reason: The Dems don&apos;t believe they will ever have to face a real election again. Is their plan not becoming obvious? It is very straightforward:

(1) Grant amnesty to the illegal aliens (the correct term for lawbreaking invaders, regardless of their natural and rational motives) which will create up to 30 million reliably Democrat voters -- especially after being registered at least once each by ACORN. That is cushion enough to carry any national election. Why else could Dems be so fixated on this agenda item?

(2) Speaking of which, between ACORN and the SEIU, the Democrats will be stealing all the elections they really need anyway, starting next November. (The New Jersey and Virginia governorships aren&apos;t quite as big a prize as control of the U.S. Congress, are they? And one wonders what the real margin of Republican victory in New Jersey was, absent ACORN&apos;s intervention.)

Many laymen still don&apos;t understand how the ACORN scam works. To them, ACORN&apos;s excuse that they are merely committing voter registration fraud, not vote fraud, seems plausible. Here&apos;s the deal: Register 100,000 phony voters such as Mickey Mouse and the Seven Dwarves, thus expanding the nominal voter rolls, and the Democrat vote counters then have the latitude to create 100,000 extra votes out of thin air on election night. This is what &quot;community organizer&quot; really means, and Barack Obama is forever stained by his ACORN background. Not that it matters to him.

America should brace for the biggest vote fraud and election theft caper of all time on election night 2010 -- and in the months following. We now know as well that the Dems are guaranteed to win any statewide recount where there is a Democrat Secretary of State. And who, we must ask, is there to enforce the election laws now?

What of Florida 2000? It is easy to correct the prevailing misconception. One can usually tell what offenses against the commonweal the liberal Democrats are committing by what accusations they make against others (into which they project their own tendencies). In November 2000, Democrats did everything they could to try to steal a national election for the second time in forty years, right before a nation&apos;s very eyes, with local partisan functionaries inventing Gore votes out of those dimpled chads. Still, the Democrats have claimed since Y2000 that George W. Bush stole that year&apos;s election, even though every Florida recount, including those sponsored by the media, demonstrated that Bush 43 really won under the law. Republicans have been so ineffective in publicizing these true results in answer to the Democrat mantra that the propaganda has largely taken hold in the public consciousness.

(3) As if they need it, the Dems will be secretly encouraging (maybe even hiring) third-party candidates wherever they need them, because they know that is the way to split the opposition vote. It almost always happens that way to the Democrats&apos; benefit. If people such as Lou Dobbs and Glenn Beck don&apos;t realize this soon, instead of talking up the third-party route, they will only help to ensure a permanent Democrat stranglehold on Congress and the presidency -- although any one of this litany of methods would probably be sufficient for that. So the Dems are actually conservative in the sense of wanting some built-in redundancy!

(4) What do we suppose the extra trillion dollars of &quot;stimulus&quot; money to be spent from 2010 to 2012 is really for? Just a coincidence, or a ready-made election slush fund? How much has already been committed to ACORN and SEIU?

(5) Then there is the &quot;universal voter registration&quot; plan that the Wall Street Journal&apos;s John Fund has spotlighted, granting automatic voting privilege to anyone who has ever registered for practically anything, anywhere, anytime. The Democrats and their henchmen could work with that, couldn&apos;t they? Or why are they so eager to enact it? Their entire history has been to oppose laws that prevent vote fraud, after all. (What could be their motive for that particular laxity?)

These five strategies should be enough to ensure permanent Democrat control of our federal government -- a virtual dictatorship. For them, it is a royal flush. But another part of the scheme may be the most pernicious of all. The worst is yet to come.

(6) When you become dependent on the decision of a Democrat bureaucrat for crucial medical treatment -- after the health care takeover -- how much power does that give the Democrats over you? Elderly voters tend to vote more conservative than younger voters, so letting the elderly dies because care is &quot;too expensive&quot; can reshape the political profile of the electorate. But can we reasonably foresee that party registration or political contributions might enter the bureaucrat&apos;s calculus? Might it occur to the intense partisans of the Obama administration to grant lifesaving treatment to those they regard as &quot;their people,&quot; but not to others? What a neat way to eliminate the opposition! Party registration is already public information. And if they can overturn the secret ballot for union elections via &quot;card check,&quot; how long before they try to impose the same more generally, so they will always know how you have voted? Do not trust the judiciary to save us, either, after President Obama packs the courts with more ultra-leftists.

Chilling, isn&apos;t it? But not extreme: Obama himself has notoriously displayed his disregard for human life by the stated willingness to sacrifice &quot;grandma&quot; to a pain pill and his coarse support for unrestricted abortion -- even opposition to the Infant Born Alive Act, which he has tried to subvert.

When the Democrats achieve literal death-grip power over the lives of all our citizens, that&apos;s when they also achieve their long-cherished dream of absolute power in a virtual one-party state. Now is it becoming transparent (so to speak) what the real scheme behind their mania for &quot;health-care reform&quot; is? Now does it all make sense? This is not your father&apos;s Democrat party.

This issue is not about health care, ultimately. It is about raw political power and the long-promised radical takeover of the United States. For anyone who hasn&apos;t thought of all this before, I guarantee that Obama and his party&apos;s other leaders have.

Dictatorship in a one-party state indeed seems to loom for us. As one prominent commentator has pointed out, the normal order of the human condition is tyranny, subjugation, and dictatorship, with only a couple of respite periods throughout history, including our time in the West over the past two centuries or so. It just took that long for the totalitarian types to gain near-total power in our country, which they are now consolidating over the coming year. What are the betting odds that they will ever let it go voluntarily?

No wonder the national Democrats aren&apos;t concerned about having to face the electorate again. Pity the naïve, hapless Republicans who actually imagine they have a fair chance later this year and in &apos;12!

The long-time president of my university, Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, used to say, &quot;At our school, we ask all the questions, even the tough ones.&quot; How&apos;d I do, Father?

The most troubling aspect of my analysis is that it represents the logical extension of irrefutable, objective facts. At least five of the six premises are no more and no less than observable Democrat behavior, and the other is a mild extrapolation at most. This is not good.

It&apos;s over, America. We are now living under a proto-dictatorship in the United States. In less than a year, the full reification of it will be apparent to all. Have a nice day. R.I.P., U.S.A.

       Here may be the Democrats&apos; plan to steal the 2010 election, and beyond...

 How to Lock Democrats in Power 

By James Simpson

A variety of moves being undertaken by Democrats are designed to ensure their permanent hold on power through engineering a new electorate.

In a recent article, we discussed the possibility that Democrats will introduce universal voter registration (UVR) legislation this year, and we offered that as an explanation for their seeming carelessness in the face of plummeting poll numbers. John Fund of the Wall Street Journal, who originally brought this item to public attention (saying it would be proposed in January), has reiterated his belief that UVR will be proposed sometime this year, although it will await the outcome of the health care bill still under consideration.

Fund asserts that UVR will open the nation up to massive vote fraud. The reasons are straightforward and many. Among them, (1) registering people using existing government databases will result in many duplicates, (2) many of the lists contain names of illegal immigrants; and (3) the list could be expanded to include felons currently ineligible to vote.

Like most leftist agenda items, the notion of universal voter registration has been a long time in the making, but it has been flying beneath the radar for all but those paying close attention. As a result, most of us are behind the curve. The left can thus present universal voter registration as a much-needed &quot;reform,&quot; with talking points and ready answers to objections all lined up, while the rest of us struggle to assess the damage it will do. But it will do damage -- potentially permanent damage to our representative republic.

Voter Registration and Registration Fraud

Most of the calls for UVR cite the fact that about thirty percent of eligible voters remain unregistered. (In the last election cycle, 29 percent were not registered.) The radical left Nation magazine effuses:

It doesn&apos;t have to be this way. Registration rates in other countries frequently run upwards of 90 percent (both Canada and France hit that mark, for example, while Venezuela stands at roughly 94 percent, and Russia about 97).

Venezuela and Russia. How has voter registration worked out for them? They&apos;re not exactly the role models for democracy if you ask me, but then, for the folks at Nation, they&apos;re all of a piece. Just ask Bill Ayers.

These folks also argue that UVR will prevent voter registration fraud. If the feds do all the registering, they reason, groups like ACORN that have been tied to rampant registration fraud -- not to mention all their other illegal activities -- will be disenfranchised.

But a look at who is supporting the idea gives the lie to that one. An article appeared last year on Alternet.org, a leftist website run by former Mother Jones publisher Don Hazen. Titled &quot;Consensus Builds for Universal Voter Registration,&quot; the byline was Project Vote. This is the same Project Vote where Barack Obama cut his teeth organizing for the Senate election of communist-sympathizer Carol Moseley Braun. Project Vote is at the forefront of the voting rights movement. It is also an ACORN subsidiary.

In 1993, Bill Clinton signed the National Voter Registration Act into law. Commonly known as Motor Voter, the law allows for people to register to vote at welfare offices, motor vehicle departments, and other government agencies. These agencies are required to provide necessary forms and even promote voter registration. Democrats billed Motor Voter as a method to make it easier for &quot;disenfranchised voters&quot; to become registered. Note that there was nothing except their own inertia preventing eligible people from registering to vote before this was passed, but the Democrats are all about saving the &quot;poor and oppressed,&quot; especially when most of those poor and oppressed will be guaranteed Democrat voters.

A 2008 Project Vote report titled &quot;Unequal Access: Neglecting the National Voter Registration Act 1995-2007&quot; claimed that &quot;40 percent of voting-aged citizens from households earning under $25,000 were unregistered.&quot; The report further complains that &quot;Thousands of eligible low income voters could be brought fully into the democratic process every day if states fully complied with the NVRA.&quot; Once again, these people are perfectly capable of bringing themselves into the &quot;democratic process&quot; if they so choose, but that&apos;s not good enough for Democrats. The report also observed that twenty percent of qualified citizens making $100,000 or more remain unregistered, but that didn&apos;t seem to bother them.

Motor Voter was anticipated to create a massive potential for voter registration fraud. Events since its passage seem to have borne that out. And while supporters of the law claim that vote registration fraud does not necessarily lead to vote fraud, the danger is clearly there, especially from absentee ballots and in states where only minimal identification is required. It also creates opportunities for voting activists to challenge elections. If the registration process is flawed, they argue, why not the election process itself?

The Motor Voter law was the brainchild of socialists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven. Inventors of the Cloward/Piven Crisis Strategy, these two radical activists spent a lifetime dreaming up ways to wreak havoc upon our government, hoping that the crises they fomented would ultimately lead to its collapse. ACORN has been the main vehicle for this strategy. Therefore, the filing of excessive and fraudulent voter registrations may be an end in and of itself. It certainly has created chaos and undermined the integrity of our voting system.

It also could be the pretext upon which the left intended to base their push for universal voter registration. And while there is little doubt, given the current condition of federal and state databases, that such a move would create all kinds of duplication, Democrats would achieve their goal of getting all of those unregistered fellow travelers on the rolls. Then all they&apos;d have to do is get them to the polls. No longer having to sully itself with fraudulent registrations, maybe ACORN could turn its attention more fully to get-out-the-vote activities the ones it illegally conducted for the Obama campaign in 2008.

Illegal Immigrant Voting

Critics fear that universal voter registration will allow many illegal immigrants to register and vote. UVR proponents will dismiss the &quot;illegal immigrant&quot; objections by countering that such individuals either won&apos;t be counted or could be weeded from voter rolls depending upon the methodology used to register voters. Congressional opponents of UVR will of course seek amendments making sure illegals and felons are excepted. But that is a throwaway for the left. They have something else in mind.

Separate and distinct from UVR legislation, Congress intends to move forward once again on immigration &quot;reform.&quot; According to Reuters, the Obama administration has already signaled its intention to push for this in 2010, including &quot;a path to citizenship for the 12 million immigrants living here illegally.&quot; There are probably more than 12 million at this point. During the health care debates, the Democrats reduced their estimates of people needing coverage from 47 million to 30 million to subtract out illegal immigrants. This suggests that they believe the current number to be 17 million.

Getting the illegal immigrant vote is key for Democrats in 2010. While registering low-income people to vote will guarantee more Democrat voters, it may not in and of itself provide the winning margins Democrats need to overcome their growing unpopularity. And while amnesty would provide Democrats with a huge pool of potential new voters, without UVR, the logistical problem of getting them registered to vote in time for the 2010 elections would remain. UVR would solve this problem, guaranteeing these people to be registered to vote the minute they achieve citizenship.

But it doesn&apos;t end there. Once again, separate and distinct from UVR, legislators are contemplating granting felons the right to vote. A bill, S. 1516, was proposed by Democrats in the Senate last summer. While the Senate bill deals only with felons who have served their time, don&apos;t expect it to end there. An organization called ProCon.org claims that in 2004, there were 5.2 million felons &quot;disenfranchised&quot; from voting. That&apos;s a lot of potential Democrats.

This week, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a Washington state law banning felons from voting. Fortunately, saner heads still exist, and the state of Washington has asked the Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit ruling. The Obama administration likely agrees with the 9th Circuit, however, having appointed felon-rights advocate Sonya Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.

So look to Congress to propose both immigration reform and felon &quot;voting rights&quot; legislation. For all this to work, however, Congress needs to propose universal voter registration first. That way, they can pretend that illegal immigrants and felons will not be included. This may be why John Fund was so confident that UVR will be proposed sometime in January 2010.

But it doesn&apos;t end even there. Expect to hear calls for abolishing the electoral college and moving toward direct presidential elections. That&apos;s in the works, too. It can be accomplished without a constitutional amendment. State legislatures can vote to give all their electors to the winner of the popular vote. Direct elections will become law when enough state legislatures have passed legislation to make up a majority of the electoral vote (270 of 538). Only five states holding 61 electoral votes -- Hawaii, Washington, Illinois (go figure), New Jersey, and Maryland -- have signed on to this so far, so it will take longer to accomplish. But if they get it done, direct elections will be the last nail in the coffin for our beloved Republic.

Add to this the deliberate sabotage of our economy with unprecedented deficit spending, stimulus bills that stimulate only Democrats while unemployment rises to Depression-era levels, cap-and-trade legislation that threatens devastating tax increases justified by a hoax, a health care bill that will make us all sick while dramatically ramping up costs, and all the other garbage legislation designed to keep us distracted, distraught, and demoralized, and you have the prescription for an unprecedented takeover of our country from which we may never recover.

I had hoped that it wouldn&apos;t come to this. But if it is the Democrats&apos; agenda to use UVR, illegal immigration, and felon votes to steal the 2010 election -- and I believe it is -- then they need to know that we are going to do everything within our power to stop them. They represent gangster government, a radical cabal aiming to consolidate power once and for all by duplicitously using our own institutions against us. If they attempt this, then they have lost the legitimate right to lead, and those institutions, by definition, will have been corrupted beyond repair. It will be left to us to get rid of them, and it will be our right to do so by any means at our disposal.

       The disaster of liberal rule...

 California: An Obituary 

By Claude Sandroff

Only raw and unrestrained liberalism could have destroyed the world&apos;s 8th-largest economy. Boasting unparalleled assets in agriculture, high technology, entertainment, and tourism, and blessed with ample energy resources, deep-water ports and ideal weather, California has nonetheless managed to turn itself into a perfect dystopia.

California&apos;s governor offered this in his last State of the State message: &quot;We need to work with the feds so that we can fix the flawed formula that demands that states spend money they do not have.&quot; Certainly that&apos;s a good start from Schwarzenegger, who only recently, as part of a degrading suck-up routine, graded Obama&apos;s performance as president with an A. But pointing to the federal government&apos;s brazen overreach doesn&apos;t address California&apos;s true malady: a self-inflicted, endless orgy of failed leftist policies and programs enacted under one-party legislative rule.

The litany of problems is well-known and oft-cited. We Californians are overtaxed, our state workers are too numerous and coddled, our businesses are overregulated, and our environmentalists are too radical and powerful.

And the list goes on. We tolerate nearly three million illegal residents draining us of $10 billion annually -- enough to pay down half of our deficit through this and the next fiscal year. The educational system is dysfunctional and expensive, while our infrastructure is adequate for the third world -- not 40 million modern consumers growing to 50 million by mid-century. Our energies are diluted by frequent and incomprehensible voter propositions that often focus on divisive social agendas (gay marriage) or are driven by well-funded special interests (stem-cell research).

California is in an exciting race to the bottom with other liberal bastions like New York and New Jersey to see who can best tax its citizens and businesses into oblivion. But California&apos;s stunning fall to mediocrity is alarming because it had to do so much wrong for so long to neuter so much of its enormous potential.

Highly regarded for its nonpartisan analysis of government tax policy and its effect on the business climate, the Tax Foundation publishes an extensive yearly review that ranks state competitiveness across the nation. Its most recent output shows California to be a very hostile place to do business, ranking at number 48 (just behind New York and New Jersey) in overall competitiveness. With a crushing 10.3% top marginal income tax rate (third-highest in the country) and a state sales tax of 8.25% (the country&apos;s highest), should any other outcome be expected?

Late last year, the Nummi plant in the Bay Area, a joint partnership between GM and Toyota, announced that it was closing shop. It was the last operating car plant in California. Northrop Grumman in Los Angeles proclaimed &quot;Happy New Year, 2010&quot; with the announcement that Nummi was moving its headquarters to the Washington, D.C. area in 2011, a continuation of the hollowing out of southern California&apos;s once-vibrant defense industry.

California&apos;s unemployment rate is now over 12%, well above the national average, placing it in the pathetic company of other man-made disasters like Michigan and Rhode Island. First-tier commercial vacancy rates are so high in Silicon Valley that some real estate analysts have labeled the situation a &quot;bloodbath.&quot;

In his lame duck address, Schwarzenegger noted that the cost of state employee pensions is up 2,000% in the last ten years, while state revenues have increased only 24%. In addition to this alarming figure, government itself is one of the few growth industries in the state. The private economy has to deal with high unemployment and small business bankruptcy rates that grew 81% from 2008 to 2009, but fat and happy state workers were able to add 1% to their ranks.

Despite ample evidence to the contrary, Schwarzenegger and the environmental cultists that hold him as a consenting prisoner believe that turning everything green is the solution to all of California&apos;s economic woes. State residents are already burdened with some of the highest gasoline prices in the country thanks to a boutique blend that the rest of the country shuns and only California refineries can make. California has proposed its own carbon tax, while the use of slant drilling techniques that could efficiently extract new offshore oil supplies (and new taxes) from existing platforms has been prohibited.

Though Norwegians and Brazilians -- with as interesting and beautiful coastlines as Santa Barbara&apos;s -- have no problem drilling madly to exploit their offshore reserves, our irrational environmentalists believe that we Californians are too pure to be touched.

California, on the brink of a violent demise, must choose among three fates: rescue, restructure, or failure. Of these, a rescue by the rest of the country would be the most disastrous. If U.S. taxpayers from the other 49 states were forced to save California -- using the same broken logic that &quot;saved&quot; Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and AIG, because they too were too big to fail -- the very notion of a republic with sovereign states would dissolve before our eyes. California would suffer few painful consequences from its liberal mismanagement, while every other state would calculate how large its own rewards could be for mismanaging its own economy. And the fifty states would devolve into nothing but geographical boundaries, like counties within a state.

The kinds of policies that could save California are easy to formulate: Reduce the state government by 30% by permanently eliminating (not furloughing) state workers; eliminate the personal income tax; provide any new business that stays in the state for ten years with a corporate tax moratorium; abandon threats of a carbon tax and open the state to aggressive (not unregulated) offshore and onshore drilling; cut welfare rolls to reflect the 16% share of the U.S. population residing in the state; establish a constitutional amendment limiting increases in state spending to population growth plus inflation; eliminate all benefits to illegals.

But if we Californians refuse to establish a rational economic order, then let us fail, whatever that might mean for our bond rating or reputation. And learn from our mistakes by not following our irresponsible descent into fiscal hell.

       More blatant disrespect from the left...

 Chuck Schumer calls Brown a &apos;teabagger&apos; 

By Jack Kemp

It is getting so that we cannot publicly report politics without a discussion of vulgar remarks, much as during the time of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-Times Square porno store district) called Scott Brown, the opponent of Martha Coakley, a &quot;far right teabagger Republican.&quot;

You can see a video of Fox News asking Scott Brown for his response to Chuck Schumer using the vulgarity &quot;teabagger&quot; to describe the candidate.

The New York Tea Party&apos;s co-leader, David Webb, has created a statement on Schumer&apos;s remarks:


&quot;New York, NY...January 16, 2010 - The senior Senator from New York has joined the ranks of Janeane Garofalo, Bill Maher, Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews in insulting Americans who exercise their rights in a Democratic manner. These stalwarts of Liberalism claim to uphold fiercely the rights of all, unless you hold a position that does not suit them. Massachusetts residents have legitimate policy concerns about Martha Coakley and a 1st Amendment Right to voice them.


Senator Schumer stated in an official email &quot;Martha Coakley is running to fill the rest of Ted Kennedy&apos;s term, and her opponent is a far-right tea-bagger Republican.&quot; The accurate definition of &quot;tea-bagger&quot; or any derivation is an offensive sexual slur referring to the placement of a man&apos;s testicles on a woman&apos;s chin. One can only wonder how the women in Senator Schumer&apos;s offices, residents of New York or any woman who interacts with the Senator feel about his public and official use of such an offensive sexual slur in referring to American citizens he is elected to represent.


On the weekend when Americans celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who fought for all to be judged by the content of one&apos;s character, is this the best character Senator Schumer has to offer?


He owes an apology to all Americans especially women. Senator Schumer is not misinformed, and I welcome the opportunity to speak with him in any forum on issues not insults.

David Webb

Co-Founder Tea Party 365, Inc.&quot;

Is this what New Yorkers were hoping for in their Senators? This is the same Chuck Schumer who insulted a flight attendant a few weeks ago when she asked him to close his cell phone.

       The Democrats Start to Fracture 

By J. Robert Smith

In the coming weeks and months, the best political spectator sport around might not be Democrats versus Republicans or conservatives versus liberals, but Democrats of all stripes turning on one another.

Other than demagoguery, what Democrats are most accomplished at is fratricide (think back to the &apos;60s and &apos;70s). In the wake of Scott Brown&apos;s hosing of Martha Coakley, the Democrats are about to have a good old-fashioned civil war. Pity for them; bully for America.

The Democrats are dividing roughly along these lines: left ideologues against pols, the latter being those congressional Democrats who like their jobs and don&apos;t intend to wrap themselves in the European Union flag and jump off a craggy cliff into the Potomac.

It&apos;s Pelosi and Frank and their ilk versus Heath Shuler and his ilk. But given Tuesday night&apos;s win for Scott Brown in deep blue Massachusetts, it may be more than self-styled Democratic moderates who choose to defect. A few liberals may join in, too.

President Obama is showing every sign of being a cliff-jumper. Word out of the White House is that he plans to go on a populist offensive. In other words, he aims to demagogue anyone and anything in an attempt to divert voters&apos; attention from his utterly woeful, ideologically blind performance to date. And did I mention that under the cover of a hate, resentment, and envy campaign, Mr. Obama and his chief congressional lieutenants, the envenomed Nancy Pelosi and the passive-aggressive Harry Reid, will still scheme to foist statism on America?

While the President&apos;s bravado may warm the hearts of Huffington Post and Daily Kos denizens, and while he may win plaudits from the Davids (Broder, Gergen, and Brooks) and the New York Times (among other liberal mouthpieces) for his supposed shrewdness, plenty of work-a-day congressional Democrats aren&apos;t going to enlist in a lemmings&apos; march into the sea.

Self-preservation is a powerful instinct. The Coakley upending is the fork in the road for Democrats who are more enamored of themselves than stinky left-wing orthodoxy. The marker at the road&apos;s fork points right, toward the middle ground. It&apos;s where these Democrats know they must go if they are to stand a prayer of retaining their seats in November.

With every passing day, expect a few, and then lots of sobered Democrats to take the road right, regardless of the sharp disapproval of Pelosi and Reid or the threats of the White House Capone crew.

Congressional members peeling away from their party&apos;s failing president is nothing new in Washington annals. LBJ and Richard Nixon could have given you earfuls.

But left-wing activists and fundraisers and money-givers aren&apos;t going to take defections lightly. While keeping guns trained on Mr. Obama to ensure his fealty, expect left-wingers to turn other guns on congressional Democrats cheeky enough to scuttle ideology in favor of survival.

Nowadays, the left isn&apos;t so much a movement as it is a death pact. If you&apos;ve taken its money or accepted its campaign ground troops or benefited from its uncoordinated expenditures -- and most Democrats have -- then you&apos;re on the hook. It&apos;s like the mafia: Once you&apos;re made, you can&apos;t be unmade. Woe to the good fella or gal who wishes to part company.

Don&apos;t expect defecting Democrats to go gentle into the night. When the left opens fire on them, expect them to fire back. It&apos;s to their advantage. Positioning will be critical at this point on to the defectors. They&apos;ll need to demonstrate to voters that they&apos;ve separated themselves from the dead weight that are Obama&apos;s health care legislation and his cap-and-tax and immigration reform aims (only liberals can turn &quot;reform&quot; into a dirty word).

This Democratic civil war means that the president&apos;s health care reform legislation is as dead as the Articles of Confederation. Cap-and-tax proposals based on specious climate change arguments and economy-killing provisions are already floundering, and they will go the way of the dinosaur if the president, Pelosi, and Reid push them harder. Immigration reform is a sticky-wicket. Attempting to liberalize immigration laws at a time when the economy is hurting and unemployment hovers around ten percent isn&apos;t the swiftest move.

Watch to see what higher-profile Democratic senators like Evan Bayh and Blanche Lincoln do. Throw Jim Webb in the mix as well. Unlike the wretched Ben Nelson or the oily Mary Landrieu, who have so conspicuously sold their souls to Mr. Obama and the left, the aforementioned senators have a limited opportunity to act to rehabilitate themselves by jumping off the Obama train to nowhere. If these senators are as self-serving as I suspect them to be, that&apos;s three votes that Mr. Obama and Majority Leader Reid can&apos;t count on. And more names can be added to the list.

If the Democrats&apos; civil war plays out as expected, the result will be legislative torpor, magnificent wheels-squealing, and grinding-to-a-halt gridlock for 2010. Much to the relief of taxpayers and Main Street Americans, the 111th Congress will do no more damage...because it can&apos;t.

Civil wars typically don&apos;t have pretty endings. This one won&apos;t, either. A bad economy made worse by a &quot;waste no crisis&quot; president and his henchmen and a War on Terror that&apos;s devolving into an ACLU parody combined with a fracturing and fighting Democratic Party is the stuff of electoral bloodbaths, perhaps eclipsing the Democrats&apos; 1994 carnage.

But that&apos;s for another day. Right now, let&apos;s just thank conservatives, tea party patriots, and independents (and some rank-and-file Democrats) for Scott Brown&apos;s victory. Bay Staters, along with their brethren earlier in Virginia and New Jersey, have a made a stout first line of defense against Mr. Obama&apos;s and the left&apos;s encroachment on our liberties.

       Forty Years of Feminism Now Bearing Fruit 

By Pamela Geller

A new documentary, Oral Sex Is the New Goodnight Kiss, chronicles America&apos;s moral decay. Sharlene Azam, a Canadian filmmaker, says, &quot;If you talk to teens [about oral sex], they&apos;ll tell you it&apos;s not a big deal. In fact, they don&apos;t consider it sex. They don&apos;t consider a lot of things sex.&quot; In the documentary, teenage girls talk casually about their sexual experiences and even their forays into prostitution.

One girl sums up the new attitudes: &quot;Five minutes and I got $100. If I&apos;m going to sleep with them anyway because they&apos;re good-looking, might as well get paid for it, right?&quot;

Azam said that this was going on in good homes right under parents&apos; noses: &quot;The prettiest girls from the most successful families [are the most at risk]. We&apos;re not talking about marginalized girls. [Parents] don&apos;t want to know because they really don&apos;t know what to do. I mean, you might be prepared to learn that, at age 12, your daughter has had sex, but what are you supposed to do when your daughter has traded her virginity for $1,000 or a new bag?&quot;

This is the bitter fruit of forty years of feminist domination in the United States.

Virtue, self-worth, and man&apos;s moral value are DOA in the age of the cultural domination of the left. What an awful stench this decaying corpse gives off, lying in a smoldering, fetid pile of ash.

This is how the phony feminist movement empowered women? Girls selling the it for a handbag? Those men-hating parasites have ruined the glorious exaltation of women in 20th-century America. I know. I grew up in it. All one has to do is watch movies from the forties, fifties, and sixties (before the left culture rout) to catch a glimpse of the status of women. We were then formidable, respected, treasured, and above all...revered. It was as good as it gets.

Azam&apos;s vulgar and depressing documentary is no surprise. The atmosphere is already poisoned by the left&apos;s attitudes toward teenage sex. And these attitudes come out everywhere. Two weeks ago, in Crosby Middle School in Hitchcock, Texas, a member of the Hitchcock school board, Shirley Price, gave what was supposed to be a motivational talk to sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade girls. Instead, she gave a graphic, smut-filled rant about oral and anal sex.

I am sickened by this -- not because I am prudish, but because it speaks volumes about how girls view themselves and their roles, not to mention the ever-increasing diminishing of women in American society.

To say that feminism was one of the worst things to happen to women is being easy. It has been worse for men. The demon seeds of the &quot;liberation&quot; movement are everywhere -- including the epidemic of single motherhood, the breakdown of the American family, the street vernacular of &quot;bitches and hos,&quot; the emasculation of men, and the bone-crushing responsibility of single moms acting as mother, father, breadwinner, chief cook, and bottle-washer.

And what has Obama done about all this? He has appointed Kevin Jennings, the founder of GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network), to be his Safe Schools Czar. GLSEN is notorious for having sponsored a conference at Tufts University at which teenagers were given instruction in an array of risky and dangerous sexual practices. Obama has appointed this radical to head up America&apos;s &quot;safe schools,&quot; but who is going to keep kids safe from him? This is another terrible Obama choice. Whatever one&apos;s sexual preferences or proclivities may be, do not traumatize children. Why can&apos;t the schools just teach reading, writing, arithmetic -- and civics?

But this is no surprise, of course. A breakdown of sexual mores and a flouting of convention is part and parcel of the agenda in every society to which socialism has come.

Mamas, don&apos;t let your babies grow up to be lefties.

Every child in America, all 73.7 million of them, should be kept safe from the leftist inculcation of the public school curriculum. Taxpayer money should be used to help set up home-schooling networks and resources across the country.

We spend more per capita on education than virtually every other nation, and yet we rank close to the bottom in math and science -- so busy are our children being force-fed global warming junk science, the LGBT agenda, a whitewashed Muhammad, and other assorted propaganda.

This is how the left has been destroying America since they took over in the &apos;60s. Now the teenage girls in Azam&apos;s documentary are reaping what the left has been sowing for decades.

       Liberal HATE

 Liberal Hate Speech 

By John Dietrich

When Sarah Palin made Rahm Emanuel&apos;s expletive-enhanced use of the word &quot;retarded&quot; an embarrassment for him and the president, she forced the left to live up to its own P.C. standards. Saul Alinsky would be proud.

Normally, according to the media elites&apos; rulebook, when liberals rant, it&apos;s called free speech; when conservatives rant, it is hate speech.

Members of the media elite appear to sincerely believe that liberals are less vitriolic than conservatives, and through repetition they have convinced a large part of the public that this is true. The reason liberals can &quot;rant&quot; without fear of being labeled terrorists is that their &quot;rants&quot; are justified in the eyes of the media elite. Liberals believe that their beliefs are based on the rational analysis of scientific data. Their opponents&apos; beliefs are based on superstition and prejudice.

This perspective was exemplified by comedian Bill Maher, who explained that &quot;half this country wants to guide our ship of state by a compass. A compass, something that works by science and rationality, and empirical wisdom. And half this country wants to kill a chicken and read the entrails like they used to do in the old Roman Empire.&quot; Opponents of the liberal agenda are frequently described as &quot;racist,&quot; &quot;unpatriotic,&quot; and &quot;ignorant.&quot; Conservative &quot;rants&quot; are not only incorrect; they are evil. It is therefore not &quot;hateful&quot; to describe opponents for what they are: &quot;ignorant, unpatriotic racists.&quot;

Criticism of liberal administrations is seen as destroying public faith in our institutions, and in some cases, it is called dangerous. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, Washington Post columnist David Broder opined, &quot;The bombing shows how dangerous it really is to inflame twisted minds with statements that suggest political opponents are enemies.&quot; During the Clinton administration, columnist Anthony Lewis criticized Rush Limbaugh, saying Limbaugh&apos;s &quot;game&quot; was &quot;to throw dirt on government and anyone who believes that society needs government. In his hateful talk about President and Mrs. Clinton and others in office, he is really trying to destroy public faith in our institutions.&quot;

Recent criticisms of President Obama and his policies have been characterized as un-American. Suggestions that his policies should fail are equated with a suggestion that America should fail. This concern for American institutions may be something new, because it apparently was not a factor in the past. In 1986, Washington Post columnist William Raspberry commented on his view of the Reagan administration: &quot;Ronald Reagan is in trouble, and [we might as well own up that] some of us are tempted to take a certain fiendish pleasure in the fact.&quot; Later, Michael Kinsley of the New Republic wrote in the Washington Post, &quot;The fall of Reagan is a laughable matter. The only irritating aspect of the otherwise delightful collapse of the Reagan administration is the widespread insistence that we must all be poker-faced about it.&quot;

Liberals can demonize entire classes of people. One of the favorite targets of the liberal elite is the Christian right. According to Michael Weisskopf of the Washington Post, the followers of people like the late Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson &quot;are largely poor, uneducated, and easy to command.&quot; These people are not only ignorant, but they are also a definite threat. Chris Matthews has declared, &quot;The group in this country that most resembles the Taliban, ironically, is the religious right.&quot; Rosie O&apos;Donnell asserted, &quot;radical Christianity is just as threatening as radical Islam in a country like America.&quot; This demonization makes it permissible to say some pretty outlandish things. NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu on his &quot;All Things Considered&quot; segment stated, &quot;The evaporation of four million [people] who believe in this [Christian] crap would leave this world a better place.&quot; Actress Megan Fox, admittedly not a representative of the elite intelligentsia, said that if given the chance, she&apos;d urge the fictional character Megatron to murder only the &quot;white trash, hillbilly, anti-gay, super Bible-beating people in Middle America.&quot;

Of course, Republicans and conservatives are the prime target of liberal spleen. Sen. Ted Kennedy gave this description of Republicans: &quot;The Republican Party is basically anti-civil rights, anti-immigration, anti-women, and anti-worker.&quot; Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, stated, &quot;I hate Republicans and everything they stand for.&quot; Jesse Jackson after the 1994 GOP victory claimed that &quot;[h]ate and hurt are on a roll in America. If what was happening here was happening in South Africa, it&apos;d be called racist apartheid. If it was happening in Germany, we&apos;d call it Nazism. And in Italy, we&apos;d call it fascism. Here we call it conservatism.&quot;

Liberals appear to get a pass when they attack conservative individuals. USA Today columnist and Pacifica Radio talk show host Julianne Malveaux expressed her opinion of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on PBS: &quot;The man is on the Court. You know, I hope his wife feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early, like many black men do, of heart disease. Well, that&apos;s how I feel. He is an absolutely reprehensible person.&quot; Nina Totenberg, National Public Radio and ABC News reporter, commenting on Senator Jesse Helms, said, &quot;I think he ought to be worried about what&apos;s going on in the Good Lord&apos;s mind, because if there is retributive justice, he&apos;ll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it.&quot; Former Speaker of the House Tip O&apos;Neill had a less than flattering opinion of Ronald Reagan: &quot;The evil is in the White House at the present time. And that evil is a man who has no care and no concern for the working class of America and future generations of America and who likes to ride a horse. He&apos;s cold. He&apos;s mean. He&apos;s got icewater for blood.&quot; New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis claimed that President Reagan &quot;spews out rage and hate, fear and falsehood.&quot; It would take volumes to chronicle the outrageous attacks on George Bush or Sarah Palin.

On &quot;Late Night with David Letterman,&quot; Sam Donaldson said, &quot;I think he&apos;s [Reagan] going to have to pass three tests. The first is, will he get there, stand in front of the podium, and not drool?&quot; After the audience showed its disapproval, Donaldson responded, &quot;Wait a minute, I don&apos;t mean that disrespectfully.&quot; Letterman replied, &quot;Well, I think we all took that as flattery, Sam, we did.&quot; When Whoopi Goldberg drew a distinction between &quot;rape&quot; and &quot;rape-rape,&quot; she possible provided an explanation for liberal &quot;rants.&quot; They are not &quot;hate-hate&quot; -- simply &quot;hate.&quot;

       Heaviest Element Yet Known to Science Discovered

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California has now identified with certainty the heaviest element known to science.
The new element, Pelosium (PL), has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312.
These 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons.
Pelosium is inert, and has no charge and no magnetism. Nevertheless, it can be detected because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A tiny amount of Pelosium can cause a reaction that would normally take less than a second, to take from 4 days to 4 years to complete.
Pelosium has a normal half-life of 2 years. It does not decay, but instead undergoes a biennial reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places.
Pelosium mass will increase over time, since each reorganization will promote many morons to become isodopes.
This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Pelosium is formed whenever morons reach a critical concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as critical morass.
When catalyzed with money, Pelosium becomes Senatorium, an element that radiates just as much energy as Pelosium since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.*

*missing from this monograph is that fact that, although Pelosium is among the most expensive elements to maintain, it has no apparent useful function. Recent research, however, suggests that Pelosium may actually cause deterioration and ultimate degradation when it comes in contact with truth, freedom, ethics, and fiscal responsibility.

 quote One year ago today, President Barack Obama signed into law the first major legislation of his presidency, the Congressional Democrats&apos; so-called &quot;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.&quot; The Obama Democrats made many bold claims about what this $862 billion bill would do for America&apos;s ailing economy.

Let&apos;s see how their promises measure up to reality.

Obama Promised Unemployment Would Not Rise Above 8 Percent With $862 Billion Stimulus. (Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, &quot;The Job Impact Of The American Recovery And Reinvestment Plan,&quot; 1/9/09)

Obama Claims Stimulus Created Manufacturing Jobs. &quot;That&apos;s right -- the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don&apos;t have to take their word for it -- Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created.&quot; (President Barack Obama, Remarks In State Of The Union Address, Washington, DC, 1/27/10)

 http://www.whitehouse.gov/t...t-of-Transportation/ 

REALITY: Recently Distributed Stimulus Funds Going To Foreign Corporations Creating Jobs Overseas. &quot;Nearly half of the $2.4 billion in federal grant money awarded Wednesday to stimulate the U.S. economy and boost the production of hybrid and electric vehicles went to six companies with ties to places as far away as Russia, China, South Korea and France. ... But because so few American companies have the necessary technology, much of the money will initially go toward manufacturing electric vehicle batteries overseas.&quot; (Jerry Seper, &quot;Obama Sends Stimulus Aid To Foreign Firms,&quot; The Washington Times, 8/6/09)

 http://www.washingtontimes....gn-battery-builders/ 

Obama Promised Stimulus Would Have &quot;Responsibility and Accountability.&quot; &quot;&apos;What I will need from [U.S. Mayors] is unprecedented responsibility and accountability on all of our parts,&apos; Obama said. &apos;The American people are watching.&apos;&quot; (Michael D. Shear, &quot;Obama To Watch Cities&apos; Stimulus Spending,&quot; The Washington Post, 2/21/09)

 http://www.washingtonpost.c...&amp;sid;=ST2009022100948 

REALITY: GAO Says Transparency, Oversight Lacking When Keeping Track of Stimulus&apos; Effectiveness. &quot;The Government Accountability Office said in a report that increased transparency and better oversight is needed to track stimulus money being sent to state and local governments. -- &apos;Questions remained about how to count jobs and measure performance under Recovery Act-funded programs,&apos; the report said.&quot; (Rich Edson and Joanna Ossinger, &quot;GAO: More Transparency Needed To Track Stimulus Money,&quot; Fox Business, 7/7/09)

 http://www.foxbusiness.com/...rack-stimulus-money/ 

Barack Obama and his big-spending Democrat allies in the U.S. Congress, led by Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, have proven, their claims notwithstanding, that their kind of &quot;Stimulus&quot; will only run America&apos;s economy into the ground.

And this massive transfer of wealth to the Democrats&apos; public sector union allies in local and state governments was just the beginning of Obamanomics -- soak the private sector to feed the never-ending growth of government.

In fact, as the Obama Democrats moved on from their bloated &quot;Stimulus&quot; Bill to take over the American auto industry, implement Cap-and-Trade energy taxes, and socialize private health care, they made it obvious to everyone not on their gravy train that they care not a whit for the millions of unemployed who simply want a chance to earn an honest living in the free marketplace.

Americans know that the Obama Democrats have no intention of doing what will really create new jobs -- reducing the punishing tax rates on American small business and investors to spur job growth and vitalize our economy.

So faced with the reality of the voters&apos; backlash in New Jersey and Virginia, then Massachusetts and soon the entire country, they are cloaking their next spending boondoggle as a &quot;jobs bill.&quot;

Sorry, Democrats, but the American people have had enough of your &quot;Stimulus&quot; -- they demand an end to the childish double talk and irresponsible wealth transfers. But no one expects the Obama-Pelosi-Reid Democrats to listen.

       Brain-Dead in Berkeley 

By Robin of Berkeley

A week in the life of an ex-leftist:

Disneyland may be the happiest place on earth, but Berkeley is the looniest. Imagine commingling with people who act like Keith Olbermann on steroids. Not a day goes by where I don&apos;t scratch my head in utter disbelief -- not just because of the insanity, but because two years ago, I was one of them!

So here is an actual week in the life. I hope that you enjoy this snapshot of living at ground zero, the birthplace of such peace-loving groups as the Black Panthers. All of the following events are true. The names have been changed to prevent my tires from being slashed.

Monday, Monday:

I am in Whole Foods examining some (non-organic) strawberries. Out of nowhere, a woman charges at me like a mad bull. She launches into an impassioned and very scary tirade about nasty pesticides and poisoned farm workers. I feel lucky to get out of there in one piece (but without strawberries).

Tuesday:

I spend fifty minutes staring at Obama -- well not Barack in the flesh, but his likeness on my young client&apos;s t-shirt. Fantasize about closing up shop and hanging up my shingle in Texas. But does anyone in those red states actually need a shrink?

Wednesday:

Head over to my local holistic pharmacy for some personal hygiene products. After handing over the cash to the cashier, she stares at me blankly. I look at her, she looks at me, I look at her, she looks at me...until finally I break the stalemate.

I utter the five most scandalous words in Berkeley: &quot;May I have a bag?&quot; What I actually want to say is, &quot;Do you expect me to carry my intimate female products on my head like they do in the third world?!&quot; -- but instead, I simply glare. Upon exiting the store, I am certain I hear snickering.

Thursday:

Over at my local independent bookstore (which, incidentally, isn&apos;t so independent that it would deign to carry a single conservative book), I stop in to pick up a Wall Street Journal. The line is long, and I&apos;m in a rush. Though I&apos;m not in a pissy mood, I might be sending out a serious, no-nonsense vibe.

A woman fondling a Noam Chomsky book sprints over to me and asks, all fake and syrupy-like, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Befuddled, I respond, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; (After thirty years in Berkeley, I&apos;ve learned never to answer a stranger&apos;s question directly.)

She answers, &quot;Your energy tells me that something is wrong.&quot; (Honestly, I could not make this stuff up.)

I say I&apos;m fine; I shed the Wall Street Journal and race back to my office to foil Berkeley&apos;s thought police.

Friday:

Terrific day -- best one so far this week. Strangers have not preached to me; I have seen no Obama bumper stickers. No one has foamed at the mouth about tea parties and Sarah Palin.

Of course, I haven&apos;t actually been out of the house, as I&apos;m taking a sick day. This sneezing and hacking is a most welcome respite from the real (surreal?) world.

Saturday:

If ever I need a reminder of why I stay underground, today is the day.

I forward an e-mail to a bunch of Jewish friends and family. It says, &quot;Remember the Holocaust,&quot; with graphic photos from Nazi Germany. The text informs the reader that the U.K. may eliminate any mention of the Holocaust from its schools in deference to the Holocaust-denying Muslims.

The e-mail ends with a photo of the World Trade Center in flames, with the words, &quot;Let&apos;s not forget 9/11 because we don&apos;t want to offend the Muslims.&quot;

The e-mail seems innocuous enough, so I dispatch it to people, both left and right. Moments later I hear from a Berkeley friend, Laura, who wrote the following, and I quote: &quot;Dear Robin: I am shocked by this mailing. I am not going to pass it along because of the part that talks about the World Trade Center. I think it stirs up racist hatred of practitioners of Islam in this country, and I don&apos;t feel comfortable with that.&quot;

I&apos;m tempted to write back, &quot;What has radical Islam done for you lately?&quot; I&apos;m not sure which is more disturbing -- the United Kingdom&apos;s erasing the Holocaust, or the American Left pooh-poohing 9/11. The bigger question is this: How in the world did radical Islam amass this much power?

Sunday:

The highlight of my week! My sweetie and I hightail it to a magical, foreign land -- the suburbs! After driving thirty minutes, I know that we are heading in the right direction when the car in front of us displays the following bumper sticker: Liberalism is a Mental Disorder. I laugh uproariously while my leftist hubby scowls his disapproval.

It&apos;s a whole new world: No one is all up in my business, the streets aren&apos;t trashed, and I see only see a handful of Obama bumper stickers.

But the pièce de résistance is when I buy shampoo at CVS and the cashier places the product in a bag without even asking. She does so with a warm smile rather than a contemptuous growl! I now know ecstasy!

****

So, friends, welcome to a slice of Berkeley life! If you like what you&apos;ve heard, please support any and all Obama policies. Because the far left would love nothing more than to export its thought police and green meanies to a neighborhood near you.

       The Weird Failure of the Left 

By Robin of Berkeley

I&apos;m starting to dread seeing the postal worker. That&apos;s when my leftist mate&apos;s magazines start showing up. Some days, it feels like Saul Alinsky himself has risen from the dead and invaded my mailbox.

Last month, Jon&apos;s Harper&apos;s Magazine wailed about the White Supremacy movement. But his March/April Mother Jones takes the paranoid cake.

The cover features the most despised life form on the planet: the white male. He&apos;s wearing a hoody and looking menacingly into the camera. The headline thunders: &quot;Age of Treason. This Soldier Is Ready To Take Up Arms Against the Obama Administration. He&apos;s Not Alone.&quot;

The hit piece is all about the enemy within. But the author&apos;s not talking about those domestic terrorists who planned to bomb Jewish centers in New York. Not the infiltration of our military (our military!) by jihadist Muslims. Certainly not the far-left Obama-holic who killed her brother and blew the brains out of her University of Alabama colleagues.

It&apos;s something much more hair-raising: the God-fearing, conservative-voting, white male.

Inside Mother Jones, a rather good-looking young white guy is wearing a camouflage outfit and cradling a pistol. He&apos;s part of a small group of military and police officers called the Oath Keepers. While the organization numbers only a miniscule 14,000 nationwide, Mother has elevated them to Public Enemy Number One.

From the article: &quot;Glenn Beck loves them. Tea Partiers court them. Congressmen listen to them.&quot; The 912 Project and former Rep. Dick Armey are also implicated. In fact, to read the lengthy exposé, you&apos;d think that the multitudes were fleeing to the hills and taking up arms, Waco-style.

The article does everything a good left-wing rag should do: whip up hatred and paranoia. Of course, in vilifying people as dangerous, Mother is the one inciting violence.

Why does the Left engage in such inflammatory behavior? For one, demonizing works. The brainwashed masses buy into it.

In one local example, the Bay Area Patriots, organized by the indomitable Sally Zelikovsky, are being accused of &quot;sedition&quot; by a former AP reporter.

Outraged that the Patriots are holding a meeting at the Mill Valley Community Center, a liberal rants, &quot;We have young kids going there to swim, to go to classes ... I feel our local government has to make a stand against this movement, which I view as seditious.&quot;

By tarring and feathering the Right as dangerous nutjobs, the Left tries to drive a wedge into the Tea Party movement. Their hope is that moderates and independents will distance themselves from the unhinged conservatives.

The Left also amasses power by touting themselves as the injured party. Radicals bring billy clubs to polling places, trash Middle America with a vile sexual term, and bite off fingers. Yet Obama and the Left masterfully paint themselves as damsels in distress.

Take California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is running for reelection with only a 50/50 chance of winning. Her campaign ad: &quot;Protect Barbara Boxer from the Tea Baggers.&quot; Rather than the fiery radical who disses Condi Rice and humiliates a Brigadier General, this Boxer is a true-blue victim.

Even the Big Guy himself, Bill Clinton, has been enlisted to character-assassinate the tea partiers. (Why he wants to do Obama&apos;s dirty work given the Barack/Hillary primary debacle is a mystery to me.) In a month&apos;s time, Clinton has gone from helping Haitians to promoting hate.

In our Alice in Wonderland world, crazy people are normal, flag-wavers are traitors, and the Pope hurts Jesus. And in a truly freak-show moment, a liberal commentator cajoles Obama to get even more gansta.

(Am I the only one out there thinking that the Left, with its combustible brew of domestic terrorists and communists, doesn&apos;t need to be any more mafiosi?)

Demonizing enemies, cracking down on opponents -- these are methods endemic to third-world despotisms. But the Left embrace these lowdown tactics because they see their cause as sacrosanct. Sitting at the left hand of God (right next to Jesus?), they&apos;re allowed to usurp common decency.

The Left also cleanse their collective conscience by projecting aggression outward. They never are the mean ones, the evildoers. Sanitizing their vicious deeds, the Left dump all the badness on the other.

Regardless of the Left&apos;s topsy-turvy version of reality, the way to be a decent human being is fairly straightforward. If you act in an honorable, caring way, you&apos;re good. If you throw your weight around, abuse your power, and whip up paranoia, you&apos;re bad.

There&apos;s a story about a man who teaches his grandson the following: that every person has a good and a bad wolf inside him, battling for control. The good wolf is compassionate, moral, and principled. The bad wolf is selfish, violent, and mean.

The little boy asks, &quot;Which wolf wins?&quot;

The wise grandpa answers, &quot;The one that you feed.&quot;

With every cry of Nazi or racist, with every gleeful joke about Cheney&apos;s or Limbaugh&apos;s heart problems, the Left feeds the bad wolf.

Branding dissenters as Enemies of the State, usurping the Constitution, and disrespecting the will of the people, this evil wolf gets bigger and fatter and meaner.

The moral imperative of the Tea Party movement? To forbid this brutal wolf to win.

I want to close with an excerpt from a favorite poem by the Sufi poet Kabir. Though it was written 600 years ago, to me, this poem captures the radical Left:

We sense that there is some sort of spirit

that loves birds and animals and the ants;

Perhaps the same one who gave a radiance to you

In your mother&apos;s womb.

Is it logical you would be walking around

The truth is you turned away yourself,

Now you are tangled up in others,

and have forgotten what you once knew.

And that&apos;s why everything you do

       More liberal hypocrisy, this time by Bill Maher. Ironic how they accuse us of hate speech.

 Bill Maher wishes Glenn Beck had been murdered at Pentagon 

About what we&apos;ve come to expect from this drooling, lefitst, nincompoop.

Via Newsbusters:

BILL MAHER: Now, speaking of crazy white people, you know about the Truthers? You know who these people are? I had to throw them out of the studio one night. These people who think 9/11 was an inside job, that the Pentagon was hit by a cruise missile. Well, yesterday one of them tried to shoot his way into the Pentagon. Or did he? This sad, he left a, they got him, but you know, he left a rambling, paranoid manifesto on the Internet about how the government was going after his freedom. You know, it&apos;s sad. When we see crazy, senseless deaths like this, we can only ask why, why, why couldn&apos;t it have been Glenn Beck?

You may also recall that Maher thought it hysterically funny when he wished Vice President Cheney dead also.

Is it more nauseating that Maher said this or his audience filled with rabid liberal haters laughed at it?

       The difference between liberal and conservative rule...

 Low-tax Texas beats big-government California 

By: Michael Barone

&quot;Stop messing with Texas!&quot; That was the message Gov. Rick Perry bellowed on election night as he celebrated his victory over Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Republican primary for governor. In his reference to Texas&apos; anti-littering slogan, Perry was making a point applicable to national as well as Texas politics and addressed to Democratic politicians as well as Republicans.
His point was that the big-government policies of the Obama administration and Democratic congressional leaders are resented and fiercely opposed not just because of their dire fiscal effects but also as an intrusion on voters&apos; independence and ability to make decisions for themselves.
No one would include Perry on a list of serious presidential candidates, including himself, even in the flush of victory. But in his 10 years as governor, the longest in the state&apos;s history, Texas has been teaching some lessons to which the rest of the nation should pay heed.
They are lessons that are particularly vivid when you contrast Texas, the nation&apos;s second most populous state, with the most populous, California. Both were once Mexican territory, secured for the United States in the 1840s. Both have grown prodigiously over the past half-century. Both have populations that today are about one-third Hispanic.
But they differ vividly in public policy and in their economic progress -- or lack of it -- over the last decade. California has gone in for big government in a big way. Democrats hold big margins in the legislature largely because affluent voters in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area favor their liberal positions on cultural issues.
Those Democratic majorities have obediently done the bidding of public employee unions to the point that state government faces huge budget deficits. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s attempt to reduce the power of the Democratic-union combine with referenda was defeated in 2005 when public employee unions poured $100 million -- all originally extracted from taxpayers -- into effective TV ads.
Californians have responded by leaving the state. From 2000 to 2009, the Census Bureau estimates, there has been a domestic outflow of 1,509,000 people from California -- almost as many as the number of immigrants coming in. Population growth has not been above the national average and, for the first time in history, it appears that California will gain no House seats or electoral votes from the reapportionment following the 2010 census.
Texas is a different story. Texas has low taxes -- and no state income taxes -- and a much smaller government. Its legislature meets for only 90 days every two years, compared with California&apos;s year-round legislature. Its fiscal condition is sound. Public employee unions are weak or nonexistent.
But Texas seems to be delivering superior services. Its teachers are paid less than California&apos;s. But its test scores -- and with a demographically similar school population -- are higher. California&apos;s once fabled freeways are crumbling and crowded. Texas has built gleaming new highways in metro Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth.
In the meantime, Texas&apos; economy has been booming. Unemployment rates have been below the national average for more than a decade, as companies small and large generate new jobs.
And Americans have been voting for Texas with their feet. From 2000 to 2009, some 848,000 people moved from other parts of the United States to Texas, about the same number as moved in from abroad. That inflow has continued in 2008-09, in which 143,000 Americans moved into Texas, more than double the number in any other state, at the same time as 98,000 were moving out of California. Texas is on the way to gain four additional House seats and electoral votes in the 2010 reapportionment.
This was not always so. In the two decades after World War II California, with its pleasant weather, was the Golden State, a promised land, for most Americans, while Texas seemed a provincial rural backwater. Many saw postwar California&apos;s expansion of universities, freeways and water systems a model for the nation. Few experts praised Texas&apos; low-tax, low-services government.
Now it is California&apos;s ruinously expensive and increasingly incompetent government that seems dysfunctional, while Texas&apos; approach has generated more creativity and opportunity. So it&apos;s not surprising that Texas voters preferred Perry over an opponent who has spent 16 years in Washington. What&apos;s surprising is that Democrats in Washington are still trying to impose policies like those that have ravaged California rather than those that have proved so successful in Texas.

 http://newsmax.com/Headline...al&amp;promo;_code=98E6-1 

   
 quote ROCHESTER, N.Y. — New York Rep. Eric Massa is blaming his resignation on a conspiracy led by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and House Democratic leaders to force him out before a crucial vote on healthcare.

Massa was one of 39 Democrats who voted against an earlier House version of the healthcare bill in November. Democratic leaders will &quot;stop at nothing&quot; to advance the healthcare overhaul, he said.

He also had some choice words for Emanuel during a recent radio interview in which he called the top Obama adviser &quot;the son of the devil&apos;s spawn.&quot;

       May Day, May Day 

By Robin of Berkeley

I&apos;ve never been big on holidays. Growing up Jewish, my family didn&apos;t celebrate Christmas or Easter. And being secular, we didn&apos;t do much for the Jewish holidays, either. Since arriving in Berkeley decades ago, one of the few holidays I&apos;ve enjoyed is May Day, also known as International Workers&apos; Day.

As you can imagine, IWD is a popular day around these parts. In fact, it&apos;s an official city holiday. Along with Malcolm X&apos;s Birthday, Indigenous People&apos;s Day, and International Women&apos;s Day, the school kiddies and the city rank-and-file get the day off. Even some popular places, like Berkeley&apos;s Cheese Board Collective, close in observance.

I considered it a great honor to celebrate May Day, which represents all things Marxist. My deep and exhaustive knowledge of Communism was limited to the movies -- for instance, The Motorcycle Diaries and Reds. Warren Beattie and Diane Keaton appeared so courageous and passionate in Reds, and the guy playing Che was hecka hot. Anyway, Hollywood wouldn&apos;t mislead us, would they?

Consequently, I was deeply disturbed when the Soviets failed and the former Republics embraced the big and bad capitalism. Luckily, I could still wax rhapsodic about Cuba and dream of someday visiting that utopia. Since I&apos;m playing True Confessions here: I even drove my car out of my way to fill up with Citgo, the gasoline from Venezuela.

What can I say? I was an idiot.

Locally, I did my part for all oppressed workers by being a union activist. When I worked at a large hospital chain, I was pivotal in starting a six-hundred-plus-member union.

Yes, it was SEIU.

I didn&apos;t know, wasn&apos;t told(, and didn&apos;t take the time to find out) that Marxism was a very bad thing -- that, in fact, hundreds of millions died thanks to it. The first time I heard of this was weeks into recovery from liberalism.

Having heard something vaguely about conservative Talk Radio, I happened upon Michael Savage&apos;s radio show. I was stopped dead in my tracks when he described the Gulags, forced shock treatment, mass starvation, and other horrors of the Soviet Union.

And then I actually started reading and educating myself. My beloved Cuba and Venezuela were run by thugs who oppressed people a zillion times more than any capitalist country. The workers weren&apos;t living in paradise, enjoying long siestas. Marxism, in fact, created serf-like conditions, with the very few, and the government, stealing the nation&apos;s wealth.

Of course, had I actually been paying attention all these years, I would have seen all the cracks in the Left&apos;s ideology. Earth to Robin: Why would all these people be getting into dangerous, shark-infested waters to come to the U.S. if something wasn&apos;t rotten in Havana?

I also denied what I saw around me when I worked for the government. For instance, at one agency in which I worked, managers were hogtied from ever disciplining or firing bad workers.

And when I say bad, I don&apos;t mean the person who runs late or gets a little edgy. I&apos;m talking about the secretary who had a three-martini lunch and, upon return, punched a coworker. She was just transferred somewhere else, with her new department kept in the dark like we were.

Or the social worker who would get families more money than they deserved and then pocket the rest. While a manager made a valiant attempt to get rid of him, the last I heard, she was gone, and the dude still working there. I could go on and on...but you know the deal. You&apos;ve been to the DMV or the Post Office or your local Social Security office.

Which brings me to today&apos;s May Day celebration -- a unique one, because the Left is now showcasing illegal aliens. While at one point I would have vehemently defended their &quot;right&quot; to be here, no more. Now I wonder why we should be welcoming with open arms people who are doing something illegal. Don&apos;t we have enough deceitful people in this country without importing more?

The Left plans to use the day to demonstrate the worth and value of illegals. To do this, both illegals and legals have threatened violent protests. There&apos;s nothing like ransacking stores and setting cars on fire to win over the country&apos;s hearts and minds!

I know what I&apos;ll be doing on International Workers&apos; Day. First, I&apos;m going to stay the heck away from Berkeley. Then I&apos;m going to relax after a busy week of work. inally, I&apos;m going to raise a glass to that most endangered of species: the taxpaying, working stiff who breaks his or her butt each day to bring home the bacon. This day is for you.

And my celebration won&apos;t even require riots in the streets.

       Progressive Death 

By Paul Kengor

Progressivism is all the rage nowadays, with liberals having jettisoned the &quot;liberal&quot; label for the less maligned tag of &quot;progressive.&quot; In truth, &quot;progressive&quot; is a better name, more accurately describing the movement and its extremely broad, precariously unpredictable direction.

Here is the essence of the problem with progressives and their movement, which is a gigantic problem for all of America: One of the only things we really know about progressives, and that they know about themselves and their ideology, is that they favor constant &quot;change,&quot; &quot;reform,&quot; an ever-shifting, ongoing &quot;evolution,&quot; or, yes, progression. And therein lies an inherent, significant difficulty: Progressivism offers no clear, definable end. The goal post is always moving, forever pushed farther away. Ends are never ends; they always &quot;progress&quot; with culture and society -- all along relying on the ludicrous assumption that the changes are always (or largely) good.

For the rest of us, this ambiguity is troubling -- bordering on maddening -- as we can&apos;t, by the very nature of progressivism, get an answer from progressives as to where, exactly, they intend to stop or take the country.

Such lack of clarity can be disastrous for any group, from a non-profit organization to a company and its shareholders. For a political movement, however -- one that endeavors to run a nation (if not a world) and exact policies that increasingly regulate and control individuals and their lives and property -- it is terribly alarming. In fact, it ought to give contemporary &quot;liberals&quot; pause.

Consider what else we know about progressives, evident from a track record of roughly one hundred years: They consistently advocate more and more centralization of power through collectivism and wealth redistribution. Inescapably, this leads to a progressively powerful state, one composed of widening regulations and agencies and departments -- launched mainly under the presidencies of Wilson, FDR, LBJ, Carter, and now Obama -- fueled by a (literal) progressive federal income tax that in less than thirty years skyrocketed from 1% (1913) to over 90% (1940s). It is a one-way expansion of power sliding almost entirely toward the national government.

Needless to say, this is, as a matter of plain fact, fundamentally antithetical to America itself -- that is, our republic as conceived by its founders. The American system is based on limited government, on eschewing a single federal Leviathan, on limited taxation, and on circumscribed control over the citizenry. Of course, to the progressive, this means that the Constitution itself is unsuitable, as it too must always evolve; the Constitution is always a work in progress, never good enough, and certainly not etched in stone. (It&apos;s exasperating when progressive presidents like Obama and FDR wrap themselves in a publicly professed love for the Constitution. This is rhetorical pabulum -- mere cynical public relations.)

As for those of us who are conservatives, who basically define ourselves by a shared vision with the American founders as expressed in sacred political documents like the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and, among others, the Federalist Papers, progressivism is a political nightmare. For conservatives, the public knows more or less where our goalpost sits: it was erected circa 1776. We believe that America got the framework right long ago.

As one of our few truly conservative presidents, Calvin Coolidge, put it in an extraordinary speech flagged by my colleague John Van Til, we seek &quot;to reaffirm and reestablish those old theories and principles which time and the unerring logic of events have demonstrated to be sound.&quot; We believe that the ideals of 1776 must be maintained. That year included not only America&apos;s Declaration, which spoke to the ages when it invoked the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but also the essential wisdom of Adam Smith&apos;s The Wealth of Nations. Going back farther still, conservatives ground their philosophy in the Biblical superstructure of moral absolutes, as did the founders.

Can&apos;t our progressive friends likewise give us some semblance of guidelines? Alas, they cannot, by their very definition. And their aversion to absolutes is made far worse by the reality that modern progressives, unlike their forebears at the start of the last century, are shockingly secular. (Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt, for instance, were devoutly religious.)

Now, with that said, here&apos;s where the confusion has the potential to become downright lethal: It&apos;s bad enough when progressives get their hands on the federal government. There, their penchant for increased centralization ultimately bankrupts a nation. Yet, think about the consequences of their philosophy when applied to the very life and culture of America. Consider the progression by progressives on Culture of Life issues.

Take the example of Planned Parenthood, dear to the progressive heart. It took off in the 1920s and 1930s under Margaret Sanger, initially as the American Birth Control League. At first, Sanger and friends wanted birth control. They also advocated eugenics. Sanger was a racial eugenicist. She had hideous views, not only toward the poor (&quot;human weeds,&quot; she called them), to the mentally disabled (&quot;imbeciles&quot; and &quot;morons&quot;), but, among others, to black Americans. On these last, progressives today dare not raise the grim specter of Sanger&apos;s &quot;Negro Project&quot; or infamous 1926 speech to a KKK rally in New Jersey.

But what about abortion? That gets to my general point in this article: The Planned Parenthood progressives weren&apos;t there yet. They had to warm up to the annihilation of the unborn.

Indeed, it will shock pro-lifers and pro-choicers alike to hear this, but Margaret Sanger initially denounced abortion. &quot;It [abortion] is an alternative that I cannot too strongly condemn,&quot; wrote Sanger in the January 27, 1932 edition of The Nation (page 103). &quot;[T]he practice of it merely for limitation of offspring is dangerous and vicious. ... [S]ome ill-informed persons have the notion that when we speak of birth control we include abortion as a method. We certainly do not.&quot;

Nonetheless, for these progressives, what began as birth control and eugenics -- aimed at stopping life at conception -- needed only a few decades to snuff out life after conception, to the point where Sanger&apos;s organization is now the world&apos;s largest provider of abortion. Sanger&apos;s progressive progeny picked up her torch and set the barn ablaze.

As with nearly everything progressives do, where they started wasn&apos;t enough. Birth control and eugenics couldn&apos;t satiate the lust, which became a bloodlust for &quot;abortion rights.&quot; Planned Parenthood&apos;s progressives blindly bowed to the next level, beckoned by what Pope Benedict XVI calls &quot;the anonymous power of changing moods and current fashion.&quot; (Such power, notes Benedict, crucifies truth.)

And, naturally, once legalized abortion came along, it, too, was not enough, which brings us to where we are now. Today, the progressives running the asylum are telling us that abortion ought to be funded by taxpayers. Here&apos;s a new nadir in their evolutionary chain, one poised to poison the very soul of America.

Abortion, likewise, will not be enough; no single issue ever is. So what&apos;s next in the progressives&apos; progression in the Death Culture? Euthanasia? That&apos;s where their European brethren have arrived. Death panels?

Where does the train stop? Where does the march that advances the Culture of Death finally cease?

It serves us all -- including unborn future generations -- to want answers to some hard questions as far as ultimate objectives are concerned. I beg progressives for some kind of contours, a guess at a vague estimate: Could you please, this time around -- where human life is concerned -- establish some boundaries, set an end-goal or two, offer an inkling of predictability, a modicum of reasonable expectation, some flicker of a suggestion as to where you want to go?

Unfortunately, they can&apos;t, as such is the crux of their philosophy. It looks like progressivism is nothing more than another manifestation of the left&apos;s rot of moral relativism, changing terms, definitions, and, indeed, truth itself -- on matters like life itself -- as the march merrily moves along.

This is very disconcerting stuff, voted into office by millions of oblivious Americans who mindlessly voted for &quot;change.&quot; Well, it is progressive change that they&apos;ll now get.

       The LIBERAL media. It goes all the way back to Walter Cronkite...

 The most trusted man in America? 

By Russ Vaughn

The only member of my family who doesn&apos;t look at me like I&apos;m crazy when I express my utter contempt for Walter Cronkite is my wife; and convincing her that the kindly, avuncular, old Walter was a traitor in my eyes took the first several years of our marriage. She could better understand why John Kerry and Jane Fonda were in my Triumvirate of Traitors but Uncle Walter was more of a leap.

Maybe this latest revelation, that Cronkite wasn&apos;t just reporting slanted news on the war but was in the business of manufacturing news critical of the war. Yes I know that if you read through the entire article there is a disclaimer by his son where he discounts the veracity of FBI informers but what else is he going to say, &quot;Yeah, daddy was an unprincipled, jerk who used his powerful podium to sell out our brave troops all because he was a closet liberal?&quot;

In fact, before his death, Cronkite did confess his well known liberal persuasion and in fact seemed quite proud of it. I wonder if the old useful idiot, lying on his deathbed, gave any thought to the damage he helped to inflict on his nation, and if so, was he still so proud of it?

For those of you too young to understand the still-simmering anger of old Vietnam War vets to, the so-called, &quot;Most trusted man in America,&quot; perhaps a few of paragraphs from David Horowitz&apos; Discover the Networks website will make things a bit clearer for you.

In April 1962 Cronkite succeeded veteran Douglas Edwards as Anchor and Managing Editor of the CBS Evening News, a position Cronkite would keep until his retirement in 1981.

From the outset, critics accused Cronkite of politically slanting the news to the left. This bias, they said, was evidenced not so much by Cronkite&apos;s words as by his choice of what stories CBS covered, and by his habit of raising his eyebrows and scowling to show his disapproval of statements made by conservatives and Republicans. In 1964, amid accusations of such bias, CBS replaced Cronkite as anchor at the political conventions with Robert Trout and Roger Mudd.

Cronkite strongly influenced the politics and outcome of the Vietnam War. In 1968 the Communist forces in South Vietnam, facing defeat, staged massive kamikaze attacks on U.S. positions in Saigon and elsewhere during the Chinese New Year celebration called Tet. This suicidal &quot;Tet Offensive&quot; was a military disaster that cost the lives of 100 Communist fighters for every American killed. But as a top Communist general said years later on the Public Broadcasting Service documentary series Vietnam, those on the left in the American press turned this Marxist military defeat into a political victory for the Communist side.

&quot;It seems now more certain than ever,&quot; Walter Cronkite told his audience in a de facto editorial, &quot;that the bloody experience of Vietnam is a stalemate&quot; and that the war was &quot;unwinnable.&quot; Cronkite&apos;s statement and call for U.S. withdrawal helped turn public opinion against the war. It also demoralized American troops and Democratic President Lyndon Johnson, who was said to have declared that losing Cronkite&apos;s support meant he had lost the backing of Middle America.

When Republican President Richard Nixon refused to withdraw U.S. forces from Vietnam, the Democrats used the Watergate scandal to topple his presidency. Cronkite played a key role in the political process that ousted Nixon -- chiefly by broadcasting a news story every night on the CBS Evening News under the banner &quot;Watergate.&quot; At the time, Cronkite insisted that he was non-partisan, objective and fair. After his retirement, however, he acknowledged his liberal political views.

&quot;Everybody knows that there&apos;s a liberal, that there&apos;s a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents,&quot; said Cronkite in 1996, speaking to his colleagues at the Radio and TV Correspondents Association dinner.

       Woody Allen pines for Obama &apos;dictatorship&apos; 

By Phil Boehmke

I never cease to marvel at the political brilliance of the Hollywood crowd. The greatest beneficiaries of free market capitalism seem to have an unnatural attraction to leftist dictators. Jean-Bertrand Aristide (even in exile) can always count on his dear comrade Danny Glover, Hugo Chavez can rely on the propaganda efforts of his amigo Sean Penn (recently sentenced to Anger Management therapy) and there have been a plethora of Hollywood&apos;s fellow travelers in the embrace of Fidel Castro over the years.

Not to be outdone in the category of audacious hopes for dictatorial governance, Woody Allen has shared his political fantasy with us. Our friends at Fox, report that.

In an interview published by Spanish language newspaper La Vanguardia (that we translated), Allen says &quot;I am pleased with Obama. I think he&apos;s brilliant. The Republican Party should get out of his way and stop trying to hurt him.&quot;

But wait-there&apos;s more.

The director said &quot;it would be good...if he could be dictator for a few years because he could do a lot of good things quickly.&quot;

This is the sort of brilliant political insight that one would expect from a man who.

...took nude photos of his lover Mia Farrow&apos;s teen-age adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, and then ended up marrying her after separating from Farrow.

Gee if only Obama could be dictator, would he have a place for Woody in his regime? Perhaps as &quot;safe schools czar.&quot; And if only Woody Allen had studied history, then he would have learned what sort of things a dictator usually does quickly.

 quote Some people have the vocabulary to sum up things in a way you can understand them. This quote came from the Czech Republic. Someone over there has it figured out. We have a lot of work to do.
“The danger to America is not Barack Obama but a citizenry capable of entrusting a man like him with the Presidency. It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president.&quot;

&quot;The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince.

The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools such as those who made him their president.”

       The Agony of the Liberals 

They doubted him during the health care debate. They second-guessed his Afghanistan policy. They’ve fretted over his coziness with Wall Street and his comfort with executive power.

But now is the summer of their discontent. From MSNBC to “The Daily Show,” from The Huffington Post to the halls of Congress, movement liberals have had just about enough of Barack Obama.

The catalyst was last week’s lackluster Oval Office address, but the real complaints run deeper. Many liberals look at this White House and see a presidency adrift — unable to respond effectively to the crisis in the gulf, incapable of rallying the country to great tasks like the quest for clean energy, and unwilling to do what it takes to jump-start the economy.

American liberalism has always had a reputation for fractiousness and frantic self-critique. But even by those standards, the current bout of anguish over the Obama presidency seems bizarrely disproportionate.

This is the same Barack Obama, after all, who shepherded universal health care, the dream of liberals since the days of Harry Truman (if not Thomas Paine), through several near-death experiences and finally into law. It’s the same Obama who staked the fate of the American economy on a $787 billion exercise in Keynesian pump-priming. It’s the same Obama who has done more to advance liberal priorities than any president since Lyndon Johnson.

Yet many on the left are talking as if he’s no better for liberalism than Bill Clinton circa 1996 — another compromiser, another triangulator and another disappointment.

At work in this liberal panic are two intellectual vices, and one legitimate fear. The first vice is the worship of presidential power: the belief that any problem, any crisis, can be swiftly solved by a strong government, and particularly a strong executive. A gushing oil well, a recalcitrant Congress, a public that’s grown weary of grand ambitions — all of these challenges could be mastered, Obama’s leftward critics seem to imagine, if only he were bolder or angrier, or maybe just more determined.

This vice isn’t confined to liberals: you can see it at work when foreign policy hawks suggest that mere presidential “toughness” is the key to undoing Iran’s clerical regime, or disarming North Korea. But it runs deepest among progressives. When Rachel Maddow fantasized last week about how Obama should simply dictate energy legislation to a submissive Congress, she was unconsciously echoing midcentury liberal theoreticians of the presidency like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who often wrote as if a Franklin Roosevelt or a John F. Kennedy could run the country by fiat. (They couldn’t.)

The second vice is an overweening faith in theory. It’s now conventional wisdom among Obama’s liberal critics that the White House has been insufficiently ambitious about deficit spending. The economy is stuck in neutral, they argue, because Obama didn’t push last year’s recovery act up over a trillion dollars, and hasn’t pressed hard enough for a second major stimulus.

Technically, they could be right — but only in the same way that it’s possible that the Iraq War would have been a ringing success if only we’d invaded with a million extra soldiers. The theory is unfalsifiable because the policy course is imaginary. Maybe in some parallel universe there’s a Congress that would be willing to borrow and spend trillions in stimulus dollars, despite record deficits, if that’s what liberal economists said the situation required. But not in this one.

Yet the liberal drumbeat continues. As Tyler Cowen wrote last week: “advocates of fiscal stimulus make it sound as simple as solving an undergraduate homework problem and ... sometimes genuinely do not realize how much the rest of the world, including politicians, views them as simply being very convinced by their own theory.” Nor do they acknowledge how much risk those same politicians have already taken on (with the first stimulus, the health care bill, and much else besides) in the name of theoretical propositions, while reaping little for their efforts save an ever-grimmer fiscal picture.

But it’s here, with the looming fiscal crisis, that the more legitimate liberal fear comes in. Liberals had hoped that Obama’s election marked the beginning of a long progressive era — a new New Deal, a greater Great Society. Instead, from the West Coast to Western Europe, the welfare state is in crisis everywhere they look. The future suddenly seems to belong to austerity and retrenchment — and even, perhaps, to conservatism.

In this environment, the rage against Obama for not doing more, now, faster, becomes at least somewhat understandable. It’s not that he hasn’t done a great deal for liberals during his 18 months in office. It’s that liberalism itself may be running out of time.

       The slippery bastard liberals plan to wait until the lame-duck session, after they get voted out but before the new members of Congress are sworn in, to pass all the over-the-top crap they know will cost them their jobs:

 The Obama-Pelosi Lame Duck Strategy 

Union &apos;card-check,&apos; cap and trade, and so much more.

By JOHN FUND

Democratic House members are so worried about the fall elections they&apos;re leaving Washington on July 30, a full week earlier than normal—and they won&apos;t return until mid-September. Members gulped when National Journal&apos;s Charlie Cook, the Beltway&apos;s leading political handicapper, predicted last month &quot;the House is gone,&quot; meaning a GOP takeover. He thinks Democrats will hold the Senate, but with a significantly reduced majority.

The rush to recess gives Democrats little time to pass any major laws. That&apos;s why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don&apos;t want to defend before November. Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.

&quot;I&apos;ve got lots of things I want to do&quot; in a lame duck, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W. Va.) told reporters in mid June. North Dakota&apos;s Kent Conrad, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, wants a lame-duck session to act on the recommendations of President Obama&apos;s deficit commission, which is due to report on Dec. 1. &quot;It could be a huge deal,&quot; he told Roll Call last month. &quot;We could get the country on a sound long-term fiscal path.&quot; By which he undoubtedly means new taxes in exchange for extending some, but not all, of the Bush-era tax reductions that will expire at the end of the year.

In the House, Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters last month that for bills like &quot;card check&quot;—the measure to curb secret-ballot union elections—&quot;the lame duck would be the last chance, quite honestly, for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, chair of the Senate committee overseeing labor issues, told the Bill Press radio show in June that &quot;to those who think [card check] is dead, I say think again.&quot; He told Mr. Press &quot;we&apos;re still trying to maneuver&quot; a way to pass some parts of the bill before the next Congress is sworn in.

Other lame-duck possibilities? Senate ratification of the New Start nuclear treaty, a federally mandated universal voter registration system to override state laws, and a budget resolution to lock in increased agency spending.

Then there is pork. A Senate aide told me that &quot;some of the biggest porkers on both sides of the aisle are leaving office this year, and a lame-duck session would be their last hurrah for spending.&quot; Likely suspects include key members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Congress&apos;s &quot;favor factory,&quot; such as Pennsylvania Democrat Arlen Specter and Utah Republican Bob Bennett.

Conservative groups such as FreedomWorks are alarmed at the potential damage, and they are demanding that everyone in Congress pledge not to take up substantive legislation in a post-election session. &quot;Members of Congress are supposed to represent their constituents, not override them like sore losers in a lame-duck session,&quot; Rep. Tom Price, head of the Republican Study Committee, told me.

It&apos;s been almost 30 years since anything remotely contentious was handled in a lame-duck session, but that doesn&apos;t faze Democrats who have jammed through ObamaCare and are determined to bring the financial system under greater federal control.

Mike Allen of Politico.com reports one reason President Obama failed to mention climate change legislation during his recent, Oval Office speech on the Gulf oil spill was that he wants to pass a modest energy bill this summer, then add carbon taxes or regulations in a conference committee with the House, most likely during a lame-duck session. The result would be a climate bill vastly more ambitious, and costly for American consumers and taxpayers, than moderate &quot;Blue Dogs&quot; in the House would support on the campaign trail. &quot;We have a lot of wiggle room in conference,&quot; a House Democratic aide told the trade publication Environment&amp;Energy Daily last month.

Many Democrats insist there will be no dramatic lame-duck agenda. But a few months ago they also insisted the extraordinary maneuvers used to pass health care wouldn&apos;t be used. Desperate times may be seen as calling for desperate measures, and this November the election results may well make Democrats desperate.

       The Unhealthy Motivations of Liberals 

By Curtis Frantz

In general, low self-esteem and a lack of self-love are the basis for the ideology of liberals.

Liberals are those who would use government to reduce the freedoms of some people to provide benefits for others. Liberals argue for fairness and equality for all people, but neither is possible. Other than identical twins, all people are genetically different, and without exception, each has unique life experiences that are interpreted differently. We are necessarily and naturally unequal in a worldly sense. (If &quot;all men are created equal&quot; in a Godly sense, nothing more needs to be done to ensure it.) Liberals, progressives, socialists, fascists, communists, and statists seek similar means to the same end. They want control of an expansive, intrusive government using taxation, regulation, and takeover of private property and businesses to achieve an earthly equality -- an equality that is unnatural, unhealthy, and unattainable. This irrational political ideology is rooted in psychological shortcomings.

The U.S. Constitution correctly identifies the purpose of government as protecting the freedoms of its people. Being free is the natural state of all lifeforms. Soldiers risk their lives and die fighting for freedom...not equality. The Statue of Liberty welcomes those &quot;yearning to breathe free.&quot;

Having an internalized sense of being less than others drives a desire for equality. The liberal&apos;s internal motivation is: &quot;If we are all the same, I can&apos;t be less.&quot; From a practical perspective, making people or situations equal involves punishing the successful; which can be a welcome expression of jealous anger for those with low self-esteem.

Having low self-esteem makes freedom something to fear. Freedom means being free to succeed or fail. For those with a low sense of self, the expectation is that one&apos;s failure is inevitable. Freedom is not desirable under those conditions.

Liberals&apos; personal problems become a societal problem when liberals try to address them by requiring changes to the lives of others. They seek a government with extensive power and reach that can limit freedoms and penalize success so that we seem to be more equal. It&apos;s as if I were to address a problem of poor posture by requiring everyone else to slouch. The adequacy of self-love or self-esteem one has is not determined by comparison to others. It is not measured by net worth, which government can adjust. Whether one has healthy levels of self-love and self-esteem is determined by personal physiology and psychology. No matter how much government can disrupt the lives of its citizens, it cannot make anyone love or esteem themselves more or make anyone happy.

What liberals really need -- greater self-esteem and self-love -- government is completely powerless to provide.

Given their motivations, statements, and actions, liberal politicians and their supporters can be understood through awareness of the common characteristics of those with a low sense of self.

Low Sense of Self Characteristics

Feelings About Self

Has a general sense of unhappiness, depression, unease, malaise
Feels a victim, largely powerless
Fears looking foolish and is unable to laugh at self
Afraid of forming own opinion and having it challenged
Takes disagreements as personal affronts, seeks revenge
Prone to rapid and sudden anger or sadness
Seeks to suppress &quot;bad&quot; emotions; afraid they may become all-consuming

Thoughts about Self

Tends towards negative attitude and pessimism
Lacks confidence in self
Rigid
Blind to unpleasant realities, delusional
Over-dependence on people or things
Inability to accept criticism

Presenting Self to Others

Secretive
Exaggerates, pretends, and lies to conceal insecurity
Arrogant and boastful (intended to appear self-confident) or extremely shy (to avoid inspection)
Cool, detached, aloof (intended to appear &quot;in control&quot;)
Uses language for its emotive value to persuade others
Seeks first for others to connect with him/her emotionally
Denies mistakes and blames others when things for which he/she is responsible go badly
Takes credit for others&apos; achievements
Irrational (psychology trumps philosophy)
Breaks agreements, violates professed standards, hypocritical
Performs poorly in pressure situations

Perception of Others

Projects own inadequacies and motives onto others
Sees others as impotent victims
Jealous and envious of others, especially those perceived as having a high sense of self
Fear of or hostility towards others, blaming others for own inner state

Relationships with Others

Drawn to others with a low sense of self
Has difficulty loving others
Seeks control and power over others
Outwardly aggressive or passively aggressive
Discards people when they become a personal liability

Efforts at Self-Improvement

Does not seek self-improvement, as it requires acknowledging one is currently lacking
Lacks self-discipline
Closed-minded, unwilling to accept new ideas
Tends to have addictions -- they serve as personal distractions

Our sense of self-value is rooted in our childhood, nurtured by the love and affirmation we received from our parental figures. Consider the nation&apos;s leading liberal, President Barack Obama, and how he embodies nearly all the characteristics of a person with a low sense of self. Barack Obama&apos;s teenage mom became pregnant out of wedlock, had two failed marriages, and apparently was a socialist. His dad was -- or became -- an alcoholic, physically abusive polygamist and communist. The likelihood of such needy and damaged people being healthy, nurturing parents is nil.

Obama&apos;s childhood included an early abandonment by his father; abandonment by his stepfather; abandonment by his mother; frequent moves so he could not develop long-term childhood friendships; being teased by peers for being neither black nor white, for having big ears, and for being skinny; and he had an elderly childhood mentor (Frank Marshall Davis) who was a communist and pedophile. (A poem written by 19-year-old Barack Obama suggests he may have been violated by Davis.) Obama predictably turned to illegal drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in his youth and remains addicted to nicotine. With this background, he could not escape being seriously psychologically damaged. From his behaviors and relationships, it is clear that he has not successfully addressed his inner deprivations.

The liberals&apos; emotional neediness leads them to identify and experience a bonding with others who also have low self-esteem and low self-love. Collectively, they long for a greater sense of self and strive to attain it by achieving equality among people using the power of an ever-growing government and irrational arguments (for equality and against freedom) that they find emotionally compelling.

       Okay, this sounds stupid-going after Target.

Liberal groups push to exploit Target backlash


 http://finance.yahoo.com/ne...-2321043209.html?x=0 

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Protesters have been rallying outside Target Corp. or its stores almost daily since the retailer angered gay rights supporters and progressives by giving money to help a conservative Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota. Liberal groups are pushing to make an example of the company, hoping its woes will deter other businesses from putting their corporate funds into elections.

A national gay rights group is negotiating with Target officials, demanding that the firm balance the scale by making comparable donations to benefit candidates it favors. Meanwhile, the controversy is threatening to complicate Target&apos;s business plans in other urban markets. Several city officials in San Francisco, one of the cities where Target hopes to expand, have begun criticizing the company.

&quot;Target is receiving criticism and frustration from their customers because they are doing something wrong, and that should serve absolutely as an example for other companies,&quot; said Ilyse Hogue, director of political advocacy for the liberal group MoveOn.org, which is pressing Target to formally renounce involvement in election campaigns.

But conservative organizations are likely to react harshly if Target makes significant concessions to the left-leaning groups.

The flap has revealed new implications of a recent Supreme Court ruling that appeared to benefit corporations by clearing the way for them to spend company funds directly in elections. Companies taking sides in political campaigns risk alienating customers who back other candidates.

Target&apos;s $150,000 donation to a business-oriented group supporting Republican Tom Emmer, an outspoken opponent of gay marriage, was one of the first big corporate contributions to become known after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out prohibitions on corporate spending in elections earlier this year.

The Minneapolis-based chain has gone from defending the donation as a business decision to apologizing and saying it would carefully review its future giving. But the protests have continued.

Demonstrators gathered near Target&apos;s Minneapolis headquarters on Thursday, and two Facebook groups focused on gay rights are organizing protests at Target stores nationwide this weekend. Immigrant rights supporters have joined the protests, citing Emmer&apos;s tough stance on illegal immigration.

The company is in talks with the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights organization that wants Target and electronics retailer Best Buy Co., which gave $100,000 to the same group backing Emmer, to match their donations with equal amounts to help gay-friendly candidates.

Fred Sainz, the group&apos;s vice president for communications, said he is optimistic both companies will respond to the demand. Target has long cultivated a good relationship with the gay community in Minneapolis, and its gay employees have protested the donation.

&quot;The repair has to be consistent with the harm that was done,&quot; Sainz said.

MoveOn, which had feared a heavy flow of corporate donations to groups that help conservative candidates after the Supreme Court decision, protested outside Target headquarters last week.

On the other side, conservatives have begun to rally to support Target, but in smaller numbers. A Facebook page urging &quot;Boycott Target Until They Cease Funding Anti-Gay Politics&quot; has more than 54,000 fans. A page declaring &quot;I will NOT Boycott Target for supporting a Conservative candidate&quot; has a little more than 400 fans.

A Target spokeswoman said the company had nothing to add to chief executive Gregg Steinhafel&apos;s statement of apology last week. At Richfield Minn.-based Best Buy, a spokeswoman said the company is reviewing its process for political donations and intended the Minnesota contribution to focus &quot;solely on jobs and an improved economy.&quot;

Emmer has said he views the Target giving as an exercise in free speech and wants to keep his campaign focused on economic issues.

Target and rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have been trying to expand into urban markets after years of saturating the suburbs. Just last month, Target opened its first store in Manhattan, in East Harlem.

The company has 1,700 stores in the U.S. but only 150 stores in cities, and 50 more in cities with more than 100,000 people nearby.

In San Francisco, Target got a warm reception when it originally outlined plans to open two stores. That&apos;s shifted since the Minnesota controversy erupted.

&quot;It just illustrates their disconnect, I think, from a city that they would want to establish a successful business in,&quot; said Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi. Target stores would be serving &quot;the epicenter of the LGBT rights movement.&quot;

Target and BestBuy&apos;s donations went to MN Forward, a business-focused group that has run ads supporting Emmer and his lower-taxes message. The group is staffed by former insiders from Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty&apos;s administration and has also backed a few Democratic legislators.

MN Forward has continued to collect corporate money after the backlash against Target, bringing in $110,000 through Tuesday from businesses including Holiday Cos. gas stations and Graco Inc., a maker of pumps and fluid handling equipment.

       The Livable Communities Act 

By Ed Braddy

Is the American Dream getting smaller? Are we defining down the tools of opportunity and the pleasures of prosperity?

President Obama&apos;s flippant dismissal of American exceptionalism last year stirred a lot of criticism because it suggested he did not believe the United States held a special place in the world. It also suggested America&apos;s unique history is, to the president, no big deal.

Now, with fellow travelers exercising power at all levels of government, progressives can do more than just belittle the idea of American exceptionalism. They can enact policies to make America unexceptional -- diminishing our quality of life and dampening opportunities for the next generation. Of course, progressives claim their vision is better and argue, with exquisite preening, that such changes are needed for our own good.

While cap-and-trade grabs the most attention, equally threatening is the euphemistically clever &quot;Livable Communities Act.&quot; Masked with feel-good rhetoric and lofty concepts like &quot;smart growth&quot; and &quot;sustainable development,&quot; the Livable Communities Act is top-down central planning aimed at changing where we live and work and how we travel. It will be overseen by bureaucrats in the Environmental Protection Agency, Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Transportation and implemented through local governments.

The Livable Communities Act exemplifies the progressive idea of strategic diminishment -- success is measured by the reduction of certain outcomes from today&apos;s standard. This is different from reducing outputs such as carbon emissions and pollutants, which are already declining and can be better addressed with affordable technologies rather than social engineering.

But social engineering is at the heart of the Livable Communities Act, where federal planners hope to reduce personal mobility as measured in vehicle miles traveled and shift housing patterns from single-family homes in the suburbs to small apartments in cramped central cities.

In a country as large and diverse as ours, some people will prefer the live-work-travel arrangements prescribed for in the Livable Communities Act, which is based on the Smart Growth planning doctrine. However, the vast majority of Americans in red and blue states alike have long aspired to live in suburban homes with a car in the garage.

This quintessentially middle-class version of the American Dream has long been derided by elites and environmentalists, who recast suburbs as a wasteful sprawl and liken automobile use to a destructive addiction. They want to delegitimize this land use pattern, restrict automobile use, and make suburban housing less affordable. The Livable Communities Act is thus a hammer in the progressive toolbox.

Absent from their advocacy is any acknowledgment that cars and suburbia are not just expressions of freedom, but indispensable contributors to our prosperity. For example, automobiles enable us to access more goods and services, forcing businesses to compete by offering higher quality and lower costs.

If you&apos;ve ever driven past one establishment to get a better deal at another, you&apos;ve personally benefited from mobility. When tens of thousands of people do this within a metropolitan area, they are fueling the creativity and innovation necessary in a market economy.

Automobiles also empower job-seekers to expand their employment range or widen the pool of potential employees for those willing to hire, both of which contribute to better wages and productivity.

Because the average citizen changes jobs more than ten times between the ages of 18 and 42, cars expand one&apos;s opportunity circle well beyond the range that can be achieved by foot, bike, or transit.

Economic prosperity is only one measure in which cars provide a superior service over the Livable Community Act&apos;s preferred alternatives. Every car trip results in a transaction that is important to the user, and those transactions can be recreational, educational, cultural, social, political, financial, or religious. People often accomplish multiple tasks on trips in ways that central planners simply cannot anticipate, much less accommodate with fixed routes and scheduling.

For those seeking spiritual fulfillment, how many limit their choices to the nearest church or synagogue? How many people routinely cross towns to participate in civic organizations like the Rotary or Kiwanis clubs? How many prefer working out at the all-night gym at odd hours?

Even if these examples are not important to you, these are examples of how other people pursue happiness. In a free society, only arrogant bureaucrats and progressive reformers would seek to diminish these choices.

These and similar trips -- individualized and uncoordinated -- make up the vehicle miles we travel each year. Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles between 2008 and 2009 due to the recession and a spike in oil prices, and today, VMT is down to 2005 levels. Few would argue that our quality of life has improved as a result.

Not surprisingly, those in the lowest socioeconomic status travel significantly less than middle-class drivers. The poor have what Smart Growth advocates call transportation choice, meaning they are dependent on someone else&apos;s schedule or limited to what is available within walking range of a transit hub.

Auto-mobility, by contrast, provides independence by empowering users to go where they want when they want. Walking, bicycling, and public transportation offer mobility, but only at lower levels compared to automobiles.

It is unrealistic to think central planners can retrofit cities around transit lines and bike paths to bring within range all that can be reached by automobiles, and the trade-off is diminished opportunities along with extremely high densities in crowded, stacked central cities.

Stating what we take for granted does not make one an uncritical apologist for the automobile, which still pollutes too much and results in too many fatalities each year. Yet new technologies are reducing emissions, improving performance, and increasing safety. Indeed, the future of automobiles is very promising.

Cars are mobility machines designed for decision-making at the individual and family level. They are the finest expression of personal mobility yet devised and are still evolving for even greater utility.

The threat to our mobility is but one aspect of the Livable Communities Act that deserves resistance. Property rights, private enterprise, and affordable homeownership are also threatened under this command-and-control legislation, despite the clever catchphrases that soften its message.

Defending the right of every citizen to maximize his potential and pursue happiness on his own terms makes opposition to the Livable Communities Act necessary. Our country is exceptional for the simple reason that her people do not accept diminishing returns on the American Dream.

 quote Author: Liberals are ruining lives
Chris Woodward - OneNewsNow - 8/21/2010 4:15:00 AM
A conservative author believes liberals are ruining America, and his new book explains seven ways to prove his theory.

Terence Jeffrey, author of Control Freaks: 7 Ways Liberals Plan to Ruin Your Life, shares that as he recently found himself observing the direction the country is headed, it struck him &quot;very hard that there is a real possibility that freedom could go away in this generation of Americans.&quot;

He points out that freedom in America is not a guarantee, so it is &quot;up to each and every generation of Americans to make sure we maintain those principles -- both of government and morality -- that have kept us free for more than 200 years.&quot;

Jeffrey, who is also editor-in-chief of CNSNews, explains that the seven ways liberals are ruining lives involve freedom of movement, control of retirement income and social security, healthcare, private property, freedom of speech, and &quot;most importantly, our freedom of conscience.&quot;

The conservative author recently discussed his book on the Focal Point program on American Family Radio. (See earlier story with Jeffrey: Liberals = &apos;control freaks&apos;)

 quote Liberals = &apos;control freaks&apos;
Chad Groening - OneNewsNow - 8/20/2010 6:00:00 AM
An author and editor hopes his new book will shed light on how liberals are trying to put government in control of many aspects of everyday life -- or have already succeeded in doing so.

Terence Jeffrey, editor-in-chief of CNSNews.com and editor-at-large of Human Events, says his book, Control Freaks: 7 Ways Liberals Plan to Ruin Your Life, illustrates how the liberal establishment believes it has the right to make personal decisions for all Americans and how it thinks empowering an ever-growing federal bureaucracy is the only way to ensure that kind of control.

&quot;I think if you look around into almost every aspect of American life today, liberals in government office have either already put in place a program that puts government in control or gives it inordinate influence in what we&apos;re doing, or they have a program they want to put in place that will do it,&quot; he observes. &quot;And I think this is a serious erosion of American freedom.&quot;

Jeffrey points out that liberals want to shirk the constitutional responsibility that the federal government does have -- providing national security.

&quot;What we have now is a government that doesn&apos;t want to do its core constitutional functions like secure the border and enforce the immigration laws, which they were expressly chartered to do,&quot; he laments. &quot;But they do want to do all kinds of things like force us to buy health insurance that they dictate, [which] they don&apos;t have the constitutional authority to do.&quot;

The author concludes that America is at a tipping point where pioneering, self-reliant citizens must resist the federal government as it attempts to turn the country into what he calls &quot;a welfare-driven nanny state.&quot;

       The lying, scheming and completely dishonest left...

 Globalist Soros Launches Frontal Assault Against Tea Party 

Soros and the foundation left have launched a website designed to go after the growing Tea Party movement. Teapartytracker.org will post video interviews and blog entries gathered by folks on the false left who never grow weary of demonstrating their outrage over the very idea of a grassroots political effort overthrowing establishment Democrats and Republicans in the district of corporate criminals.

Teapartytracker.org will be sponsored by the NAACP, Think Progress, New Left Media and Media Matters for America. Think Progress is a George Soros operation connected to John Podesta’s Center for American Progress. Podesta is Clinton’s former chief of staff. Media Matters for America is the brainchild of a MoveOn consultant and Podesta’s Center for American Progress. Soros is a major supporter of MoveOn.

On July 13, the NAACP unanimously passed a resolution repudiating the Tea Party for alleged racism. The resolution followed accusations that the Tea Party had accosted members the Congressional Black Caucus as they traipsed the district of criminals mall on their way to vote for Obamacare, a grand larceny scam cooked up by large corporations. “Civil rights icon John Lewis was spit on, while Congressman Emanuel Cleaver was called the ‘N’ word and openly gay Congressman Barney Frank was called an ugly anti-gay slur,” a press released issued by the NAACP claims.

On April 1, Infowars.com provided evidence that protesters in fact did not spit on Missouri Democrat Emanuel Cleaver or did they hurl racial epithets at members of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Cleaver later said a Tea Party protester did not spit on him intentionally. “All I’m saying is we all have to defuse it, and I think it is not in my best interest or in the best interest of this nation to stoke it,” he said on March 30 during a Fox News interview.

The NAACP and the Soros-funded anti-Tea Party operation, however, do not share Cleaver’s desire to defuse the situation. Instead, they plan to extract as much political mileage from the fictitious incident as possible.

In July, Soros’ Think Progress stitched together a video purporting to show that the Tea Party is chock full of racists.

Recall “Crash the Tea Party,” an effort exposed earlier this year, designed to portray the Tea Party as racists and reactionary throwbacks. Tea Party hating liberals “couldn’t sell the transparently nonsensical idea that Tea Partiers are just a bunch of racists, homophobes and morons, so the Crash the Party agents on the Left are infiltrating the Tea Party in order to pose as a bunch of racists, homophobes and morons,” Mark Tapscott wrote for the Washington Examiner on April 11, 2010.
In addition to so-called liberals attempting to discredit the Tea Party movement, a gaggle of anarchists also announced an effort to disrupt rallies in April.
According to Infoshop News, an anarchist website and forum, the Tea Party movement is “a coalition of conservatives, anti-Semites, fascists, libertarians, racists, constitutionalists, militia men, gun freaks, homophobes, Ron Paul supporters, Alex Jones conspiracy types and American flag wavers,” and because of this mischaracterization they should have their right to protest against the government disrupted.

Considering the above, how do we know Soros’ operatives will not infiltrate Tea Party rallies and demonstrations with actors pretending to be racists and closet KKK members and then pass this off as evidence that the movement is rife with white supremacists?

Of course, we have no way of knowing for sure, not that we shouldn’t expect Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann over at MSNBC — a network that owes its very existence to the eugenicist Bill Gates and the death merchant General Electric – to show journalistic objectivity and not feature whatever cobbled together and staged propaganda produced by the well-paid minions of George Soros.

       The Left Keeps Losing Everywhere 

By Bruce Walker

Many conservatives look at their first chance to defeat the left in six years when nervous Democrats try to explain away Obama&apos;s disastrous leftward lurch. Not only is the left looking at a big defeat in America in two months, but it has been getting slobber-knocked all over the modern industrialized world.

Five months ago, in the British General Election, the Labour Party, which had been in power since the early 1990s, suffered a devastating defeat, losing 91 seats in the House of Commons. Although David Cameron&apos;s Conservative Party had to form a coalition with the yuppie-ish Liberal Party, Conservatives are still the senior party in this government, and Cameron resonates well with British voters.

Last September, Angela Merkel&apos;s Christian Democrat Party soundly trounced the Social Democrats, and the Christian Democrats&apos; traditional coalition ally, the Free Democrats, gained enough support so that Merkel could end the &quot;grand coalition&quot; of her center-right party with the socialist SDP and form a more natural governing alliance with the Free Democrats.

In October 2008, shortly before Obama would win the White House, the Conservative Party in Canada substantially increased its strength in the Canadian Parliament. Stephen Harper almost gained enough votes to govern outright with no support from any of the other major parties. The &quot;Grits,&quot; or Liberal Party, his principal ideological opponents, suffered massive losses (that party went from almost equality with the Conservative Party to having barely half as many seats as the Conservatives).

The Italian general elections in May 2008 produced a smashing defeat for the left. The coalition of parties on the right, led by Silvio Berlusconi, won a strong majority in the Chamber of Deputies and also a majority in the Senate. What was striking about this election was that Walter Veltroni, the atheist leader of the Democratic Party in Italy, was being openly touted as Europe&apos;s Barack Obama.

In May of 2007, Nicholas Sarkozy defeated the Socialist Royale handily, putting the most pro-American and least leftist president that France has had, maybe in the history of the Fourth Republic. National legislative elections (less important in France than in other nations) also produced a solid defeat of the left in France.

General elections over the last four years -- except for in America -- have been a long ragged retreat for parties of the left in Germany, France, Italy, and Canada. Now it seems like Australia may join that company of nations. Political party names in other democracies sometimes do not convey what the parties would represent in America. The Liberal Party in Australia, for example, would be our Republican Party.

Julia Gillard, the current Prime Minister of Australia, led her left-of-center Labor Party in the August 21, 2010 general election. Gillard led it, to be more exact, into one of the lowest points in its 119-year history. As of this moment, we do not know if Gillard will be able to cobble together out of a handful of independent members of the House of Representatives -- the three independents have announced that they will make their position known by September 6 -- but her minority government, if she pulls it off, will be one of the weakest in Australian political history. The three independents are fairly conservative and used to belong to the major conservative party. Gillard&apos;s Labor Party not only did worse than in prior elections, but they did worse than polls had predicted.

The left, it seems, is everywhere finding itself very unpopular. The leaders of the left seem tired and uninspiring. If Walter Veltroni, Gordon Brown, and Julia Gillard are the best that the left has to offer voters in major democracies, then the left is in big trouble. But that does not mean that conservatives are winning. It is also vital to remember that &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; in other countries should all be shifted a little portside in our frame of reference: a strong conservative in Australia or Italy would be a RINO in America.

But the de-legitimization of the left and its separation from governance are one half of a vital victory for freedom, and that half of the war is being won. What conservatives need now is a resonant message that inspires confidence and brings hope to a global electorate increasingly frustrated with politics as usual. The other half of victory -- conservative leaders like Reagan and Thatcher and armies of conservative foot soldiers who will follow those leaders -- is still unfinished business.

The collapse of the left makes November 2010 doubly important for conservatives. If Marco Rubio wins in Florida, can he lead us to complete victory in two years? How about Michele Bachmann, who wins elections in the same state which elected Al Franken? Eric Cantor, an articulate and conservative Orthodox Jew, might carry our banner in two years. Or perhaps Senator Fiorina, if she can beat Ms. Boxer in big left California, can carry our ideals to the White House.

No one, much, believes in the tall tales of the left anymore. We do not need to convince them that monstrosities like ObamaCare are a bad idea. We need to enter the political battles with something worth fighting for and worth winning for America. That is our challenge, and we better not fail.

       Absolutely incredible. The left is like a football team with ONE offensive play. All they have is throwing insults. That&apos;s it. ONE play. And they keep doing it, even though it&apos;s not working. What&apos;s the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. NOW who is really insane?

 ‘INSANE’: ANTI-TEA PARTY AD PLAYS IN TIMES SQUARE 

NEW YORK (AP) — A California consumer-advocacy group has launched an ad on a Times Square video screen aimed at rallying the left before the November elections and labeling the tea party movement as “insane.”

The 30-second spot by Consumer Watchdog flashes phrases such as “home foreclosures” and “Wall Street greed” across a 520-square-foot screen as flames burn in the background.

It asks viewers, “Are you mad as hell but think the tea party is insane?”

Jamie Court, president of the Santa Monica-based group, says the nonprofit wants to provide voters with an alternative to the tea party and help channel their frustration in productive ways.

Calls and e-mails to a leading national tea party figure in California were not immediately returned.

Consumer Watchdog is best known for its lawsuits against the insurance industry.

       It&apos;s awfully easy to make lofty suggestions about society when writing your music from an ivory tower...

 What John Lennon Failed to Imagine 

It&apos;s a landmark event for Beatledom. John Lennon, dead these thirty years, would have turned seventy years old today.
For many &apos;60s survivors who grew up in thrall of the Fab Four, the idea that such an important symbol of the youth culture has arrived at the threshold of old age (if such a category still exists in our teen-obsessed culture) must be profoundly unsettling.
It is as if that entire generation had finally found itself washed up on the very doorstep of senility.
There can be no doubt that Lennon, in his partnership with the brilliant tunesmith Paul McCartney, did craft some of the most memorable pop tunes of the 20th century. That might be reason enough to celebrate his life. But Lennon&apos;s failure to complete his life&apos;s journey has frozen his memory in perpetual mid-life. There he presides as the guru of peace and love, an unfazed and unrepentant hippie whose vision for world peace remains unfettered by reality or subsequent historical events.
Forgotten, or perhaps conveniently overlooked, is that Lennon&apos;s solo work in his ten post-Beatles years was far inferior to anything he did as a member of the group. It was weak even by comparison to the output of his fellow Beatles (and yes, I include Ringo Starr in that assessment). His coda, the cloying and maudlin &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; (1980) was an embarrassment for such a great talent, and perhaps evidence that his muse had permanently fled.
Part of this can be attributed to Lennon&apos;s early &apos;70s determination to make political statements rather than music. Moving permanently to New York City in 1970, he and his wife Yoko Ono became lightening rods for radicals and far-left causes. Feminists, Black Panthers, Yippies, and peace movement activists all pitched their tents under the Lennon/Ono carapace to propagate their liberation politics. The recorded product of this eclectic jamboree, Sometime In New York City (1972), is a rather tuneless and bleak attempt to capture the radical zeitgeist. It bombed and is regarded universally as one of the worst post-breakup efforts by any of the Beatles.
While Lennon&apos;s post-Beatles recordings, save for the very early ones, can be largely dismissed, what can&apos;t be dismissed is his cultural influence. Lennon stands today as the most revered icon in the pantheon of the peace movement -- a figure of such sainted majesty that he has been practically beatified by secular humanists. This reputation balances precariously on the foundation of just one song -- the anthemic &quot;Imagine.&quot;
&quot;Imagine&quot; dredged up some half-baked Romantic notions and presented a vision of a world free of conflict. Attached to an ethereal melody, it seems to float in a sea of mysticism, painting a picture of a utopia that most Communist leaders in the 1970s would have recognized.
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...
Would Lennon have matured intellectually as he aged, ultimately recognizing that this formula for world peace -- written in a swishy mansion in the English countryside, far from the Communist despots and authoritarians who at that time imprisoned nearly half of humanity -- could not work? Would he have understood that there was something a little skewed about attempting to denude the world of religion, governments, sovereignty, and wealth?
Would he have finally understood that his adopted home, the United States, actually stood as the last best chance for humanity to preserve the liberty that had allowed him to pen such masterpieces such as &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;A Day In the Life...&quot;?
Probably not. Naïveté is one of the great privileges of the rich and famous. Insulated from the hard realities of life, our pop icons are safe and free to make ignorant guesses about the world and pose solutions that suggest more, not less, misery for its human population. Once having made such a statement of principle, it is highly unlikely that Lennon would ever have retired his &quot;Imagine&quot; philosophy. Unlike McCartney, who has revealed himself to be comparatively sensible on a number of important security issues, Lennon, socially alienated as a child and conditioned to reject convention, likely would have continued to find some gratification in oppositional politics and ideologies. It is doubtful he could ever have written a song such as &quot;Freedom,&quot; which McCartney penned in outrage following the attacks of 9/11.
But his legacy remains, and his &quot;Imagine&quot; vision continues to inspire the contemporary antiwar movement, a fact of which he would doubtless have been proud. Yet as the threat of a nuclear Iran grows and Islamic terrorism sets Western society in a state of constant alert, the notion that we can embrace those sworn to our destruction in a &quot;brotherhood of man&quot; presents as nothing more than an irresponsible failure of imagination.

       Liberal loser goes on a shooting rampage...the same kind of person who likes to accuse the Tea Party and the right of such action (which doesn&apos;t happen):

 FL School Board Shooter Posted Suicide Note Railing Against the Rich, Linking to Media Matters 

Clay Duke, the man who opened fire on a Florida school board Tuesday, posted a “last testament” on Facebook decrying the wealthy and linking to a slew of progressive sites including theprogressivemind.info and MediaMatters.org.

The chilling Facebook statement, posted under the “About Clay” section, talks about being born poor and how the rich “take turns fleecing us”:

My Testament: Some people (the government sponsored media) will say I was evil, a monster (V)… no… I was just born poor in a country where the Wealthy manipulate, use, abuse, and economically enslave 95% of the population. Rich Republicans, Rich Democrats… same-same… rich… they take turns fleecing us… our few dollars… pyramiding the wealth for themselves. The 95%… the us, in US of A, are the neo slaves of the Global South. Our Masters, the Wealthy, do, as they like to us…
In addition to the note, Duke also includes a reference to class warfare:

“There’s class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class that’s making war and we’re winning”
- Warren Buffet

And then issues a call to rise up, which seems to be from a poem titled “The Mask of Anarchy”:

Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number.
Shake your chains to earth like dew.
Which in sleep has fallen on you.
Ye are many – they are few.

Besides the writings, Duke also includes an exhaustive list of links under the quote “You want the truth? You can’t handle the truth!” The page includes a link dedicated to Wikileaks, another to a progressive 9/11 truther site, and even Media Matters:

       Now I understand the Rabid one a bit more.
The Left&apos;s Politics of Retribution
 http://www.americanthinker....ics_of_retribut.html 

   
 quote Liberal pundits have awakened from the euphoria of nearly two years of successful Democratic initiatives, and they are fuming. Barack Obama decided to side with Republicans on the issue of extending Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans in exchange for the extension of unemployment benefits in a deal consummated Thursday night.


It could have been expected that this wouldn&apos;t sit well with his base. Disproportionately taxing the wealthy is a critical plank in the ideology of the left, and the reason for that is simple. When liberals think of George Bush, they think of big business destroying society. When they think of big business destroying society, they think of rich, corporate fat cats. And as much as they would love to, they are unable to send George Bush to the poor house, so settling the score with the rich, corporate fat cats is the next best thing.


That&apos;s what it is all about: retribution. But the left can&apos;t just be forthright and say, &quot;We want to steal rich people&apos;s money to get back at them.&quot; So they use rhetorical sleight-of-hand to conceal the fact that tax increases for the rich are about vengeance.


They generally position it as a moral issue or an issue of charity. But while they spend all their time talking about how it is only &quot;right&quot; for the wealthy to pay more in taxes, they completely ignore that a handful of people in Washington deciding on a whim to take more property from a specific group is wrong.


Perhaps that is why when liberals are out pitching upper-class tax hikes, they have usually been compelled to preface their arguments with an unsolicited disclosure that it&apos;s not to punish success. Take Chuck Schumer&apos;s recent declaration: &quot;It&apos;s not that we want to punish wealthy people. We want to praise them.&quot;


Democrats want to &quot;praise&quot; successful individuals by disproportionately confiscating much more of their property? When a group of people is &quot;praised&quot; for success, they are generally given a reward, or perhaps applauded. They are not singled out, further stripped of their property, and demonized in an effort to use their possessions to provide for their anonymous neighbors&apos; well-being.


When the left defends a tax increase for the wealthy as anything other than punishment, it sounds less like the truth and more like an unintended confession of a guilty conscience. And that&apos;s probably because deep down, buried beneath their ideological disillusionment about the ends of wealth redistribution justifying the means, liberals know well that seizing an increased amount of property from individuals in one specific social class equates to discrimination and injustice.


But the collectivists who support Barack Obama overlook that logic and are furious that he compromised by endorsing the tax extensions. To them, extending unemployment benefits at the cost of letting the wealthy off without increased tax liability can be nothing more than a Pyrrhic victory. Obama&apos;s obligation to enforce the doctrine of &quot;social justice&quot; has always been twofold. Yes, one aspect is to assure the livelihood of those dependent upon the government, but the &quot;justice&quot; comes from the exacted revenge upon the rich people who have long held those dependents down.


Obama has done such an excellent job convincing his flock that rich Americans need to provide the capital for &quot;social justice&quot; that it seems to be liberals&apos; top priority. Think about the fact that within two years of office, Obama has fulfilled the long-held dream of the left to pass government-run health care. In that time frame, he has also increased the government&apos;s scope of influence beyond what many Americans thought possible and has assured more massive funding to expand social welfare programs. And he did all of this in the face of staunch popular opposition and at the expense of his own approval rating.


But because Obama was unable to stick it to Bush&apos;s buddies who avoided paying their fair share for the past ten years, Democrats suddenly find that he lacks the political backbone to do what must be done. So now, he is being crucified by his own for betraying his sworn beliefs.


But thankfully for conservatives, with a turned tide in the House and an increasingly unpopular president, it looks like we will get to enjoy watching the left continue to angrily hold their breath while waiting for the reckoning they crave.

       Oh, the unbelievable hypocrisy of the left. And perhaps stupidity? Oprah is a loyal supporter of liberal Democrats, *has* to know full well that they&apos;ve been talking about raising taxes on the rich for a couple of years now, doesn&apos;t like how much she has to pay *now*, with the lower rates...and STILL supports Democrats.

Looks like Oprah just had a Republican moment. 

Hey...Oprah...how about you wake the f*** up and smell the coffee?

 Oprah Laments Having to Pay High Taxes: My Accountants Bring Me ‘Tequila’ 

Even Oprah hates April 15.

The media queen admitted to Piers Morgan on Monday night that she laments having to pay such high taxes every year — in the form of large checks to the IRS — and the event has even become a depressing “ceremony” complete with alcoholic drinks.

The admission came after Oprah told Morgan during an interview that she signs every check for her business over $100,000. Morgan then asked, “Does it hurt you? Do you feel pain, physical pain?”

She responded: “The most pain I feel is ‑‑ and my accountants will tell you this. Every time I write a check to the IRS, it’s a ceremony. They come in ‑‑ for years they came in with wine. Now they come in with tequila”:

 

On Tuesday, Glenn Beck responded to Oprah’s comments. On his radio show, he said it was ironic that Oprah laments high taxes but yet campaigned for Barack Obama — the man who has talked about redistributing wealth and recently tried to raise taxes on those making over $250,000.

“If you really believed that social justice was achieved through the IRS, you wouldn’t come in with wine or tequila,” Beck said. “You would come in with champagne. Congratulations. Do you know how much social justice you have just provided? Congratulations. You would view it as a celebration. It would not be painful”:

       5 Pieces Of Common Liberal Rhetoric Designed To Incite Violence
 http://townhall.com/columni..._violence/page/full/ 

   
 quote Since Jared Lee Loughner went on his rampage in Tucson, we&apos;ve been treated to perfectly ridiculous liberal howling about &quot;violent rhetoric.&quot; The reason it&apos;s &quot;perfectly ridiculous&quot; is that “liberals being liberals,&quot; they&apos;ve tackled the whole debate in such a politically correct manner that it makes the debate laughable.

According to liberals, what words supposedly incite violence? Words like &quot;targeting,&quot; &quot;locked and loaded,&quot; &quot;crossfire,&quot; &quot;job killing,&quot; &quot;double barrel,&quot; etc. In other words, it&apos;s not people actually calling for violence; it&apos;s commonly used phrases -- that have long been used to describe politics -- that cause bloodshed by lathering up maniacs. Of course, only a complete moron could believe this – and, yes, if you believe this, I mean you personally are a moron.

Of course, even most liberals aren&apos;t this stupid. So, they&apos;ve latched on to this theory for two reasons. The first is sheer opportunism. They&apos;re going to ignore the countless times their side has used words like &quot;job killing&quot; and &quot;targeted&quot; and they&apos;re going to pretend that only conservatives do this. This shows they&apos;re hypocritical and have no intellectual honesty. But, that&apos;s just par for the course for the professional Left.

However, the other reason is more sinister: Liberals commonly say things that, if they really believe the words that are coming out of their mouths, would lead to political violence. Let&apos;s talk about just a few examples.

BushHitler: Calling George Bush &quot;Hitler&quot; and Republicans &quot;Nazis&quot; became such a regular occurrence that it became jejune during the Bush years. Whether it was

Sandra Bernhard saying, &quot;The real terrorist threats are George W. Bush and his band of brown-shirted thugs&quot; or

Michael Moore,&quot;The Patriot Act is the first step. &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; -- &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was written long before Hitler came to power. And if the people of Germany had done something early on to stop these early signs, when the right-wing, when the extremists such as yourself, decide that this is the way to go, if people don&apos;t speak up against this, you end up with something like they had in Germany. I don&apos;t want to get to that point.&quot;

If you could go back in time, before Hitler came to power, would it be immoral to kill him? People like Michael Moore, Sandra Bernhard and the rest of the professional Left were hoping someone would say &quot;no&quot; all during the Bush years.

The population of earth is &quot;unsustainable:&quot; At a minimum, you could go all the way back to Malthus on this argument, but liberals have become much more insistent about this crackpot argument in recent years. Just to name one example, Ted Turner has declared the species can&apos;t survive without reducing the population,

&quot;If we’re going to be here [as a species] 5,000 years from now, we’re not going to do it with seven billion people.&quot;

So, how do we terminate billions of people to make life on the planet &quot;sustainable?&quot; The left-wing support for abortion and cutting off DDT have certainly eliminated millions, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be getting the job done. Is it going to take a Twelve Monkeys style virus? Would you trust one of the environmentalist left-wingers who thinks life on this planet is unsustainable -- with one of the many extremely lethal bioweapons that are out there? Would you trust Ted Turner with one? After all, if life is “unsustainable” with the current population, billions of people have to die.

Bush invaded Iraq to get revenge for his daddy / enrich Halliburton / get their oil / lied us into war: It wasn&apos;t enough to oppose the war in Iraq. No, liberals had to accuse Bush of causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and thousands of U.S. soldiers for the most frivolous reasons imaginable.

Remember what Michael Moore said?

&quot;I want him [Bush] paraded in handcuffs outside a police house as a common criminal because I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a greater crime than taking people to war based on a lie. I&apos;ve never seen anything like Bush and his people. They truly hate our constitution, our rights and liberties. They have no shame in fighting for their corporate sponsors.&quot;

&quot;Let the people see what war is like. This isn’t an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush’s folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of mercenaries. They aren’t in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them.&quot; --Markos Moulitsas Zúniga on the four Americans who were murdered by terrorists and then had their corpses desecrated in Fallujah, Iraq.

&quot;(George Bush) betrayed this country! He played on our fears. He took America on an ill-conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops, an adventure preordained and planned before 9/11 ever took place!&quot; --Al Gore

Very few of these people actually believe what they were saying: the anti-war protests evaporated the moment there was a Democrat in office. But, what were these liberals really hoping to accomplish with their rhetoric? Were they hoping that a father who lost a son in Iraq or a soldier who saw his friends die, would pick up a sniper rifle and kill Bush for sending people to die for nothing? What would you do if a man sent your 18 year old son to die so he could make a few bucks for his friends?

The only way to save the planet is by decimating the world economy to fight global warming: So, if global warming is going to kill us all, along with the hapless polar bears, unless we do something, then what do we do? Some liberals have already suggested the next step: Criminalizing dissent. Here&apos;s

David Roberts from Grisoft,

&quot;When we&apos;ve finally gotten serious about global warming, when the impacts are really hitting us and we&apos;re in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage, we should have war crimes trials for these b*stards -- some sort of climate Nuremberg.&quot;

Here&apos;s Greenpeace on their blog this year,

The proper channels have failed. It&apos;s time for mass civil disobedience to cut off the financial oxygen from denial and skepticism.

If you&apos;re one of those who believe that this is not just necessary but also possible, speak to us. Let&apos;s talk about what that mass civil disobedience is going to look like.

If you&apos;re one of those who have spent their lives undermining progressive climate legislation, bankrolling junk science, fueling spurious debates around false solutions, and cattle-prodding democratically-elected governments into submission, then hear this:

We know who you are. We know where you live. We know where you work.

And we be many, but you be few.

So, if you doubt global warming, they want you either jailed or killed as a war criminal -- if they bother to get that far. They may just save time by showing up where you live or work, presumably with a gun, like Jared Lee Loughner.

George Bush and 9/11: He LIHOP or MIHOP: During the Bush years, we heard prominent liberal after liberal claim that the Bush Administration let 9/11 happen on purpose or made it happen on purpose. This was and still is a mainstream view on the Left. Everyone from Rosie &quot;it&apos;s the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel&quot; O&apos;Donnell to Van &quot;(Bush may have) deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen&quot; Jones believes it.

We&apos;re hunting and killing Al-Qaeda across the globe because they&apos;re responsible for 9/11. So, if the Bush Administration were really responsible for 9/11, what should we be doing to them? Yet, liberals are very comfortable with making this assertion. What&apos;s more likely to really lead to violence? Saying you&apos;re targeting someone to be defeated in an election or falsely accusing someone of murdering nearly 3,000 Americans? Which is really worse?

       All the News That’s Fit to Skip
 http://www.gopusa.com/thelo...s-thats-fit-to-skip/ 

   
 quote I really don’t have words any more to describe what goes on in Washington and how it’s reported (or not reported) by the media. There was big news yesterday as the House of Representatives voted to repeal Barack Obama’s health care law. There were also the comments by Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen who compared Republican remarks on health care to the Nazi propaganda machine. Both should be major news, but on this morning’s home pages of the major news outlets, nary a mention is made of either.

First, the vote

By a count of 245-189, the new Republican majority voted to repeal Obama’s health care legislation. As reported by Fox News, three Democrats also voted for repeal.

The Congress can do better in terms of replacing Obamacare with common-sense reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance and expand access for more Americans,” House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor took aim at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has said he won’t even take up the repeal measure in his chamber.

“I’ve got a problem with the assumption here that somehow the Senate can be a place for a legislation to go into a cul-de-sac or a dead end,” he said. “The American people deserve a full hearing. They deserve to see this legislation go to the Senate for a full vote.”

The vote marked a turning point for Congress in that it actually did something the American people wanted. At the time of its original passage, there was not a single poll in the country that showed a majority of Americans wanting the health care bill. Yet the Democrats had the numbers (and their left wing agenda), and they pushed it through anyway.

For some background as to the current mood of the American people, in the latest Rasmussen Reports poll, 55% of likely voters “favor repeal of the health care law.” Sixty percent of those surveyed “say the legislation will likely increase the federal deficit, while just 17% say it will reduce the deficit.”

Second, the comment

Remember all the comments by the media and left wingers about how heated rhetoric leads to violence? They were in an uproar about the root causes of the Tucson shootings, even without knowing any of the facts. So, given everything they said about “vitriol” and the consequences for certain statements, what do you think they think of Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN), who on Wednesday compared the GOP to Nazis. Cohen went on to say to compare GOP rhetoric with the propaganda that led to the Holocaust.
This is absolutely outrageous! For those of you who don’t know, as Fox News reminds readers that “blood libel” is “a historically and false anti-Semitic charge that Jews killed Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals.” Sarah Palin mentioned it in her speech last week and was criticized by the media. Now Cohen does the same thing, but goes way overboard in comparing this debate to the Holocaust.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Cohen’s remarks.

“No matter how strong one’s objections to any policy or to the tactics of political opponents, invoking the Holocaust and the Nazi effort to exterminate the Jewish people is offensive and has no place in a civil political discourse,” ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman said in a statement.

At least someone is stepping forward to say something!

Third, the “coverage”

As you can see, there was big news in Washington on Wednesday, right? Apparently not. The so-called main stream media doesn’t see it that way. This morning, as of the writing of this column, only Fox News had the health care vote as the lead story. CBS, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, and the New York Times all had other items to focus on.

Just click an item to see an image of that site’s home page:


ABC News
CBS News
CNN
MSNBC
New York Times

What a collection of lead stories. Unfortunately, none of the sites actually focused on what was really happening in this country. Surprising? No. Disappointing? Yes. The good news is that the American people are awake. They are paying attention. They want accountable, responsible government, regardless of what the media and the left want to give them. 
 


I wonder what excuse Reid will come up to say they don&apos;t have to vote on the repeal. If we are a true democracy they do need to vote on it. Are they afraid the voters will remember who voted against the repeal? I&apos;m sure the voters will remember no matter what they do.

       Hate-A-Rama: The Vulgar, Sexist, Racist, Homophobic Rage of the Left
 http://townhall.com/columni..._the_left/page/full/ 

   
 quote Barack Obama&apos;s new era of civility was over before it began. You wouldn&apos;t know it from reading The New York Times, watching Katie Couric or listening to the Democratic manners police. But America has been overrun by foul-mouthed, fist-clenching wildebeests.

Yes, the tea party movement is responsible -- for sending these liberal goons into an insane rage, that is. After enduring two years of false smears as sexist, racist, homophobic barbarians, it is grassroots conservatives and taxpayer advocates who have been ceaselessly subjected to rhetorical projectile vomit. It is Obama&apos;s rank-and-file &quot;community organizers&quot; on the streets fomenting the hate against their political enemies. Not the other way around.

The trendy new epithet among Big Labor organizers who&apos;ve been camping out at the Madison, Wis., Capitol building for more than a week to block GOP Gov. Scott Walker&apos;s budget reform bill: &quot;Koch whore.&quot; Classy, huh? It&apos;s a reference to the reviled Koch brothers, David and Charles, who have used their energy-industry wealth to support limited-government activism. A left-wing agitator based in Buffalo who impersonated Koch in a prank phone call this week used the slur to headline his &quot;gonzo journalism&quot; report. (If a right-leaning activist had perpetrated such a stunt, he&apos;d be labeled a radical, stalking fraudster. But that&apos;s par for the media&apos;s double-standards course.)

The 20-minute phone call undermined the grand Koch conspiracy by exposing that Walker didn&apos;t know Koch at all. No matter. &quot;Koch whore&quot; is the new &quot;Halliburton whore.&quot; The Captains of Civility are sticking to it. And the sanctimonious &quot;No Labels&quot; crowd is missing in action -- just like Wisconsin&apos;s Fleebagger Democrats.

Sexual vulgarity is a common theme in the left&apos;s self-styled &quot;solidarity&quot; movement. Among the Madison pro-union signs the national media chose not to show you: &quot;Buttholes for Billionaires&quot; (complete with a photo of Walker&apos;s head placed in the middle of a graphic photo of someone&apos;s posterior) and &quot;If teabaggers are as hot as their Fox News anchors, then I&apos;m here for the gang bang!!!&quot;

Last month, GOP Lieutenant Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was subjected to similar misogyny for her outreach efforts to private businesses. Liberal WTDY radio host John &quot;Sly&quot; Sylvester accused her of performing &quot;fellatio on all the talk-show hosts in Milwaukee&quot; and sneered that she had &quot;pulled a train&quot; (a crude phrase for group sex).

At an AFSCME rally in Providence, R.I., on Tuesday, an unhinged pro-union supporter picked an unprovoked fight with a citizen journalist taping the event for public access TV. His eyes bulging, the brawler yelled: &quot;I&apos;ll f**k you in the a**, you faggot!&quot; After several unsuccessful minutes of trying to calm their furious ally down, the solidarity mob finally started chanting, &quot;Hey, hey, ho, ho, union-busting&apos;s got to go&quot; to drown out his intimidating vow to follow the cameraman outside the building. Criminal charges are now pending against him. None of the local media who covered the event thought to mention the disruption in their coverage.

In Columbus, Ohio, supporters of GOP Gov. John Kasich&apos;s fiscal reforms were confronted with a fulminating union demonstrator who railed: &quot;The tea party is a bunch of d**k-sucking corporate butt-lickers who want to crush the working people of this country.&quot;

In Denver, Colo., Leland Robinson, a gay black tea party activist and entrepreneur who criticized teachers unions at a Capitol rally, was told by white labor supporters to &quot;get behind that fence where you belong.&quot; They called the 52-year-old limousine driver &quot;son&quot; and subjected him to this ugly, racially charged taunt: &quot;Do you have any children? That you claim?&quot;

Tea party favorite and former Godfather&apos;s Pizza President Herman Cain is another outspoken black conservative businessman who has earned the civility mob&apos;s lash. Two weeks ago, a cowardly liberal writer derided Cain as a &quot;monkey in the window,&quot; a &quot;garbage pail kid&quot; and a &quot;minstrel&quot; who performs for his &quot;masters.&quot; Monkey. Parrot. Puppet. Lawn jockey. Uncle Tom. Aunt Thomasina. Oreo. Coconut. Banana. We minority conservatives have heard it all.

In Washington, D.C., a multi-union protest at the offices of conservative activist group FreedomWorks resulted in one young female employee, Tabitha Hale, getting smacked with a sign by a barbarian wearing a Communications Workers of America T-shirt -- and another FreedomWorks employee getting yelled at as a &quot;bad Jew&quot; for opposing public union monopolies and reckless spending.

In the wake of the Tucson massacre, Obama urged the nation &quot;to do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children&apos;s expectations.&quot; He pushed for &quot;a more civil and honest public discourse.&quot;

As Big Labor-backing MoveOn.org (the same outfit that smeared Gen. David Petraeus as a traitor) prepares to march on all 50 state Capitols this weekend, where&apos;s the Civility Chief now? AWOL.

       More Violent Rhetoric on the Left Ignored
 http://thenewamerican.com/i...-on-the-left-ignored 

   
 quote Perhaps the mainstream media was a bit too busy searching for violence within the Tea Party movement to notice that a Massachusetts Democrat said Tuesday it was time for the Wisconsin protesters to “get a little bloody.”

The Hill reports, “Representative Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) fired up a group of union members in Boston with a speech urging them to work down in the trenches to fend off limits to workers’ rights like those proposed in Wisconsin.”

In his address to Boston union members, Capuano remarked, “This is going to be a struggle at least for the next two years. Let’s be serious about this. They’re not going to back down and we’re not going to back down. This is a struggle for the hearts and minds of America.”

He added, “I’m proud to be here with people who understand that it’s more than just sending an email to get you going. Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary.”

In a climate like that seen in Wisconsin, such rhetoric is particularly inflammatory, as anger has flared over proposed labor reforms introduced by Governor Scott Walker. The Wisconsin state legislature was naturally disconcerted by the statements made by Capuano.

“We take security seriously, whether its for me, the lieutenant governor and all 132 members of the state legislature

The very next day, Capuano issued a half-hearted apology: “I strongly believe in standing up for worker rights and my passion for preserving those rights may have gotten the best of me yesterday in an unscripted speech. I wish I had used different language to express my passion and I regret my choice of words.”

As a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus with clear ties to the Democratic Socialists of America — the same group that has adopted a number of violent, blood, revolutionary songs like The Fist and the Rose and John Lennon’s Imagine — Capuano’s passions and violent rhetoric appear to be directly in line with those with whom he surrounds himself.

After all, the Democratic Socialists of America have no qualms about admitting to their efforts to achieve socialism in the United States, or even Communism for that matter. In an introductory pamphlet to the Democratic Socialists of America, the group outlines its various beliefs, revealing a propensity for socialism and communism. For instance, the pamphlet indicates, “We believe that the workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own and control them.” Likewise, “The fall of Communism should not blind us to injustices at home. We cannot allow all radicalism to be dismissed as ‘Communist.’”

Of course, the irony of Representative Capuano’s violent assertions is that it was the Democratic Party that proposed a ban on “threatening symbols or language” as an overreaction to the Tucson, Arizona, shooting. And yet here is a Democrat who not only made a violent innuendo, but whose statement was ignored by the hypersensitive media and Left.

Then again, this is not the first time that violence or violent rhetoric on the Left has been forgiven or overlooked.

For example, SEIU has adopted a violent new theme song for the Wisconsin protests. The lyrics of the theme song, performed by the rock band Dropkick Murphys, are as follows:

When the boss comes callin’ will you stand and fight? When the boss comes callin’ we must unite, when the boss comes callin’ we can’t let them win, when the boss comes callin’ don’t believe their lies when the boss comes callin’ he’ll take his toll, when the boss comes callin’ don’t you sell your soul, when the boss comes callin’ we gotta organize, let ‘em know, we gotta take the bastards down, let them know we gotta smash them to the ground, let ‘em know we gotta take the bastards down.

Imagine the public outcry if the Tea Party movement adopted such a song for its theme.

Likewise, when SEIU thugs mercilessly beat black conservative Tea Partier Kenneth Gladney and called him the &quot;n-word,” groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) forgave the violence.

Furthermore, when Fox News conservative pundit Glenn Beck called out Frances Fox Piven for attempting to incite violence by calling on middle-class Americans to make their way to the streets in the same vein as the people of Greece, he was touted yet again as a conspiracy theorist and a fearmonger. But in what other context can one take the following statements made by Piven?

In December, Piven wrote a piece for The Nation wherein she encourages the unemployed to embrace their anger:

So where are the angry crowds, the demonstrations, sit-ins and unruly mobs? After all, the injustice is apparent. Working people are losing their homes and their pensions while robber-baron CEOs report renewed profits and windfall bonuses. Shouldn’t the unemployed be on the march? Why aren’t they demanding enhanced safety net protections and big initiatives to generate jobs?

An effective movement of the unemployed will have to look something like the strikes and riots that have spread across Greece in response to the austerity measures forced on the Greek government by the European Union, or like the student protests that recently spread with lightning speed across England in response to the prospect of greatly increased school fees.

Regardless of the numerous examples of violence on the Left, most of the mainstream media and the Left continue to embrace a “move along, nothing to see here” attitude towards it and instead launch websites like TeaPartyTracker.org to scrutinize alleged racism and violence in the Tea Party movement.

Any good psychiatrist would call that a classic case of projection.

       The Entitled Party
 http://www.americanthinker...._entitled_party.html 

   
 quote President Obama and the left wing of the Democratic Party think they are entitled to win. From our narcissistic President to screaming union organizers, they are puffed up with self-righteous zeal. They must have health care to save the sick, they must shut down Louisiana oil rigs to save the planet, they must defend government unions to save the middle class.


Of course, each side thinks they are right. Being right is no excuse. You have to abide by the law, you have to abide by elections, you have to respect the courts and constitutional separation of power, or else we no longer live in a democratic country. In our democracy, no one is entitled to win. If you won&apos;t lose, you cannot have democracy.


What you have are the Wisconsin Democrat senators who are unwilling to abide by the election results that put them in a minority. What you have is Reid and Pelosi, ramming Obamacare through by breaking rules of procedure, in order to flout the 2010 election results. What you have is the Obama White House, blocking Congress&apos;s right to confirm appointees, and openly ignoring federal courts. What you have is the Justice Department announcing it will no longer defend the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act in court, as if Obama gets to decide which laws are constitutional. What you have is a Democratic Party run amok, undercutting our democracy in the service of their own power.


The complacency, nay, the vociferous support, from Democrat leaders and the legacy media for this disregard for the rule of law reminds me of the old joke about the psychiatrist. A man is sent by his family to see a shrink because he thinks he&apos;s a chicken. After months of treatment, he is still clucking. The family asks the psychiatrist if he&apos;s told his patient he is not a chicken. &quot;No,&quot; the psychiatrist admits. &quot;Why not!&quot; &quot;Because I like the eggs.&quot;


The Democrats like the eggs. They like imposing their will, whether it be ObamaCare, or the off-shore drilling moratorium, or the blockage of Wisconsin&apos;s elected government. Are they really this short-sighted? Don&apos;t they understand the damage to our democratic system by these anti-democratic precedents? Do they really want to change congressional rules so that the House and the Senate version of bills no longer have to be reconciled, as they did to jam ObamaCare through by the fiction it was a finance bill? Do they really want the Interior Department ignoring federal court orders? Do they really want state senators refusing to accept that when you lose an election, the other side gets to pass their agenda?


Obama appointed extremists for important administrative positions, controversial and even creepy people, like Van Jones, whom he knew would not get past Congressional confirmation. The checks and balances between executive and legislative branch were instituted by our founders for this exact purpose. The executive nominates but Congress must confirm -- bedrock principles of American democracy. Obama&apos;s answer: flout the law. Call his appointees &apos;czars&apos; and bypass confirmation. This is not legal and it is not democracy. Do the liberal legacy media and Obama&apos;s fellow Democrats want presidents to have this unlimited power? Do they really want to give up the safeguards of congressional confirmation by calling appointees czars?


Czars indeed.


The White House is not only ignoring elections and subverting the power of Congress, it is also willing to disobey federal courts. When the health care bill was challenged in court and the administration lost, Obama ignored the ruling of Justice Roger Vinson of the U.S. District Court in Florida. Judge Vinson declared the entire ObamaCare bill unconstitutional in a ruling that the judge stated was the equivalent of an injunction. The White House has not halted implementation. The White house has not followed normal rules to fast-track the appeal process so the Supreme Court can decide. Our White House seems entirely comfortable to show contempt of court.


In Louisiana, the administration didn&apos;t like a court ruling lifting the moratorium on off-shore drilling, so what did the Obama administration do? It ignored the court. In response, on February 2, the U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman held the Department of Interior in contempt. The Administration then adopted a go slow policy and did not issue a single permit. So on February 21, Judge Feldman ordered the Obama administration to act on five deep water drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico within 30 days, calling the delays in issuing new decisions &quot;unreasonable, unacceptable, and unjustified.&quot; We have a White House that places its anti-energy policy above the rule of law. This is unacceptable in a democracy.


Democracy is a complex system based on cultural norms and principles as much as institutions. As we see governments topple in the context of resurgent jihadi movements in the Arab world, we are keenly aware that elections alone rarely lead to democracy. George Washington was an almost unique figure in the history of the world, in that he relinquished power. Our founding fathers were political geniuses who gave us a system of checks and balances to curb misuse of power by those who govern. As Americans, we are privileged to witness the recurring, orderly transfer of power from one administration to the next, through which voters get to determine the direction of their government and correct mistakes and imbalances.


We are seeing in both the Obama White House and the Wisconsin Senate that the Democratic Party is unwilling to lose. Over and over in the past two years, we have seen a Democrat administration willing to flout the courts, flout rules and regulations, and flout the voice of the people as expressed in elections.


Disregard for the democratic limits on power is as important as the administration&apos;s fiscal irresponsibility that threatens our prosperity, as important as the explosive growth of bureaucracy that threatens our liberties.


Our democracy cannot survive if only the Republican Party cares about it. It is time for centrist Democrats to throw off the power grab by the radical wing of their party and start defending the Constitution, as they have sworn to do.

       Make Way for Mini-Labor
 http://spectator.org/archiv...e-way-for-mini-labor 

   
 quote The Democrat party is an amalgam of special interest groups -- environmentalists, trial lawyers, minorities, college professors, and labor unions, for example. All of these groups, however, are not equally crucial to the survival of the party. Far and away the most important, of course, is organized labor.

The British equivalent to our Democrat party is the Labour party. If there were truth in labeling, that would be the name of the Democrat party. Only the spelling would change.

The Democrat party has numerous reasons to be worried. Possibly the biggest is the degree to which it is dependent on organized labor for its continued success and possibly even its existence. Where would Democrats be without unions, and vice versa? As much as they trumpet the value of diversity, Democrats are dangerously under-diversified.

Only labor unions have the ability to automatically and involuntarily extract campaign funds from their members. Unions have become the equivalent to a guaranteed income for the Democrat party.

Automatic payroll deduction makes unions qualitatively different from any other Democrat support group. Republican governors are currently making great progress in rescinding automatic payroll deduction for public employees in several states.

There is little or no difference between the goals of labor unions and the Democrat party. Their political philosophies are indistinguishable. Both, for example, view people not as individuals but rather as members of groups, all of whom are to have equal incomes, regardless of effort or merit. Although both Democrats and unions would vigorously deny being socialists, both are strongly sympathetic to socialistic ideals.

Much of the most destructive legislation of the past eighty years has been the products of the unholy alliance between the Democrat party and organized labor. Besides being far and away the greatest source of campaign funds, unions have provided a dependable army of disciplined foot soldiers for the Democrat party.

Their alliance has been a major factor in the success of both. The unions rely on the Democrats to bend the rules in their favor -- being exempted from anti-trust and restraint of trade regulations, for example. Everyone else and the economy end up worse off. Unions are rarely prosecuted for widespread corruption, threats of violence, and blatant intimidation. They have been allowed to play by a different set of rules.

Democrats need unions to deliver money and votes, unions need Democrats to deliver legislation that works in their interest. As both organized labor and the Democrat party decline in power, what each can deliver for the other will diminish. Each side of the symbiotic relationship must have power and vitality in order to keep the relationship working.

If the Democrat party finds itself in the minority for an extended period of time, it will be unable to deliver the legislation. The energy necessary to propel the system will peter out. In fact, it&apos;s already begun. Democrats were unsuccessful in passing &quot;card check&quot; even when they had majorities in both the House and Senate. Unions are not happy about that.

Organized labor is 100 percent devoted to the Democrat party. Neither should be at all surprised that Republicans are now working to diminish the power of unions. It is only natural for Republicans to be seeking to weaken their opponents&apos; basic support apparatus. Someone should remind Democrats, &quot;Live by the sword, die by the sword.&quot;

Less than seven percent of private-sector workers now belong to unions. That is a number that probably scares the hell out of Democrats. Thirty-six percent of government workers are unionized. If public-sector history repeats private-sector trends, the implications are profound. As Washington Post columnist, Robert Samuelson, put it, &quot;Big Labor became Little Labor. If public-sector unions fail, Little Labor could become Mini-Labor.&quot; I would only add -- and the once powerful Democrat party will become the Mini-Democrat party. It&apos;s way too soon to know for sure, but for Democrats it could be that the party&apos;s over.

2 ex-Dem leaders charged in fake tea party scheme
 http://detnews.com/article/...ake-tea-party-scheme 

   
 quote 
Pontiac— Two former high-ranking members of the Oakland County Democratic Party are facing various election corruption charges in a bogus tea party scheme, Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper and County Sheriff Michael Bouchard announced Wednesday.

Former Democratic Party Chairman Michael McGuinness and ex-operations director Jason Bauer, both of Waterford Township, were arraigned Wednesday before Oakland Circuit Judge James Alexander.

They face charges related to Independent Tea Party filings, false affidavits and forged documents that occurred between July 23 and July 26 last year.

Both stood mute to the charges and were released on $25,000 personal bond each, pending an April 13 hearing before Alexander.

The charges include felonies that carry up to 14 years in prison. Neither could be reached for comment.

Cooper and Bouchard announced the charges during a joint press conference conducted to discuss the findings of a one-person grand jury seated by Oakland Circuit Judge Edward Sosnick.

&quot;The election process is sacred … this is not a partisan statement,&quot; Cooper said, noting her Democratic affiliation and that of Bouchard, a Republican. Bouchard said 23 questionable election filings across Michigan — eight of them in Oakland County — involved an effort to create the illusion of an Independent Tea Party and its candidates on November&apos;s ballot.

The goal was to woo away voters in local elections who might otherwise vote for other candidates, presumably Republicans, authorities allege.

While creating such a party in itself is not illegal, Bouchard noted that the alleged forging of documents and putting people up for political office without their involvement — including at least one &quot;candidate&quot; who told investigators he had no knowledge that he was on the ballot until notified — is criminal.

The scheme included bogus candidates for two County Commission seats and a state Senate race, according to a copy of a grand jury warrant released Wednesday. None of the candidates won.

&quot;The presumed intent was to get people drawn to tea party politics and siphon votes off (from other candidates),&quot; Bouchard said.

Bouchard said the investigation of possible election corruption is continuing and included an unnamed &quot;party leader in Lansing.&quot; The sheriff did not elaborate.

County Executive L. Brooks Patterson petitioned for a grand jury inquiry into possible election corruption in August following complaints received by then-County Clerk Ruth Johnson and an investigation initiated by Bouchard&apos;s office at the request of Cooper.

Both McGuinness and Bauer are charged with three counts of forged records, uttering and publishing, a 14-year felony; three counts of election law, false swearing, a felony punishable by five years in prison; and one count of election law, false swearing-perjury, also a five-year felony.

Bauer is also charged with three counts of notary public violation, a one-year misdemeanor.

Both resigned their party posts following allegations in August that suspicious filings were notarized by Bauer.

Several months ago, Bauer was suspended from the Oakland Democratic Party after it surfaced that he encouraged interns to write bogus &quot;help me&quot; letters from nonexistent residents in support of a medical program backed by a Democratic commissioner.

       Democrats&apos; Tyranny of the Minority and holding Democracy hostage.
 http://www.americanthinker....ny_of_the_minor.html 

   
 quote Talk radio kingpin Rush Limbaugh has repeated for years his belief that as a political party, the Democrats feel entitled to power. When they are denied it by the results of an election, they react as though they are the victims of a grave injustice, thereby at liberty to engage in whatever tactic is necessary to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. Beginning with the Wisconsin walkout and now embodied in the temper tantrum of Indiana Democrats, the self-professed Doctor of Democracy has once again been proven right.


Statehouse walkouts are not without precedent. In fact, they are a reasonably common occurrence. But they are largely symbolic gestures -- an attempt to demonstrate the minority&apos;s outraged disapproval of the majority&apos;s agenda. Seldom do they go on for days, and until now, never have they been legitimate attempts to undermine the entire democratic process by grinding the operation of government to a halt.


Yet that is exactly what the Wisconsin Democrats attempted, and what their Indiana counterparts are still shamefully perpetrating. What is taking place in the Indiana Statehouse is far from a mere regional or petty statewide issue; it is a direct assault on the democratic process that deserves national attention and collective, bipartisan scorn. For while the Wisconsin constitution allowed the Republicans a procedural recourse to rectify the stalemate (something they employed when it became apparent the Democrats could not be lured back by compromise), Indiana Republicans have no such option.


For those who may be unaware, Indiana Statehouse Democrats staged a walkout a month ago to deny the large Republican majority the ability to enact legislation opposed by public and private union bosses - specifically right-to-work and public education reform laws. The Democrat caucus fled across state lines to Illinois (where else?), and have been holed up in a hotel demanding concession after concession to earn their return. But even after capitulating to their juvenile fit and pulling the right-to-work law off the table, Republican leaders have been unsuccessful in luring the Democrats back to work.


Indiana House Speaker, Republican Brian Bosma, acknowledged as much when he lamented, &quot;We can&apos;t do the Madison shuffle that Wisconsin legislators were able to accomplish.&quot; The consequence of that reality? Given that Indiana has a part-time legislature, the stalemate will most likely cease only when the session adjourns and Governor Mitch Daniels calls the Assembly back into special session to pass a budget and new redistricting maps - the only items the legislature is required by law to pass. This special session may give Republicans some wiggle room, but the likelihood is that the Democrat temper-tantrum will have killed the passage of virtually every bill introduced this year.


There&apos;s a phrase for what is occurring in Indiana; it&apos;s called the &quot;tyranny of the minority.&quot; In Federalist #10, James Madison warned against the tyranny of the majority by proposing that a republican form of representative democracy would best protect the rights of the minority. What he apparently didn&apos;t count on was that in an effort to appease their union masters, the minority would one day use those protections to obliterate the democratic process. And that is precisely what is unfolding.


It&apos;s telling that the phrase &quot;tyranny of the minority&quot; has been employed in recent years by Democrat apologists angry at the Republican Party&apos;s use of the filibuster to stall Democrat-sponsored legislation. Watching Republicans require a supermajority of 60 Senators to pass some of Barack Obama&apos;s most controversial policies (thereby slowing his left-wing revolution of government), Democrat consultant Peter Fenn thundered, &quot;This is the tyranny of the minority...This acceptance of a supermajority to get anything done in America has gotten way out of hand...There is a place for a supermajority: impeachment, eviction of members, veto overrides, votes on treaties and constitutional amendments. But we should not have such requirements for the regular conduct of legislative business, especially at times like these, when action is required to move the country forward.&quot;


One must wonder where Mr. Fenn and his counterparts are now. After all, while both parties&apos; overuse of the filibuster to obstruct legislation is a fair topic of conversation, it pales in comparison to the unseemly tactic of a group of lawmakers who hold representative democracy itself hostage by refusing to show up for work. Because while a filibuster is levied to obtain critical changes and adjustments to pending legislation, these walkouts are a brazen attempt to thwart the will of the people expressed in an election.


As Bosma explained, &quot;We&apos;ve offered a number of concessions on substitutive matters on issues of concern to the Democrats. What we have not agreed to do is to meet their demand to remove issues for the remainder of the legislative session in both chambers, which is their continued demand, that these issues just go away, really nullifying the election results of November 2.&quot;


And that&apos;s why reasonable and fair minded individuals from around the country and from both sides of the aisle should be outraged at this stunt. The dangerous precedent being set here is that whatever party loses the election should just flee the state to prevent the winners from passing any laws. This un-statesmanlike chicanery annihilates the very republican form of government our Constitution guarantees.


In his article, Fenn complained, &quot;We have seen the rapid evolution of a nation that covets the concept of majority rule to one where the tyranny of the minority threatens to paralyze the country.&quot; Indeed it does. Nothing less than the democratic process is at stake. And ironically, it&apos;s the group of folks who euphemistically and now wholly inappropriately refer to themselves as the Democratic Party who have the gun to its head.

Schumer Caught Telling Senators to Smear GOP, Boehner
 http://www.newsmax.com/Insi...al&amp;promo;_code=BF9A-1 

   
 quote So much for civil discourse. Sen. Charles E. Schumer briefly revealed his true face Tuesday as reporters listened to him instruct fellow Democrats in how to paint Republicans and House Speaker John Boehner as extremist Tea Party zealots in the budget debates.

“I always use the word extreme,” Schumer told his fellow Democrats. “That is what the caucus instructed me to use this week.”

Republicans were quick to blast the remarks.

“It just lends to the fact to what we’ve always known, that this is a political game,&quot; said Rep. Allen West on Fox News. &quot;It’s about gamesmanship, it’s about maneuvering, and it really is about politics. It’s not about doing what is best for the American people, it’s not about reducing the size and scope of the federal government so we can get back to have long-term, sustainable economic and job growth. I think Charles Schumer showed his hand. Now it’s up to the American people to realize who are really the ones who are standing as an obstacle for us to move forward.”

West added that Schumer, Harry Reid, and Obama want a shutdown so that they can use it to blame Republicans, and position themselves for 2012.

The brief peek behind the curtain came as Schumer was about to start a conference call with reporters on Tuesday morning, according to The New York Times. The No. 3 Democrat in the Senate was apparently unaware that many of the reporters were already on the line when he began revealing what passes as strategic messaging for Democrats.

After thanking his colleagues — Barbara Boxer of California, Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — for doing the budget bidding for the Senate Democrats, Schumer told them to portray John A. Boehner of Ohio, the speaker of the House, as painted into a box by the Tea Party, and to decry the spending cuts that he wants as extreme.

A minute or two into the talking-points tutorial, though, someone apparently figured out that reporters were listening, and silence fell, according to the Times.

After finding their bearings, the Democrats launched right into their message.

“We are urging Mr. Boehner to abandon the extreme right wing,” said Boxer, urging the House to compromise on the scale of spending cuts and to drop proposed amendments that would deny federal financing for Planned Parenthood and for government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency.

Carper, too, hit the word “extreme,” referring to some House Republicans’ “right-wing extremist friends.” Cardin decried Boehner’s giving into “extremes of his party.” Blumenthal closed by speaking of the “relatively small extreme group of ideologues” who are “an anchor” dragging down the budget negotiation process.

No doubt Schumer will pay more attention to the mute button on his phone as the debate continues.

       The Left&apos;s Hitler Obsession
 http://www.americanthinker....itler_obsession.html 

   
 quote My childhood has long passed, but I still have a clear memory of one particular occasion when I found myself squared off against a grammar school bully -- a young misfit who roamed the playground just looking for trouble.


How the altercation began I don&apos;t recall, but it soon escalated into rounds of all-out name-calling.


My young adversary probably led off with a profound observation like, &quot;You&apos;re a stupid idiot.&quot;


&quot;You&apos;re not just stupid,&quot; I countered. &quot;You&apos;re a fool.&quot;


&quot;You&apos;re worse than a fool,&quot; he offered. &quot;You&apos;re yellow.&quot;


&quot;That&apos;s not as bad as being a rat!&quot; I replied.


&quot;Well, you&apos;re a liar,&quot; he asserted, adding a bit of questionable historical proof, &quot;just like Benedict Arnold.&quot;


I was about to point out that Arnold, as we had been informed just that morning, was a traitor, not a liar. But I thought of something better, something that would put the argument to rest and leave my adversary reeling.


&quot;Well, you&apos;re Hitler!&quot; I pronounced.


It worked. My opponent was indeed speechless. Nothing could top that accusation. This, after all, was just a few years after the flesh-and-blood Hitler had dispatched hordes of goose-stepping storm troopers all over Europe while rounding up and liquidating millions of Jews, gypsies, and Slavs. So my comparison of this playground ne&apos;er-do-well with the worst figure in human history was pretty stunning. The young villain stood silent for a few seconds, then stumbled away at a total loss for words. I was victorious on the field of battle that day. But was I fair?


For one thing, the analogy was hardly credible. It was not quite accurate to accuse my adversary of sending millions off to the concentration camps and causing a world war. Clearly, the 70-pound villain standing opposite me was not Hitler. No matter how badly he developed, he would never grow up to commit the sorts of crimes of which I was accusing him. In truth, he probably would grow up to be a kind-hearted, generous, decent member of society.


My retort was inaccurate, but it was worse. Even at that age, I realized it was something that should not have been said, and I don&apos;t recall ever saying it again.


For the rest of my life, though, I would hear it repeated by others. In fact, it became so familiar that one could expect any hard-pressed leftist to insinuate the Hitler line into his argument. The variations were endless, but they all involved the same basic analogy: anyone who is the least bit cautious or conservative is a fascist -- only leftists and anarchists are not.


I&apos;ve always found the analogy distasteful, not just because it is unfair but because it diminishes the real evil of the past. Taunting Richard Nixon with cries of &quot;fascist,&quot; as his U.S. Senate opponent Helen Douglas did in 1950, trivialized the horrific evil of actual fascism. The suggestion of a liberal blogger that the &quot;road to fascism began with Ronald Reagan&quot; was just as distasteful.


As socialistworker.org admits, the left routinely applies the term &quot;fascist&quot; to any Republican political leader. In Britain The Guardian, BBC, and other liberal media pounced on purported links between the Bush family and corporations that had dealings with Nazi Germany. The fact that Prescott Bush, George W. Bush&apos;s grandfather, was a &quot;director and shareholder&quot; with companies that had indirect financial dealings with Germany in the 1930s would hardly seem damning, however. Much the same could be said for many other affluent individuals in America or Britain at the time. Every American today with mutual fund holdings is invested, at least indirectly, in Hugo Chavez&apos;s Venezuela. Does that make them Marxist revolutionaries?


Talk of Hitler became a lot more common during the Bush years, when it was accepted wisdom on the left that George Bush was worse than Hitler. Then there was Nancy Pelosi, who spent weeks back in 2010 complaining of the Tea Party&apos;s so-called &quot;swastika signs&quot; -- signs that did not signal an alliance with fascism but opposition to it. Pelosi was hardly alone in accusing the Tea Party of fascism. Marc Rubin, writing for examiner.com, referred to Tea Party members as &quot;text book fascists.&quot; He went on to pin the neo-fascist label on Tom Tancredo, presumably because of Tancredo&apos;s concerns over illegal immigration. If those concerns make Tancredo a fascist, they would make the majority of Americans who share those concerns fascists as well. But that&apos;s pretty much how the left sees America.


The immediate response of liberals such as Chris Matthews to the Ryan &quot;Path to Prosperity&quot; was to characterize it as a killer not just of babies and old people but of &quot;half the people who watch this show.&quot; This attempt to portray the GOP plan as genocidal is just another example of the fascist rhetoric. It appears that Matthews is attempting to portray the Ryan plan as some sort of Final Solution.


It&apos;s not just loose cannons on MSNBC who resort to fascist innuendo. Obama&apos;s speechwriters are good at crafting sinister suggestions even without using the &quot;F&quot; word. Obama&apos;s budget speech of April 13 actually set the tone for the current debate. With Rep. Ryan sitting on the front row, Obama lectured his audience that the GOP plan would kick &quot;someone&apos;s grandparents&quot; out of nursing homes and cause children with autism and Down&apos;s syndrome to &quot;fend for themselves.&quot; It is well known that Hitler sent legions of the disabled to concentration camps to be gassed, but the suggestion that a plan to actually save Medicare and Medicaid resembles the Holocaust, if that is what Obama intended, is repellent. It was one more proof, as if we needed any more, of a fatal weakness in the character of this President. He is a man whose entire existence is devoted to gutter politics. For such a man, statesmanship and dignified leadership are inconceivable.


The plan truth is that America can no longer afford this sort of reckless partisanship on the part of the chief executive. The fact that Obama disagrees with Rep. Ryan&apos;s budget plan does not justify accusations of killing sick children or tossing old folks out on the street. That kind of rhetoric may pass for wit in the sixth grade, but it is juvenile coming from the President.


When is the left going to grow up, stop tossing around irresponsible charges of fascism, and discuss issues in a mature way? Not, I suppose, until they can win the argument on the facts, and that will be a long, long time.

 quote Rolling Back the Obamacare Banana Republic

A rising chorus of repeal-mongers, outraged at the Obama administration’s federal health care power grab, took over Washington this week. Nope, it’s not the tea party. It’s Democrats Against the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). Yes, Democrats.

What’s IPAB? A Beltway acronym for subverting the deliberative process.

The 15-member panel of government-appointed bureaucrats was slipped into Section 3403 of the Obamacare law against the objection of more than 100 House members on both sides of the aisle. IPAB’s experts would wield unprecedented authority over Medicare spending — and in time, over an expanding jurisdiction of private health care payment rates — behind closed doors.

Freed from the normal administrative rules process — public notice, public comment, public review — that governs every other federal commission in existence.

Without the possibility of judicial review.

And liberated from congressional oversight except through an onerous accountability procedure.

Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius touted IPAB as a “key part” of Obamacare. The president himself crusaded for giving the board even more regulatory “tools” to usurp congressional power over health care allocations. And he has the audacity to blame Republicans for creating a “banana republic”? Hmph.

The conservative Arizona-based Goldwater Institute has filed suit in federal court to stop IPAB. “No possible reading of the Constitution supports the idea of an unelected, standalone federal board that’s untouchable by both Congress and the courts,” says the think tank’s litigation director, Clint Bolick. But it’s the growing opposition from members of the administration’s own party that may yet doom these health care czars on steroids.

But look who’s not biting: According to Politico, “New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, of the Energy and Commerce health subcommittee, has zero interest in defending the board. ‘I’ve never supported it, and I would certainly be in favor of abolishing it.’” If that’s not clear enough, Pallone added that he’s “opposed to independent commissions or outside groups playing a role other than on a recommendatory basis.” Period.

Another House Democrat, Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania, is one of seven Democratic IPAB repeal co-sponsors and is scheduled to testify Wednesday at a second House hearing blasting the board. And former Democratic House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt channeled the tea party in a recent op-ed when he decried IPAB as “an unelected and unaccountable group whose sole charge is to reduce Medicare spending based on an arbitrary target growth rate.”

IPAB defenders demand an alternative, but that’s why the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission already exists. And for those unsatisfied with its woeful results, there’s the demonized GOP/Rep. Paul Ryan reform package that relies on individual choice and competition over bureaucratic diktats to reduce spiraling Medicare costs.

Opponents of GOP structural reforms have now resorted to decrying Ryan’s choice of beverages as a way to discredit the plan. An apparently besotted Rutgers University economist and former Kerry/Edwards economic adviser, Susan Feinberg, accosted Ryan at a D.C. restaurant last week while he was dining with two financial experts over a pricy bottle of wine. “I wasn’t drunk, but I was certainly emboldened to speak my mind,” Feinberg told liberal blog Talking Points Memo. She gleefully described attacking Ryan for espousing government austerity while — gasp — dining out on his own dime.

It’s the same unhinged and irrational sanctimony that has New York Times columnist David Brooks assailing entitlement reformers as moral degenerates; the Washington Post’s Richard Cohen likening them to Jonestown cult killer Jim Jones; and Daily Beast editor Tina Brown decrying them as “suicide bombers.” Ah, the days of whine and bozos.

The good news: Thanks to sober bipartisan criticism (Where are all the cheerleaders for bipartisanship when you need them?), Sebelius and company are now downplaying IPAB as a harmless “backstop mechanism” with limited powers to do anything at all to control costs. At a House hearing Tuesday, Sebelius tried to paint the board as just another run-of-the-mill dog-and-pony panel that would be “irrelevant” if Congress so chooses

It’s not quite an under-the-bus moment, but it’s certainly a nudge toward rolling back the Obamacare Republic.

 http://thenewamerican.com/o...olitical-lie-of-2011 

   
 quote What is the biggest political lie of 2011? There are so many to choose from. I admit I was skeptical when PolitiFact said it was ready to declare the “Lie of the Year 2011.” After all, its record for bashing conservatives was pretty much unblemished.

Two years ago, the scribes who put together PolitiFact selected Sarah Palin’s comment about “death panels” as the biggest lie of 2009. In 2010, they once again sprang to the defense of Obamacare, pooh-poohing claims that it represented a “government takeover of health care” as the year’s biggest falsehood.

So imagine my surprise when the PolitiFact declared that the “Lie of the Year 2011” was the Democrats’ claim that “Republicans voted to end Medicare.”

       Burning Our Constitution for More Power
 http://patriotupdate.com/ar...ution-for-more-power 

   
 quote I have a question that is burning a hole in my mind, but it did not start out that way. Ever since President Obama, or whoever he really is, has been in office, there has been a question starting to form in my thoughts. As time goes along and I see what Obama is doing while in office, this question has been becoming more focused and clearer each day. Before I ask the burning question, I want to first explain a few things so the question comes out correctly. At the very beginning of Obama’s presidency, there was a small bit of optimism, even though I did not vote for him. The rationale I had at the time was maybe he could pull Americans together to accomplish something wonderful. I realize now this was very naive of me; because of Obama’s actions, I have come to realize there is one question which is now plaguing me. No longer can I just sit back and wait to see what happens to America because the destruction of our Nation has begun under the leadership of President Obama.

The question in my mind is based upon people who are trying to achieve power; that is to say, they are seeking to obtain power-filled positions so they can either get money, gain control over others or both. Everyone wants to control their own destiny in life, but people who are power-crazy, not only want to control their own life, they want to control everyone else’s life as well. They want us to embrace homosexual rituals in public and are forcing public schools to teach their immoral acts which is against God and Natural Law. I say if we all lived our life as gay people, there would not be any human life around because no one would have any children. So here we have this minority group who wants to gain power over our lives. The way they are getting power is to force public educational systems to embrace and promote their immoral ineptitude by teaching our young children that this behavior is OK and acceptable. Who are they to teach my children immoral behaviors?

There are those who just do not believe in the existence of any type of higher intelligence, such as God, because in their mind, no one is smarter than ‘they’ are and if they cannot see God, then God does not exist. Our planet has been around about 3.5 billion years and most of that time, life was hanging on by only small degrees. In comparison, our universe is about 14 billion years old. This is a huge amount of time where it is easy to imagine entire civilizations have come and gone; I wonder more and more how long America will last? Life is really prevalent here on our planet and if we look deeply we see life all over. If we could see far enough out, we would probably see life elsewhere as well. To say all things in the universe have only occurred by happenstance seems really, really lucky. We know that as we experience life for ourselves that luck does not play out very well; how lucky are we really? We are not very lucky because President Obama is destroying our Nation; oh, what luck our generation is having! Just outside of our human intellect, just at the edge of our perception, there is a superior existence which we can label as God. It just does not seem logical that complex life which has occurred in this universe did so without intervention from God. Just because some people cannot believe God exists, does not mean it is not true. So why should a minority of Nay-Sayers be able to dictate to the majority that we cannot openly embrace and pursue our love, respect and loyalty to our God? Just because they do not believe, why do we have to be taken all the way down to their pathetic level? In public schools, teachers are mandated to teach children about homosexual activities, but these same teachers cannot where a cross or crucifix around their neck, much less talk about God; unless they are Muslim.

What really has gotten me thinking is how there are power-crazed people who live their life in the USA but actively embrace the teachings of radicals and anarchists. These power-crazed people were born into a governmental system that allowed them the opportunity to live life and experience it as free people, but they now actively “sell” anarchy to others. Anarchy is something they never lived but they want others to embrace it. How do they know anarchy is better than freedom? They are only trying to gain power and they use anarchy as the mechanism to create power for their self interests. Their fictional anarchy is only to make people mad at something so they can become their leader of these mad people, thus giving them the power they are seeking. Once a person gets mad, they get a feeling of empowerment and being mad is the oldest trick Satan has because it gets people to do irrational actions; thus when a person is acting mad, Satan is actually in control. There is a fundamental problem with being mad because it cannot be maintained all the time without a constant irritant and stimulus. Eventually, a person will cool off without this constant stimulus and common sense will return. Anarchists have to keep things stirred up and will keep the fire lit over and over again. They have to keep the level of anger high so they can stay in power. Just know whatever it is that anarchists are selling does not have to be true, it just has to make people mad.

By now you are probably asking what question is burning a hole in my mind. The reason I mentioned these three types of scenarios is because they have one thing in common. Can you guess what they have in common? Let me say all of these are supported and embraced by the Democratic Party. In fact, there is a lot more the Democratic Party embraces but now is not the time to explain all of them in detail. What is important to know for this article is the people within the Democratic Party have aligned themselves, or have allowed their party to become a political party who stands against everything we have established as “American.” Many years ago the Democratic Party was a ‘Party of honor’ which had as their agenda ‘compassion for helping those who cannot help themselves.’ What the Democratic Party has become today is altogether far different from what they use to be. Today, they are all about changing the United States into a Socialistic Islamic Nation.

What is burning a hole in my mind is this: “How can Democratic Politicians and people who support the Democratic Party, those who embrace their own freedom, live their life as free citizens in the US and whose children and grandchildren will inherit what they leave behind, how can they be selling-out our Nation?” Yes, I mean the Democratic Party is selling us out to radicals, Muslims, homosexuals and anti-religious groups who want to destroy and take America down! I find it very troubling there are actually “Americans” who are trying to destroy our own country from within. How can someone who loves the freedom they have, be voting into law a socialistic healthcare program that gives the Federal Government control of their healthcare and where this same government infringes upon everyone’s freedom and life? How can these people who say they ‘love America’ be stomping upon our Constitutional underpinnings knowing their own blood will be living a life worse off than they ever had to live? How can these Democratic Party idiots succumb to all the minorities in such a fashion where it leads to a massive national debt, maintain poor job growth and takes away our freedom? How can these people, who are supposed to be protecting us, be selling-out America?

Most of them crave power over others and they believe they do not have to comply with these crazy laws they are passing. Then there are other people who hold something over their heads to get them to vote the way they want them to vote. In short, some politicians are told what to do, if they do not comply, something they did will be broadcasted and would cause them harm. In fact, some of the ruthless power-hungry politicians actually setup others for corruption so they can get dirty laundry on them. That way, they have power over them and this will cause them to support laws that are against our foundation as a Nation. People who desire power over others will do any and all they can to get power and there is no logic behind what they will and will not do in order to achieve this goal. This is why newly elected officials to Washington DC will eventually start voting for crazy laws because somewhere, sometime, they have done something wrong, that if exposed, would cause them harm or embarrassment. These things are setup and done on a regular basis by those with lots of money and uber-power. They will find people who will manipulate others to do their bidding. There is a saying “There is no honor amongst thieves.” Washington DC is not corrupt; it is the people who are power hungry that are corrupt. They are the ones who are evil and are leading our Nation into turmoil and ruin.

Since we have a non-American as President, it has become very clear that the Nation which we were born into, the Country we grew up in and the Land we cherish in our hearts will not be what we pass down to our children. It will be far, far different than anything we can imagine. Because of democratic compassion, the Democratic Party has succumbed to those who do not hold the same standards and values as the majority of Americans hold. These corrupt politicians will do any and everything they can to stay in power and this means they will lie, cheat and steal votes during an election. The will do anything they can to take power if it is not given to them. Power is what they are after and the more power they get, the more power they want to have. They will try to get so much power, that it will set our US Constitution and Bill of Rights on fire! They have no concern for our Laws unless it is for their enemies to follow. For them, they are exempt from following their putrid laws and so they are immune. They will cause people to get mad and will make them focus that anger in ways to benefit their own power crazed desire. Their power is insatiable and they really do not care one iota for those whom they hurt. All they want is to get their way and if they do not, they are the loudest of the loud at screaming foul!

So what can we do? If we sit back and act scared to do anything, then we will lose more than our Nation. Right now I can just hear my brother-in-law saying “It is not that bad.” This is because he does not have the time nor does he have the desire to gain the knowledge he needs to make an informed decision. I wonder how he will feel in the future if Obama is re-elected and we lose the American Dollar as the Worlds Money Standard. How will he feel if we get Obamacare forced down our throats and when he is nearing the age of 80 and they tell him “Sorry, you are just too old for us to do anything for you… we are pulling the plug because you cost too much.” I wonder if he would be able to put two and two together and say, well, I should have voted for someone who did not sell-out America.

I am afraid there are very many people in America today just like my bother-in-law who will probably not be able to associate the damage that will happen to America if Obama is re-elected into office another four years!

WE MUST VOTE OUT OF OFFICE ALL DEMOCRATIC PARTY POLITICIANS!

THEY DO NOT HAVE AMERICA’S BEST INTEREST IN THEIR HEARTS OR MINDS!

WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO DO TO KEEP AMERICA AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS?

PELOSI: FOOD STAMP PRESIDENT &apos;BADGE OF HONOR&apos;
 http://www.breitbart.com/Br...eople-On-Food-Stamps 

   
 quote Speaking at Jesse Jackson&apos;s Rainbow Push Coalition, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi addressed recent comments by Newt Ginginch referring to Obama as the &quot;Food Stamp President&quot; because more Americans have fallen into poverty and had to seek government assistance. According to Ms. Pelosi, this was a &quot;Badge of Honor&quot;

       The Sleeping Giant Awakens 

By Robin of Berkeley

One of my closest friends, &quot;Gail,&quot; lives in a pristine suburb in northern New Jersey. It&apos;s one of those leafy bedroom communities where residents drive their Lexus SUVs to the railroad station each morning to catch the train to Manhattan.
After 9/11, Gail told me that eerily, several vehicles were left abandoned in the parking lot for weeks. Their drivers never returned home that day to retrieve them.
But, in general, not much goes on in her sleepy, idyllic town. The residents rave about shopping sprees to Loehmanns and sprints to Whole Foods for organic strawberries. There is no crime to speak of; the local paper blares news about a recent traffic accident or the opening of a Trader Joe&apos;s. So when Gail told me what happened to her son, I was absolutely dumbfounded.
As for Gail, like my former self, she&apos;s a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party. This isn&apos;t surprising given that she&apos;s a born-and-raised East Coast Jew. But, unlike the former me, Gail is a liberal, not a self-proclaimed progressive/leftist.
While many conservatives merge liberalism and leftism, there are huge differences between the two camps. Liberals, like Gail, want a kinder and gentler America. They choose safe, suburban suburbs, with schools that (as of yet) do not radicalize their children. While it&apos;s the rare liberal who would display a flag on July 4, he still cares about this country, supports Israel, and is wary of radical Islam.
The progressive/leftists are an entirely different species entirely; they do not love this country or Israel. In fact, the far left would like nothing better than to knock the US and Israel down from their high horses.
Leftists sympathize with the &quot;victims&quot; of the United States, not those Americans who are brutalized by thugs or terrorists. The left practices third-worldism, the belief that the paths of Chavez and Lenin are vastly superior to our own Founding Fathers. Having become smitten by the renegade image of Che Guevara, they fashion themselves as post-modern revolutionaries, who set out, with a missionary zeal, to change the world.
Consequently, leftists turn a blind eye to the savagery of the third world, e.g. the burqua or beheadings. Progressives justify the brutality of gang violence and perhaps engage in mob behavior themselves. While they label conservatives as reactionary, leftists are, in truth, the true reactionaries, reacting against Mommy, Daddy, God, and country.
Like me, my liberal friend, Gail, voted for Hillary Clinton during the primary. Gale was pleased with the prospect of a female president and nostalgia for the &quot;good old days&quot; of husband, Bill. After Hillary lost, Gail was a Good Democrat, and chose Obama instead.
She voted for him, even though I tried and tried in vain to wake her up to the truth. I myself voted for Hillary until the ascent of Obama snapped me out of my lifetime progressive trance.
I saw that something was terribly wrong, that people were acting crazy around him. The multitudes were entranced, hypnotized, in a cult-like way. Even more disturbingly, the more emotionally unstable supporters were behaving violently towards any and all opponents. And Obama, taking in the whole scene, said nothing.
The smearing of the opposition, the misogyny directed at Hillary and Sarah, the cloud of aggression that followed Obama around, like the grime that trailed after the cartoon character Pigpen, felt frightening to me, menacing, and creepy. It finally dawned on me that should Obama be elected, the dark and uncivilized behavior that I see in Berkeley would spread and multiply and envelope the entire country.
I tried my best to explain all of this to Gail; I pleaded with her to reconsider her automatic pilot vote for Obama. I pulled out all of the stops: I explained in painstaking detail what life was like in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco under the radicals. I told her about walking a gauntlet of paranoid, drug-addled derelicts on Telegraph Avenue, about the frequent attacks on tourists in San Francisco. I reminded her of my own mugging, and informed her that everyone out here has a similar story -- or knows someone who does.
And, I told her, the worst part of it is that no one seems to care -- that citizens have become so programmed in the dogma of white privilege that they offer themselves and their children up as sacrificial lambs. Like the hostages of Stockholm, Berkeley-ites defend their abusers, protecting them rather than guarding themselves.
And finally I explained that Obama was cut from the same radical cloth -- that he surrounds himself with the type of militants who hold Berkeley captive. And, I warned her, should Obama be elected, the antisocial behavior that is tolerated in Berkeley will become the new normal all across the country.
Gail listened politely, though ultimately she voted for Obama. While she listened, she didn&apos;t really understand. Of course, she didn&apos;t -- how would she?
This wasn&apos;t her world. When you live in a safe, sheltered reality, you have no idea what it&apos;s like for people in Berkeley or Oakland or Detroit. You can&apos;t grasp what it&apos;s like to hear story after story of horrendous crime; of what it&apos;s like to attend a meeting at work one day and hear gunfire outside, as I did; or how it feels to walk to a restaurant on a cloudless blue-sky day and find yourself lying prostrate minutes later, with nose broken and two black eyes.
I didn&apos;t blame Gail; it is human nature to reject what we cannot relate to. It is impossible to fully grasp what another person goes through unless you walk in his shoes. You can&apos;t fully understand the horror of that moment when the doctor utters the word &quot;cancer,&quot; nor the enormity of being a woman enslaved by a burqua. And you cannot comprehend what it&apos;s like to live in a place like Berkeley or, to take an even more extreme example, Zimbabwe, where gang violence is not just tolerated but it is heralded as part of a noble revolution.
You can&apos;t understand this, that is, until it happens to you.
Gail told me this week that her only child, Justin, was playing basketball in the well-manicured park down the street with his college-aged friends and his girlfriend. Suddenly they were surrounded by a group of black guys from somewhere else who began taunting them, invoking racist language.
Her son and his friends yelled at them to go away, but one young male lunged at Justin, punching him in the face. Justin fell and was knocked unconscious. The hoodlums then ran away; luckily, one of the kids got their license plate. I hope and pray that small-town USA takes unprovoked street violence more seriously than places like Berkeley.
Justin became conscious again after a few minutes, but he sustained a deep gash that required several stitches. Any head injury is potentially serious. But perhaps even more worrisome than his physical wounds are the emotional ones sustained by Justin and his friends.
These are good kids, well-raised, polite, and tolerant. They have held no malice towards anyone based on the color of skin.
But will racial hate now be planted in their hearts? Will it corrupt their trusting souls? Of course, everything that is happening right now, whether in New Jersey or Wisconsin, is purposeful.
The radicals want to promote anarchy. But it&apos;s more than this: they want the hate that blackens their souls to warp others as well.
My dear friend, Gail, was in tears, shell-shocked, incredulous. She kept repeating over and over again, &quot;How could this happen? How could this happen?&quot; She struggled to find the words for such barbarism; she had not a clue of how it could invade her insular world.
I spoke to Gail tenderly, as though I were calming down a frightened child stirring from a deep sleep.
&quot;I&apos;m so sorry, sweetie. This is horrible. Justin didn&apos;t deserve to be treated this way, and his friends didn&apos;t need to see such brutality.
&quot;But, Gail, it&apos;s not just happening in your small town, but it&apos;s happening all over the country, and it&apos;s getting worse every day. There have been random mob violence against white people in Iowa, Chicago, Atlanta, in Wisconsin, where dozens of white people were beaten up, even pulled out of their own cars.&quot;
&quot;But why?&quot; Gail asked me plaintively. &quot;Why is this happening now?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s Obama,&quot; I explained. &quot;It&apos;s what I told you a few years ago. This is what happens when you put someone in power like Obama. Something spreads, like a virus. It&apos;s subtle; it&apos;s almost invisible. But it poisons one person, and then another and another, until soon the whole country is corrupted.
&quot;It&apos;s a sickness called hatred, Gail. Most black people are good, law-abiding, moral people. Obama comes from a far-left fringe group of militants who hate America and want to drag us down. Those same people have degraded and exploited poor black kids for years. These radicals use them as their foot soldiers. Obama would never get his own hands dirty.
&quot;I know these militants, Gail; I live among them. They hate America; they want to devolve us back into some primitive brute state. This is why things are getting worse and worse in this country: the economy, the Middle East, and hate crimes against whites.&quot;
After I finished, Gail was quiet for several seconds. Then she said, sounding heartbroken, &quot;But he made so many promises. He seemed so nice.&quot;
&quot;Yes, that&apos;s true, sweetie,&quot; I answered. &quot;But people aren&apos;t always as they seem.&quot;
Three years ago, I sounded the clarion call to my friend Gail to wake up and discern the person behind Obama&apos;s carefully crafted mask. I tried to make her see what would happen to this country if the radical left seized power.
Back then, she didn&apos;t understand what I was saying; she simply couldn&apos;t.
She is starting to understand now.

       Democrats Intentionally Wrote Law to Make Student Loan Interest Rates Double in Election Year
 http://conservativebyte.com...le-in-election-year/ 

   
 quote Now, this student loan stuff. It’s the focal point of Obama’s speeches that he’s making to yutes wherever he goes. He talked about it a lot yesterday. Speaking of Obama’s push to try to buy the youth vote by giving them free college tuition, remember — and we mentioned this yesterday. The interest rate increase is coming up for a vote on July 1st because the Democrat-controlled Congress in 2007 wanted it that way. Obama is running around scaring these students who don’t know the facts or the truth behind this, that if something isn’t done by the Congress, by July 1st, their student loan interest rate will double.

And then, of course, the students in the audience boo and Obama holds up his hands. “B-b-b-buh! I have a solution.” What you need to know is this: The Democrats controlled both houses of Congress in 2007. They had just won the election. The House, they took it back in 2006. Pelosi’s running the House; Democrats are running the Senate. So 2007 they passed legislation that would cut the student loan interest rate in half and then reinstituted it July 1st this year, on purpose. They wanted the college student loan interest rate to double in an election year, in the summer right before the conventions. They were rolling the dice.

Back in 2007, they didn’t know Obama was gonna be elected. They didn’t know that a Democrat would win. They didn’t know Obama would be nominated. But they were rolling the dice. They were pretty confident they were gonna win the White House. They just didn’t know with who. In fact, in 2007 it was pretty much assumed it was Hillary. In fact, that was practically etched in stone: “In 2007, it’s Hillary’s turn. She has paid here dues in so many ways.” That was the conventional wisdom. Then Obama comes along, the press swoons, and the rest is history. But still, it was a strategic maneuver in 2007 to cut the student loan interest rate in half and then put it back to what it was on July 1st.

       We Do Get You, Joe: Why Liberals Are the Crazy Ones
 http://godfatherpolitics.co...-are-the-crazy-ones/ 

   
 quote In a speech the other day in Youngstown, Ohio, Vice President Joe Biden screamed at the audience, “They just don’t get us! They don’t get who we are!”

“They,” of course, means you and me, conservative types who are just too dim to understand all the wonderful things the Obama Administration is doing for the country.

The accusation came after a rant about how jobs are “coming back” and how there were “signs of life” in the Heartland because of the administration’s hard work and economic policies.

It was a typical liberal shoutfest where the louder you yell something, the more true it becomes. I’ve heard it numerous times from some of my educated friends who should know better: “You’re blaming the guy driving the firetruck for starting the fire.” For liberals, it’s we conservatives who look crazy.

So it’s helpful once in a while to do a reality check. A little self-analysis, as with confession, is good for the soul. I mean, if you were to go crazy, wouldn’t you at least want to know that you were?

In the case of political views, side-by-side comparison of liberal vs. conservative views on President Obama is one illuminating technique.

President Obama as a person

Conservative: Obama comes from a highly suspicious background in which he was raised and schooled around numerous anti-American socialists and communists; vital records such as schooling, medical history and selective service remain not only unavailable but deliberately kept under wraps; there is evidence that suggests Obama could have used false identities and been involved in fraud; even his birth certificate appears to have been forged.
Liberal: He’s black. He’s cool.

President Obama’s economic performance
Conservative: President Obama’s stimulus packages have shown no effect in improving the economy; there is ample evidence to suggest that most of the money was used as payback to supporters; he has turned auto and other companies into essentially state-run businesses; jobs have not come back in any significant way since Obama took office, and any statistical “gains” have mostly been attributable to large numbers of Americans simply giving up any hope of finding a job, thus shrinking the number of people counted as “jobless”; three years into it, Obama is still blaming President Bush for the economy.
Liberal: President Obama says the economy is getting better, and I believe him. He’s black. He’s cool.

Obama’s foreign policy
Conservative: Obama negotiates from weakness; he began his administration by apologizing to many countries that have been our enemies and bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia; he told the Russians over an open mic that he is essentially willing to cave to their demands that we remove missile defenses in Europe; he has tacitly and overtly encouraged violence in the Middle East, even engaging in military actions against Libya without informing Congress; he has weakened America’s standing in the world and pursued a policy of having America follow the crowd rather than lead.
Liberal: Obama says we are stronger than ever, and I believe him. He’s black. You’re a racist. He’s cool. You drool.

Obama’s domestic policies
Conservative: Obama has appointed an unprecedented number of “czars” who are not subject to any scrutiny or approval by Congress or voters; his TSA is out of control, violating the privacy of travelers under the pretense of airport security; the Department of Homeland Security and the IRS have been allowed to target conservative groups for harassment; Obama’s cabinet members and czars have shown repeatedly they are willing to go around the law by quietly creating “policies” for their respective agencies that were rejected as laws by Congress; the administration has demonstrated a culture of disdain for constitutional limits on presidential power; the president himself has tried to unconstitutionally decree that religious institutions must buy into a health insurance policy with abortion and contraceptive provisions that violate religious conscience.
Liberal: Obama knows best. You’re racist. I’m going to report you. You should be on a watch list. Shut up.

So, in summation, the reason conservatives know we aren’t crazy is that we actually pay attention to what’s coming out of Washington and draw logical conclusions. Could we be wrong on any given issue? Of course. All humans are fallible.

Liberals on the other hand seem to base their beliefs solely on the fact that someone in authority “says it’s so.” So liberalism is in essence just irrational faith.

A memo to our liberal friends: The next time you go to some online site to complain about how stupid and dangerous you think conservatives are, try looking in a mirror first.

       A good summary of the left...

 The Left: Where Greed Meets Envy 

By David P. McGinley

In ascertaining the general hierarchy of sins, a good point of reference is the Ten Commandments. While the Decalogue is not all-inclusive, God dictated these specific directives to Moses as the basis upon which His people should live. Among the ten is the command not to covet: &quot;You shall not covet ... anything that belongs to your neighbor&quot; (Ex. 20:17 [NIV]).

Covetousness (or envy), meaning the possession of a strong desire for what another has, does not get the attention that its close relation &quot;greed&quot; gets. Greed, of course, is greatly derided in scripture, and for good reason, but God did not see fit to include it in the commandments He set out on Mt. Sinai. Why?
For one thing, greed is not always destructive, while envy is. Greed is the desire to have more and, depending how that desire is acted upon, can be beneficial or detrimental. The profit motive has made the United States the most prosperous nation in history; but, conversely, the abuse of that motive was greatly responsible for the September 2008 financial collapse. When envy, on the other hand, is acted upon, there is no good, only bad. At its worst, it leads to mass theft and murder.
But envy does not have to be acted upon to be harmful. Its very nature produces resentment and enmity. Thus, even dormant, the coveting of one&apos;s neighbor&apos;s belongings is destructive.

Additionally, envy is often disguised as righteous indignation against some perceived iniquity. Lately, that iniquity is most often the putative greed of others. Thus, it is not envy or covetousness that animates the outrage targeted at &quot;the rich&quot;; it is the moral certitude of seeking &quot;fairness.&quot; Thinking that at a certain point your neighbor has made enough money and that he must pay his &quot;fair share&quot; just makes things more equal because it &quot;spreads the wealth around.&quot; Disguised envy has been the motivation for many a road paved with good intentions.

Covetousness also undergirds the twin pathologies of victimhood and helplessness. Blame of the other is easier than confronting one&apos;s own mistakes and bad choices. Blaming the other because his success was supposedly at your expense makes it personal. When it is always someone else&apos;s fault, control of one&apos;s life is ceded, thereby relegating one to a passive spectator. Things just happen -- good or bad, they just happen.
On a personal level, covetousness and envy usurp any chance at a fulfilling and happy life because one can never be grateful. Life is a constant comparison to others who always appear &quot;better off,&quot; with little motivation or desire to better oneself. On a corporate level, when covetousness and envy infect a significant percentage of the populace, the results can be catastrophic.

The envious who are so quick to lament the greed of others generally focus only on one type of greed -- the love of money. However, greed is not limited to money; it manifests in many currencies, including the desire for power. While the love of money can affect the lives of others, its main objective is wealth-accumulation. Material gain is the goal, and, of course, that gain can be at the expense of others, but not always. But the desire for power is always at the expense of others because the goal is to have control over others. There is a big difference between wanting to spend one&apos;s own money and seeking the authority to tell others how they should spend theirs.
Real trouble begins when those who crave power gain it by manipulating resentments. It is where greed meets envy -- the structural foundation of the political left.
When stripped of its many pretenses, the political left&apos;s objective is control. It goes about trying to gain that control using a very simple formula: creating an enemy, and creating resentment in as many people as possible against that created enemy. It seeks to exploit envy to satiate its greed for power and never lets a crisis (real or imagined) go to waste.

The evolution of this methodology, once implemented, is quite predictable. First, an enemy is created that must be destroyed in order to help &quot;the people.&quot; That enemy can be vague or amorphous, such as &quot;imperialists&quot; or &quot;capitalists,&quot; or specific, such as Kulaks or &quot;bankers.&quot; Once that enemy is dispatched, however, a new enemy must be created. This scenario, if not stopped, continues until the powerful run out of other people&apos;s enemies, at which point the people themselves become the enemy. By that time, the people are helpless, having given away their liberty and self-sufficiency in the pursuit of manufactured vengeance. National slavery ensues.
While the left has its traditional enemies, no one and nothing is immune. Pillars of the community one day are, the next day, transmuted into the cause of national despair. What dictates is political opportunism. Thus, doctors are money-grubbers instead of hardworking healers; the white middle class are gun- and religion-clingers; grandmothers become typical white people; political opponents are racists and must be punished as enemies; advocates of traditional marriage are labeled &quot;haters&quot;; those seeking more self-government are derided as &quot;tea-baggers&quot;; people whose sincerely held religious beliefs would be violated if forced to pay for someone else&apos;s birth control or abortion are now at &quot;war with women&quot;; mothers who stay home to raise their children are sneered at for &quot;never working a day in their lives&quot;; self-made women who do not toe the feminist line are the recipients of the most vile of public insults; etc.; etc. The list of the demonized is endless because the left&apos;s greed for power is endless.
The left relies on blame and division to accumulate its power. However, without envy, the left could never attain such power in the first place. Those who do not covet the things of their neighbors never form the resentment upon which the left depends. They cannot be manipulated into turning against their neighbors and inevitably against themselves.

God commanded His people not to envy their neighbors. The breaking of this commandment leads to disaster. Envy is self-destructive, and when coupled with the greed for power, it can destroy nations. Yet the left relies upon envy for its power. &quot;They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud a man of his home, a fellowman of his inheritance&quot; (Micah 2:2 [NIV]).

       More liberal hypocrisy.
Call Holder! Obama Demands ID for Rally Entrances
 http://www.breitbart.com/Bi...s-For-Rally-Entrance 

   
 quote At a recent Obama rally in Ohio, prospective attendees were told to brandish their photo IDs if they expected admittance to the rally. No word yet on whether Attorney General Eric Holder plans to file suit against the Obama campaign for infringing upon Ohioans&apos; right of peaceful assembly by way of a racist photo ID rule.

Jessica Kershaw, the Obama campaign&apos;s Ohio Press Secretary, confirmed in a statement to BuzzFeed that the campaign checked every supporter&apos;s identification at the door.

&quot;We checked every ID at the door to make sure it matched with the name on the ticket that supporters filled out,&quot; she said. &quot;We did this for every person who came in.&quot;

Since President Obama sides with Holder in thinking it&apos;s Racist™ for states to require photo identification to vote, he must be apoplectic at himself for discriminating against those who don&apos;t get state-issued photo IDs. By asking for rally-goers to provide photo ID before entry, the Obama campaign is silently sanctioning the effectiveness of photo identification.

What makes a rally different from voter integrity? What makes buying cigarettes, alcohol, renting a car, a hotel room, cashing a check, opening a bank account, membership at the Y, buying cold medicine, or entering a club any different? You check photo identification to protect the thing which such an exchange accesses and to confirm that you are the age you claim. Is a person&apos;s vote less unworthy of protection than buying Sudafed -- or attending an Obama rally?
