About Hours 
 
An hour consists of sixty minutes. We measure out our days in hours; when we are having fun, an hour is short. While we are suffering, an hour is very very long. In the Middle Ages (the 5th century to the 15th century) Christian monks and artists created &apos;Books of Hours.&apos; They contained prayers and psalms for each hour of the day. They were &apos;illuminated,&apos; that is, their texts were illustrated in gold ink and brilliant colors. The Cloisters Museum in NYC has a wonderful collection of Books of Hours.
