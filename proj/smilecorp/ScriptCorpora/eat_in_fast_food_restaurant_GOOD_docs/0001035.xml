 SMART - Subway Makes Bacon Egg Cheese Footlong Of The Month

 In an excellent marketing move very likely to covert some folks into NEW breakfast users - Subway has made the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Flatbread - The FOOTLONG 5.00 Sub of the month. One would assume that introducing a new daypart into a long standing competitive marketplace segment, breakfast, as Subway did last year, is a slow go at best. However, this featuring of the breakfast daypart sandwich - ALLDAY - should certainly get lunch and evening trial and therefore potentially stimulate the breakfast daypart. (Hasn’t McDonald’s said in the past that they were going to make their fun menu an allday choice? Burgers before 10:30 and Biscuits in the afternoon?) http://www.subwayfreshbuzz.com/menu/footlong_of_the_month/ GREAT IDEA.

 IS Sbarro going under? - Sbarro Wins Court Approval of $16.5 Million Financing While in Bankruptcy  - http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-05/sbarro-wins-court-approval-of-16-5-million-financing-while-in-bankruptcy.html - article sites rising cheese costs and slowing consumer sales. Long time brand names going under reflects the real market IMO.

 Sometimes it is funny reading employee reactions to various advertising campaigns - like this of an Arby’s employee - http://www.ryanlmueller.com/2011/02/nibble-giggle-repeat.html and here is another opinion - http://makethelogobigger.blogspot.com/2011/03/mcarbys.html

 If It Were MY Ad Dollar 
 Filed under: Domino&apos;s Pizza , new normal , Hardee&apos;s , user categories , trier rejecters , 2 minute ad , showcase ad , undercover boss , Steak And Shake , Zaxby&apos;s , McDonald&apos;s , new products , Advertising , marketing dollars , Subway , Pizza Hut , Capt D&apos;s , Arby&apos;s , Quantitative Research —Rick Phillips @ 07:50 
 It’s worth thinking back about 2010—what fast food ads do you remember? (I wrote this in late Jan.) 

 For me, Pizza came to mind first; from the 10 Dollar  price point positioning of Pizza Hut (which offered value and an immediate clarification on pricing, always a nebulous weak point for the Pizza category) to the Domino’s ads about `sending in a picture of your pizza’and real pizza in ads from now on with no special effects (a reaching out to be more real to people - in essence just what that Undercover Boss series does). 

 Yes, that funny ad with those Valley Girl type secretaries eating Hardee’s Fresh Chicken Fingers comes to mind still too; and, Wendy’s Sea Salt Fries, but that was recent. Okay, I still have a memory or two of McDonald’s different `Wraps’type offerings, Arby’s 1.00 Menu - and Subway now offering Breakfast (all three of which induced not one action by myself until recently trying Arby’s Buck Items). Nearly all the rest is a wash. Money swept under the bridge of TV Fast Food Advertising. 

 Zaxby’s is simply that easy to whistle same music theme over and over and the folksy endorsement by small celebrities - IHOP is endlessly pushing slightly expensive breakfasts IMO - all the Casual Restaurants such as Friday’s are endlessly pushing the under 10.00 price point (and ignoring that I will be paying a tip beyond any price point that EXcludes a drink to begin with ) (not real) - and, where has the Burger KING went anyway? Price is also what I remember about Capt. D’s ads - and Steak and Shake - while price AND size is what I remember about Taco Bell. (As I go mentally thru my local Woodstock Ga. Fast Food Market.) 

 My guess is that some marketing departments are patting themselves on the back - they have gotten the point thru to a weary America that `eating out’ can fit into a reduced `frills’budget diet the new normal has put America onto . 

 But, PRICE may be less compelling - especially emotionally to a consumer - than the reward of trying a new product offering that sounds especially good; one that you may be excited to tell a friend about. And, less compelling than trying to directly talk to consumers like the Pizza category did in 2010. IMO. 

 So, what would I do if it were MY ad dollar? 

 I’d want to stand out. 

 For example, to `reach the consumer’would 4 thirty second ads bunched with a block of perhaps 4 minutes of similar ads each time - sound like a way to stand out—OR—WOULD A TWO MINUTE `SHOWCASE’AD?—————–Heck, even 24 - Five second logos might have more impact than the standard forgettable 30 second ad a week into a new ad flight. 

 IMO, with `Showcase’Ads - Brands can address all the marketing categories with 3 or 4 variations (a strategy not often used) - first and foremost, the `frequency-rejecter’- that is the core population base that is aware of your brand, has used it in the past - but now, it has been so long, as to be a `trier-rejector’(at least to YOU the owner of the brand) of the brand - having replaced it with other choices. 

 IMO, many of these people can be lured back - and many fall into the influenced by advertising campaigns motif - that ad agencies have long relied upon for improvement of sales during sales campaigns . IMO, they could be targeted MUCH more via a Showcase ad . 

 After all, REGULAR users are JUST that - and are UNLIKELY to be significantly changing their Frequency of Usage over any term ; other than to bump up the next visit interval by a few days, perhaps. Much more effective ways exist to market to your existing customer base than TV mass advertising. 

 Of course, the ultimate boom would exist on MAKING A NEW USER ENTIRELY - the total rejecter; never user (for all practical purposes) - certainly a Showcase Ad for these extremely low awareness of what your brand IS market - can become better informed and tempted about what YOU have to offer via your brand. 

 These LOW-KEY, almost, aw-shucks ads - like an infomercial - are the emotional connection to change behaviour———not the mind numbing, what did I just see, 30 second blasts of normalcy.

 Case Study Follow-Up: What Firehouse Subs Learned 
 Filed under: heathcare mandates , offer wedding reception , sign wavers , Firehouse Subs , McDonald&apos;s , Ruby Tuesday&apos;s , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 08:04 
 

 http://www.mobilebillboardfranchise.com/Portals/85285/images/Firehouse%20Subs%201.jpg 

 Woodstock, Ga. has a Firehouse Subs and I’ve used it numerous times. This link explores the outcome of re-instating advertising and its very strong effect on store sales - also includes the tidbit that having a sign waver in front of the store can increase sales 10-15% by capturing the late decider as they drive into the area - http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/case-study-follow-up-what-firehouse-subs-learned/ - more details too. 

 Ruby Tuesday’s confirms, like McDonald’s, that Obama Healthcare mandates due in 2014 will strongly affect the industry and is scrambling to move into concepts that involve fewer full-time workers as staff - http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201010071611dowjonesdjonline000543&amp;title=ruby-tuesdayhealthcare-law-a-factor-in-fast-casual-foray McDonald’s to offer wedding receptions in Hong Kong -

Is this a tip of the iceberg.

 KFC Uses Coed Buns To Advertise Bunless Sandwich 
 Filed under: lower calorie , new sandwich , Ad On College Coeds , Vegan Burger , brand image , Colonel Sanders , KFC Double chicken sandwich , Healthy Fast Food , Lunch users , new products , KFC , Denny&apos;s , Subway , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 06:31 
 

 One must pat KFC on the back for this inexpensive marketing move - pay a few coeds to advertise your bunless sandwich - targeted at males - on the buns (backsides, butts, buttocks) of pretty college coeds. Is `anything fried’becoming a male dominated target demo? As the link says `a head turning’idea - http://www.restaurantnews.com/kfc-places-double-down-ads-on-the-backsides-of-sweat-pants-worn-by-college-co-eds/

Also, burgers are a strong lunch product often times.

 Quick Restaurant Thoughts And Links 
 Filed under: Alexa Rankings , new normal , coupons , TV commercial , CiCi&apos;s Pizza , license plate reading , HoneyBaked Ham , breakfast daypart , daypart promotion , Burger King , new products , Sonic , O&apos;Charley&apos;s , Steak And Shake , daypart pricing , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 10:08 
 It’s scant data but this website is once again in the Alexa Rankings - http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/restauranttradearearesearch.com # - the stats from 1&amp;1 my host would indicate a growing readership too. 

 So, I have now seen the TV ad campaign for the new Burger King Breakfast menu—–to me—–OK, but, strange IMO. I mean, ONLY MEN marching in the street? (I noted the various types of men from office to laborer to `funny’still in bathrobe man.) I thought BK wanted to slowly move to less emphasis on ONLY the male target. The commercial also left me wondering what these products were that I only had a few seconds to view all together. 

 Recently got two very different coupons via the mail for Honeybaked Ham and CiCi’s. HH offered a 6.99 combo and CiCi’s offered a 3.99 adult buffet. Now my first statement is that CiCi’s hasn’t offered this price point for quite sometime, and, became famous for it when the chain was in full expansion mode prior to the new normal. Except for the fact that the coupon was only for one person (why not make it for more than one on the same coupon) - it was a very compelling reason `to return’to having CiCi’s be part of the mix of restaurants used. Whereas, my first thought about HH was - WTH?—What is the NORMAL price if this is the `value’they now are offering (and in the same plaza as a Subway with a 3.99 daily deal)? And, who in the world is this coupon trying to compete with - O’Charley’s? 

 I’ve also caught sight of the fact that the Woodstock Steak and Shake - in addition to meeting the new afternoon dayparting of drink prices (like Sonic) - to attract some of those `convenience store’types—they now offer the same 2-1 deal from 2AM to 4AM—very cool. 

 And, here’s a new technology that even mentions usage by Fast Food Chains - Bump Uses License Plate Image Recognition to Text Fellow Drivers - Includes this statement: 

 Fast food restaurants, for example, could use the technology to offer personalized menus to drive-thru customers, as based on their previous selections

 Top Of Mind Restaurant Ads 
 Filed under: Chili&apos;s , Domino&apos;s Pizza , upscaling , upscale salads , freshness , Hardee&apos;s , Quiznos , Wendy&apos;s , KFC , Capt D&apos;s , Zaxby&apos;s , Steak And Shake , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 10:21 
 When I do some of my on the street - top of mind interviewing - I often ask my respondents about recall for Restaurant Advertising - here’s an example interview - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTRO81RR7DA . Anyway, as I got to thinking of it just now - I thought I’d `do myself’so to speak. 

 And the ad I like the most - is - Hardee’s; specifically the two `valley’girl secretaries who are eating the `fresh’breaded Chicken Strips and ignoring the `annoying’phone calls they should be answering. To me, it’s hilarious and gets the message across about Freshness and upscaled. 

 The Wendy’s `talking couple’ads about the new Fresh Salads (different types being featured) also comes across as promoting the Freshness and upscaled - with a bit of humor too. (The distracting relationship of the male and female Wendy’s worker.) 

 The Domino’s Pizza chief with his `not fluffed up’pizza photography ads are next for me. Connects that his (Domino’s) pizza is Real Food and to not wanting to `fool the customer’(implying the others do). The invite for consumers to send in their own pictures also connects at the personal level. 

 Captain D’s slogan recently - `Cookin in the Kitchen’- caught my attention for its snappiness and food shots. 

 Chili’s - 5.99 Hamburgers caught my attention for low price point for sit-down casual (tipping locations) and product shot. 

 Steak and Shake coupons for Butter Pecan milkshakes increased my desire to go. 

 KFC - I’ve caught myself singing - G Double O D Goooooood - reluctantly a time or two. Catchy. 

 Quizno’s - 3, 4, and 5 dollar combos. Like this idea of a sliding combo price. 

 The laid back Zaxby’s tune - so easy to whistle.

 Price Point Stalking - The New Normal

 Putting promotion and advertising dollars behind various price points is nothing new in the restaurant category - but - in 2010 - it would seem to be of huge importance based on the current crop of ad positionings positioning prices. For example - check out this list of price points promoted in the past year in the Atlanta ADI at least: 

 79 cents - Taco Bell (occasionally). 

 99cents - Wendy’s Value Menu - Capt. D’s sides 

 1.00 - McDonald’s Dollar Menu; Burger King, Arby’s, Checkers 

 1.50 (2/3.00) - Checkers, Dairy Queen (occasionally) 

 1.99 - Snack meals - Mrs. Winners, Church’s, KFC (occasionally), Dunkin Donuts, 

 2.00 Denny’s 

 2.50 Subway Breakfast Combo 

 Meals For One 

 2.99 Combo’s - McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Krystal, Boston Market 

 3.99 Long John Silvers, KFC, (4.00)Firehouse Subs&gt;4Pm (4.00) Steak&amp;Shake, (4.00) Quizno’s, 3.99 Hardee’s, (4.00) Denny’s 

 5.00 - Subway Footlong, Boston Market 5.oo + sides, (5.01) Arby’s, (4.99) Waffle House, (4.99) CiCi’s Pizza, (5.00) Little Ceasar Pizza, (4.99) Denny’s, 5.00 - Capt. D’s lunch, (4.99) - Zaxby’s, 

 5.99 Domino’s Pizza, 6.00-Denny’s 

 8.00 Denny’s 

 6.99-9.99 - Friday’s, Ruby Tuesday’s, Ryan’s, Golden Corral, (10.00) Pizza Hut, Folks Restaurant, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Applebees, 

 And now, with smaller portions becoming more accepted at a reduced price (often with more profit however) - the under 10.00 to eat AT a restaurant perception continues to grow.

 Building A Restaurant `Audience’ 
 Filed under: money giveaway , brand loyalty , building an audience , Adding Entertainment , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 13:57 
 As I’ve mentioned in the last few posts - the customer frequency of your customer base is the number one attribute of concern to your fast food restaurant. And, if you want your customer base to `listen’to your promotions - perhaps it is time to treat them like a `listener’to your channel/brand. One that they can be `loyal’to (as I mentioned in the last post) - one they are connected with - involved with. 

 Indeed, it might be time in this new era of the Great Recession - to use one of the old standards of giveaways that radio used for decades to `maintain’and grow listenership - and that is—give away LOCAL MONEY. Literally at the store level. To `listeners’(customers) who followed the `promotion’for entry. 

 So, for `drink-only, drive-thru’customers - that meant using `their’Drink Only `clubcard’(which had a discount for drinks two and three) twice more for a chance at entry in the `monthly customer loyalty drawing’. Other folks would be turning in their `nite-owl’cards with a similar idea to forming a (sub) brand loyalty - or a breakfast club. 

 Likewise, operators need to reach out to other - mainstream frequency programs - and use them in the same manner; (such as combo club, sandwich club, dessert club, or all milkshake purchases today get entry, etc.) - all for a chance to enter the LOCAL `money giveaway’. Indeed, the chance to `win’100 or 200 bucks - EVERY month - will stay in the customers mind. 

 Winners will be `announced’on the outside reader board (giving customers a reason to read it at other times too) and inside too. The drawing will be LIVE in the store - creating an event. The winner will be posted on a winners board for all to see. JOE SMITH - 200 DOLLAR WINNER - COMBO CLUB CUSTOMER. 

 In the meantime, the `entries’(the club cards with E-Mail addresses or phone numbers/addresses) will provide you with a usable custom marketing base for your selected marketing efforts. For your new loyal `audience’.

 Effective Billboard Advertising 
 Filed under: In-and-Out burgers , billboards , Customer Base Size , Advertising , MarketView —Rick Phillips @ 08:05 
 Hello, welcome back to Restaurant Trade Area Research - and today - that is just what will be discussed. 

 Markets which use my MarketView marketing research design find out the information needed to have truly effective billboard advertising. And, no, I’m NOT talking about `what’is even on the billboard - I’m talking about placement. 

 Yes, placement - one of those  P’s of marketing. How you ask? 

 Well, the MarketView maps your trade area for each of your stores in an ADI and more importantly for this `effectiveness’- finds out important customer information which determines the actual customer base size of an individual store in a market. 

 While it may seem counter-intuitive, your store with the largest volume may NOT be the store with the largest customer base - indeed, some of your lowest volume stores may fit that characteristic. How you ask? 

 Well, any store, and often lower sales volume stores - have LARGE customer bases with INFREQUENT users - indeed, some Fast Food Units may have 10-15,000 or more infrequent users compared to other units. And that is a lot of extra users being exposed to a particular billboard ad. 

 Additionally, because a unit (and market) has had its customer base Trade Area mapped as part of the research of the MarketView, even the side of the street for most exposure to the most customers can easily be selected for better billboard effectiveness.

 The Burger `King’ 
 Filed under: Cheesecake Factory , Creepy , Friday&apos;s , Casual dining , Zaxby&apos;s , Delivery , the Burger `King&apos; , Burger King , calorie count on menu board , fast food law , FernBars , McDonald&apos;s , Arby&apos;s , Ruby Tuesday&apos;s , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 10:39 
 Hello, thanks for visiting my blog about restaurant research - something I’ve done for over 30 years. As you might know, I’ve been trying to bring to you a blend of posts - some with insights about marketing research and others just commentary on the whole subject of restaurants. 

 The data of this website also indicates that on posting days—we are getting 100’s of visitors who sometimes hit and read as many as 8 links each (but, generally it’s 2-5 links each). I say that so that you know that if you just continue to `read down’the page that you will probably find lots of interest to a restaurant owner or manager like yourself. (Corporate folks are allowed to read too. Lol) 

 Today, I’ve decided to continue last weeks look at particular fast food (FF) commercials (last weeks post was Arby’s `Marry A Goat’ad) - this week I’m posting on one of my personal alltime favorites - The Burger `King’—if you’d like to know more about his history - use this link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burger_King . 

 As you know, I panned Arby’s `Marry The Goat’ad as `too edgy’in my last posting (that said, it does get across the main selling idea of a combo at 5.00) and just too creepy . No, for creepy, - at an appropriate level - The Burger `King’is the epitome. It is also great that `King’is only used sparingly and with many different commercial versions on-going. 

 My favorite King commercial is, as I posted recently, - the `reverse bandit’King who ends up getting SMASHED by a car. Totally smashed in a manner that a human would never survive - only the King - with the unchanging face. 

 Two different chains - two different takes on saving money - with two different takes on Creepiness. I can’t wait for Halloween.

 `Marry A Goat’? 
 Filed under: Chick-Fil-A , Arby&apos;s , McDonald&apos;s , fast food law , drive-thru&apos;s , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 07:45 
 While I’m not sure of how many markets have the new Arby’s ad - sometimes attention grabbing `humorous’ads might not be worth it. If you haven’t seen the new ad - two workers out in a field are hungry for lunch; one guy laments he has only 5 bucks; the other says we can go to Arby’s for any of their toasted subs, curly fries, and a drink for 5 bucks (hope the guy has some pocket change for the tax); and his friend, not believing the deal says if that is so `I’ll marry a goat’. 

 Flash forward to the `friend’now dressed in a tux sitting next to a goat in full bride headset—while his friend sitting across from him, while gawking at the goat, whispers from behind his Toasted Sub with a wink to his friend that `She’s HOT’. Leaving the viewer wondering about the newlyweds first evening together as the punchline humor. 

 Verdict - 4.99 combos on a large sandwich at Arby’s good - usage of marginal humor - not so good. Especially after multiple viewings. 

 Ok, onwards to today’s links—with MUCH emphasis on Drive-thru’s.

 Spend Less Here (Trade Down) - The `New’Fast Food Mantra 
 Filed under: Capt D&apos;s , Pizza Hut , trading down to FF , China , Burger King , Arby&apos;s , fast food law , Checkers , Red Lobster , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 06:52 
 This weekend I was watching some sports on TV when the `new’Burger King ad with the King came on the screen. Anything with the KING gets my attention. This one  began with a `consumer’holding a BK sandwich, who evidently `finds’money in his pocket (that shouldn’t be there) and he is complaining about this to a policeman. The policeman says `reverse pickpocket’and asks for a description - which, while being given by the `consumer’results in the classic `THERE HE IS’- cops and `robbers’chase. 

 Off to the races goes The King crossing over a busy street while evading the law. Only to be SMASHED by a yellow cab. (With an impact that could easily kill a real person and you the observer literally feel it.) Yes, t he first viewing had my full attention and brought amusement in addition to the message of BK itself—you can save money by eating with us. Expect to see more of the reverse pickpocket. 

 The BK ad ran within minutes of another FF comparison ad - this one for Capt D’s (seafood). In this one, in a parking lot aside of a Red Lobster,—customers of the RL are approached and asked how much money their meal cost. I saw two different ads on this and one said 80 dollars and the other 100 dollars - at which moment the Capt D’s renegade interviewer brings the RL party over to a makeshift area with a long folding table where Capt D’s employees crank out one meal after another and tell the RL group they could have had `all this’and spent 40.00 less. The mantra, again; you can save money eating with us. 

 Which brings me to the two `fake restaurant’ads currently in the Atlanta market being run by FF brands. The first is the *obnoxious Pizza Hut ads where it is `their pasta’which is being served in the restaurant that evening. So, after `candid’praise for the pasta - the `upscale’diners `laugh’about how they were fooled by the quality. Indeed, why would you be a fool and go to a sit down restaurant, pay thru the roof,—when you can get `restaurant quality’delivered to your door. The mantra, you can save money here, by eating at home. 

 (* what is actually obnoxious is the version of the ad where the PH girl rips her `apron’off to reveal her PH identification - she does it in a manner that somehow shouts—~you idiots-jokes on YOU~). 

 OR, you can also find the other fake restaurant ad for Hardees and their Big Burger products. The idea; don’t pay 8.00 for a 4.00 burger. The mantra; you can save money by eating with us. 

 Finally, in Atlanta, Arby’s stores seem onto the price position with the 99 cent ArbyQ plastered (tastefully) over the store outside banners—while the Checkers down the road makes sure its customerbase knows it has 69 cent Sundays and Wednesdays. 

 Because of the economic uncertainty, the market for the upper middle and lower upper classes for FF restaurants is increasing . Promoting the `savings’with quality  via trading down is one approach - expect to see this even more.

 McDonald’s Perception Change 
 Filed under: Subway , Chick-Fil-A , market sales , Marketing to Kids , happy meals/ kids meals , Arby&apos;s , Wendy&apos;s , McDonald&apos;s , Advertising , Trade Area , new products , cannibalization , prices , Quantitative Research —Rick Phillips @ 07:23 
 Last year, I personally interviewed several thousand fast food customers (in-store and drive-thru) in a variety of fast food brands for Trade Area Research purposes. (Do you need trade research before expanding your market?) This was normal for me as I have  personally interviewed thousands of fast food customers for dozens of years . And, as you might know, certain questions are nearly standard on questionnaires trying to understand customer behaviour - such as the fast food restaurant that the customer uses `most often’. 

 In the 1980’s and even into the late 1990’s - when adults answered that question for me—when the answer was McDonald’s - they would immediately offer a `reason’, in an apologetic tone, which invariably was `the kids’. That is not to say that I didn’t hear `they are everywhere’and `they are cheap’on occasion. Nevertheless, the interesting thing was that `other brands’such as Wendy’s or Arby’s or Chick-Fil-A  or others (such as sandwich chains Subway) - most often users ALMOST NEVER offered up `embarrassing’reasons for their usage of a particular brand most. Only McDonald’s. It was almost a case of doing `marketing’too well. 

 Then, McDonald’s focused less on kids and more on product and product quality. I began to hear folks say that they liked a `particular new product’at McDonald’s that they went for `most often’. Kids, as a reason, was definitely fading quickly (I informed my clients who at first seemed surprised in the early 2000’s —it was the kind of information that only came from literally being on the ground for multiple brands for decades) - the return of McDonald’s was approaching. 

 The moral - If the biggest can change a negative perception—other brands, most of which have neutral images , can also build a positive one - like McDonald’s has done.
