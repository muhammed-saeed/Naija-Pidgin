Denver police believe they have the license-plate number of an SUV that struck and killed parking valet Jose Medina Saturday and asked Monday for the public&apos;s help in locating the vehicle.

Medina, 21, was hit Saturday night as he held a car door open for a patron outside the Rockstar Lounge, 940 Lincoln St. Police identified the suspect vehicle Monday as a white GMC extended-cab pickup with Colorado license plate 895-VYF.

Five detectives and two sergeants are working the case, said Lt. Robert Rock, commander of Denver&apos;s Traffic Investigation Bureau. &quot;I&apos;m confident that we are going to, at a minimum, have the vehicle very soon.&quot;

In the last nine months of 2010, there were 2,367 hit-and-run cases in Denver, and police solved 56 percent of them. But three of the six fatal hit-and-runs last year remain unsolved, Rock said.

Without witnesses who recall or record details of an offending vehicle—details such as the license plate—police say solving a hit-and-run is tough.

Even locating the vehicle doesn&apos;t guarantee someone will be prosecuted. &quot;Sometimes you get the car, and the owner has no knowledge of it. Without anything to put him behind the wheel, that is a case we can&apos;t clear,&quot; Rock said.

Medina, who was born in Nebraska, moved to Denver from Salt Lake City last year, said Gabriel Schwartz, a lawyer for Medina&apos;s family.

Medina worked at the fast-food restaurant Good Times but got a second job moving cars at Rockstar to buy his fiancee a birthday present, said Schwartz. &quot;Her birthday is today,&quot; Schwartz said Monday. &quot;He was just a good kid.&quot;

His case is the third high-profile hit-and-run in just a few weeks in the metro area.

The cases of Laura Gorham, who was hit in the Stapleton neighborhood on Dec. 9, and Keino Taylor, who was struck in Aurora at Peña Boulevard and Chambers Road on Dec. 16, also remain unsolved.

Both survived. Gorham was 34 weeks pregnant when a driver ran a stop sign and struck her. She was critically injured and lost her baby.

Taylor was helping to push a disabled vehicle out of the way when he was struck. He lost part of his leg.

The commander of the Aurora police traffic section, Lt. Chuck DeShazer, is hoping someone has information in Taylor&apos;s case. &quot;I&apos;m really begging the public to come forward. Somebody knows. It is frustrating.&quot;

The fact that Taylor was struck on a busy thoroughfare is particularly frustrating, De-Shazer said. Although numerous people called 911 to report the aftermath of the crash, no one has provided a good identification of the car.

&quot;There is so much traffic out there, but nobody sees the guy, nobody follows. A whole lot of people called in to report the aftermath, but if anybody did see the car, they didn&apos;t follow it,&quot; he said.

Physical evidence left at the scene of a hit-and-run—debris from the vehicle that caused the accident—can only take investigators so far, said DeShazer.

A bumper, piece of grill or other wreckage can help identify the make and model of a vehicle, but most automakers produce thousands of each manufactured model, said Miriam Reed, a retired Denver police traffic investigator. &quot;The problem is, in many hit-and-runs, you just don&apos;t have enough information to pursue the subject vehicle.&quot;

And when the victim is a pedestrian, there is often less evidence to discover, Rock said.

Anyone with information in any of the unsolved cases can call Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP (7867).

 Post Poll - Plastic Bag Fee 

Should Denver impose a fee on shoppers who request plastic bags in grocery stores? 
  Absolutely: Those shoppers who use non-biodegradable plastic bags should pay the price for landfill maintenance.  Sure: I&apos;ve used cloth bags for years and am doing my part; why can&apos;t everyone else?  No: It&apos;s just another way for government to try to pick our pockets.  Don&apos;t care: I worry more about air pollution.
