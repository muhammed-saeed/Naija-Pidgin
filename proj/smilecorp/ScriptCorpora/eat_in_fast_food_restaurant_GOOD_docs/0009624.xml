 Roxana Mtanyos 7/4/12 
 I have never been treated as bad as I was today July 4 th 2012 at the McDonals in Grand Coteau La. I went through the drive through at 10:05 am , I ordered breakfast I was asked to pull up to the empty parking spot they would walk my food out to me , I move like I&apos;m asked twenty minutes later I go In because no one has come out with my food, I&apos;m told by
the manager that they thought I left so they threw my food and would not fix me breakfast because it&apos;s now 10:30 am breakfast is over now remember Ive already paid for my breakfast before it was over this was there mistake management was so rude I&apos;ll drive ten more minutes I will post and repost on every wall I have how I was treated by the loser management at the Grand Coteau McDonalds , one more thing he didn&apos;t want to give me my money back for the drinks poorest service
I&apos;ve ever had. 



 SANDRA BROWN 6/1/12 
 MY NAME IS SANDRA BROWN (696-936-8051) I WENT TO OUR MCDONALDS AT 94 AND HARVESTER TONIGHT. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPONTED EVER. I AM ON MY FOURTH CHILD WITH HAPPY MEALS. MY OLDEST SON WENT TO GET DINNER FOR HIM, HIS GIRL FRIEND&amp;HIS LITTLE SISTER. HE ORDERED TWO LARGE MEALS AND LG FRY W/LG SODA. HE WAS TOLD HE COULD HAVE 1 RANCH DIP. HIS GIRL FRIEND WENT IN TO EXPLAIN THEY WOULD NEED AT LEAST TWO RANCH DIPS BECAUSE HIS SITER NEEDS TWO FOR HER FRIES.SHE WAS TOLD NO. I THOUGHT MCDONALDS WAS ALL ABOUT OUR CHILDREN. MY SON THEN CALLED MCDONALDS UPSET AND ASKED FOR A DISTRICT MANAGER NUMBER AND WAS HUNG UP ON. I CALLED UP TO MCDONALDS AND ASKED FOR THE MANAGER-SHE ANSWERD. I EXPLAINED TO HER THAT I THOUGHT WITH TWO LG MEALS, LG FRY AND LG DRINK MORE THEN ONE RNCH DIP WASNT ASKINH TWO MUCH.SHE EXPLAINED THAT PEOPLE ASK FOR 5 DIPS WITH A BURGER ORDER ALL THE TIME. BUT WE DIDNT. SHE OFFERED FREE MEALS BUT I GUESS I AM STILL UPSET. I ASKED HER WHY WOULD ANYONE HANG UP ON MY SON IF HE ASKED FOR A DISTRICT MANAGER NUMBER AND SHE SAID I ONLY HAD ONE CALL AND I COULDNT HEAR (HIM) SAY ANYTHING. I HAVE BEEN GOING TO MCDONAlDS FOREVER (I AM 51 YEARS OLD AND FOUR CHILDREN LATER). AFTER THE RONALD MCDONALD SAYING HE IS THERE FOR OUR CHILDREN....REALLY. NO MORE THEN 1 RANCH DIP PER ORDER...OR YOU ARE CHARGED 15 CENTS PER RANCH DIP.
NOT SO HAPPY WITH MCDONALDS,
SANDI BROWN AND FAMILY 



 current pissed off Mcdonalds worker.. 6/3/12 
 I have been working for Mcdonalds for almost to months now and I absolutely hate it. I have seen the way the food is cooked and the way staff is treated, I wanted to quit after three weeks and I no longer eat McDonald&apos;s food.
I work in a store in London, yet the majority of workers in my store are from different countries and many have actually bragged about how their visa&apos;s have run out but their paid cheques every to weeks means McDonald&apos;s managers wont find out.even if they did find out they would not care because their is obviouse favourites in the store. Shift managers/ &apos;&apos;team leaders&apos;&apos; are the biggest CUNTS ever, because they earn an extra 50p more than some workers they think they can shout and scream at you all day, and instead of doing work themselves. Because I am quite young and in my last year of schooling I have specifically said I cannot stay paid 7pm when I work because it takes me an hour to get home, however there have been nights when I had to stay until 8-9pm. The thing that pisses me off the most is that some days when I have finished I got to clock out only to find out my manager has already clocked me out, it is my clock in number he should not be allowed to do this, especially as some days he finishes at 5pm. IM SURE I AM NOT GETTING PAID FOR THE TIME I AM CLOCKED OUT. but of course If i bring this up and talk about it to my manager he casually makes up some bullshit. Last week i wrote down all my hours i did and it was 42 hours, however I was only paid 130.. at 4.00 an hour that means I was only clocked in for 32 hours.
Aside from being understaffed there are more problems within McDonalds,
I am made to rummage through the bins every time I clean them to count the inventory of what food has been wasted, i do this WEARING NO GLOVES. disgusting. of course the shift managers dont care.but I make sure i always clean my hands after because i do not want to serve dirty food.
I am on tills by the way, I am shouted at for every mistake, although it is only because I am new and can get stressed when there is a lot of pressure and i am expected to do a meal within 3minutes.this can be really stressful rushing around constantly ALL DAY.
and the worst part is the staff do not care about you and will push you out of the way to get their food, instead of pass you they will move you. this can get to be quite annoying and makes you feel not very respected at all.

Also,
-the way the rags are cleaned is disgusting, why can McDonalds not afford disposable ones? that would be more sanitary.

-buying fucking air conditioning would probably help improve working conditions, Ive noticed that the managers office has air conditioning but no where else in the store.

-general managers should be made to go through anger management classes to stop them being cunts to the employees.

-being charged for my uniform is absolutely disgusting, your company will do anything to make money from everyone else. AND TAKING 10% OF MY MINIMUM WAGES TO PAY FOR MY OWN HOLIDAY. vile. I would rather have no holiday pay than you steal it from me.

-apparently their is a rule about having to change your uniform every hour, I only heard about this today when I came across a sign in the crew room, I have never heard anything about this before?? how can i change my uniform if you only give me one shirt and one skirt?? or is that sign only for show.

working for your company has made me depressed and resentful, i will quit in a few weeks, Im only working there to get a bit of money, but the money is not worth the grudging work. I ahve not eaten Mcdonalds food because I know what disgusting things are in it.

anyone reading this, should watch the film &apos;FAST FOOD NATION&apos; (or read the book by eric schlosser) it is the perfect portrayal of the real McDonalds.



aint nothing happy about a happy meal.

 6/3/12 17:47. Store #17851 Covington, LA. We ordered 3 big Mac meals for takeout. We drove off and discovered the food was not edible. The bread was old, the lettuce and toppings were as if we had food pulled and reused from the garbage. It as horrible and we were unable to eat our food. I hope we do not get sick after attempting to consume a few bites. We wastes $15. Shame on this McDonald&apos;s for serving such a disgrace. Sincerely Arkansas travelers.

 Me 6/6/12 
 I went to mcdonalds in mannington,wv the lady who waited on me was rude and never said thaks or anything thats she should have. Thry cant get the orders correct, most of the time its cold and its supposed to be fastfood but I have waited 10 minutes for a sweet tea, it wasnt even sweet. One person handed my order and she had black grease all over her hands, looked like she was working on a car. 



 6/6/12 
 Please RECALL the GLASS COKA COLA GLASSES GIVEN AWAY WITH THE VALUE MEAL LAST FALL.
Ive talked to two people in customer service to create an awareness. I have 12 stiches in my hand as a result of simply washing one of these glasses. The glass is very thin and breaks easily. I pray you do a recall on these glasses as they are dangerous. Ms. Evans

 I live in St. Cloud, Florida. I work at the McDonalds on Canoe Creek Road was hired in March 2012, Had orientation March 17, 2012. During my interview I told the interviewer that I because of my responsibility to my church and my religion I could not work Monday night, Wednesday night, and until after 1pm on Sundays. Because of this I have been scheduled one day a week every other week. Management has made some very unacceptable comments because of my religious demands. Another problem is that one manager in particular seems to be very prejudice towards me. She is Hispanic and I am not. She gets very offended when I have to ask her to repeat herself. Tonight she made a couple of very disrespectful comments regarding my faith and because I asked her if there was something else to do while one job was completing so I was not just standing around she told me &quot;just go home there is no reason for you to be here&quot; When I explained that my ride was not here and it was raining. She made the comment &quot;Well my God is not here but I can still go home&quot;
I was very excited about working for McDonalds, I am sixteen and this was my first job and I felt the values of McDonalds reflected respect for it&apos;s employees but I have quickly found that just because the they may reflect the values of the corporation it is not true about some of the management. I know as a Christian it is told in the Bible that I will face persecution but I was unaware that I would face it from management at McDonalds.
Thank you for taking the time to read this and considering the ramifications should this type of prejudice continue.

 We were traveling through Joplin and stopped at the McDonalds there#3330. I can&apos;t say when I have been in a more nasty restaurant then that. Trash running over, 20 something year olds with shirts off , girls with very little on and workers sitting back at tables when the place Is a nasty mess. Went there to get something but no thanks . I know you would not want them representing you like that. Very sad what our younger workers are coming up like. It would be worth your time to check out this black eye that Is part of your chain. Thank You for your time

 Richmond Mi. McDonalds is the best in the state when manager Julie (tall slim lady) is working. Julie is polite, professional, and just a hard worker. I hope she never leaves or Richmond&apos;s Mcdonalds will suffer. 



 Prefer CLEAN service 6/11/12 
 Took our kids to McDonalds in Robinson IL last night. While waiting for our food I saw a young man in the sandwich prep area eating an ice cream cone WITH his gloves on. They should NEVER be allowed to EAT in the kitchen EVER!!! And I certainly hope he changed his gloves when he was done. But after what I saw next, I doubt it. Went to get our drinks and NO ice in the machine; found out later (from a friend) that over 3 hours earlier that day, it was out of ice then too. While sitting at our table, people were going up and eating french fries out of the fry table with their bare hands and then going right on working!! No washing hands&amp;contaminating other fries, GROSS!! Plus scratching hair, face , etc. The shift manager was so busy playing with her cell phone, she couldn&apos;t have cared less. I am reporting them to the health department today also. 



 Iowa 6/12/12 
 You know I have read some of these issues concerning McDonalds. I would like to first address the person Ashley, I am sorry to hear about your situation and I hope you do get a lawyer and achieve something, but I want you aware that all the businesses that hire people do the same thing they create things to fire their employees. Iowa is a at will employment law, The store director at Hy-vee in CC iowa will tell you right I have never paid unemployment and will lie to keep that record. They had employees who have stole over 1000.00 from the store and all they got was asked to resign and no charges. The McDonalds in New Hampton Iowa has a mananger who will call and tell you point blank get you F????? A..... to work that is more important than being with your father who just had a heart atttack and the owner of McDonalds in that town allows this to go on and doesn&apos;t even suspend her or nothing and she even went so far as chewing the husband out and telling him he was worthless. I go to McDonalds on a rare occassion because it&apos;s a guarentee that the order is wrong or they just throw your food in the sack any old way. The shakes from now on if I want a shake I will go to Dairy Queen or some where else. The only thing I go through McDonalds for is the coffee. 



 anonymous 6/13/12 
 McDonald on Staten Island, NY corner of Midland ave and Hylan Blvd..what do you think of francise that locks the front door(fire hazard) once school is out so the can monitor who they let in at the side door, turning away anyone school age child not acompanied by an adult.....they also have set up both video and audio in the work area as well as the employee room so they can spy on the workers from home and call in demands.... how imoral of these francise owners, they don&apos;t even supply soft mats for the workers to stand on while they are on their feet for hours on end ...Im going to loge a complaint with my local fire department about the locked front door.. in an emergency, their would be no way to get out unless some came a unlocked the door.. just waiting for a crisis on this so the coporation can be named in a lawsuit... many mnay other isses as well here.... 



 6/14/12 
 why can mcdonalds advertise there coffee at 1.00 doller and some places charge other prices.i would that,s false advertiseing. 



 disgruntaled customer 6/16/12 
 Regarding 5107 John young and americana store. Worst customer service our family has ever had. Asked for ice cream cone and got a fudge sunday. Food tasted like cleaning product. Employees not wearing gloves, talking on phones, texting at front counter in front of geust. When asked to speak to manager was given rude gestures and treated very unprofessional. Manager was less helpful and madeit seem like our fault. I am very disapointed in this entiire store and refuse on giving them any more of my time or money.

 June 16th 2012 I visited one of your restaurants in Lompoc California #1716 on 835 N. H Street. And I seen all the managers gathered around talking to each other while I was waiting at the counter to ask for some ketchup. Some looked at me and noticed me there but kept talking. The managers names were Jerry Nick and Noemi. This needs to be dealt with that is not good customer service on the side of that Jerry and Nick were also flirting with two girls and touching them that was disturbing and shouldn&apos;t be presented in public like that. Please deal with this, this not first time I reported things like this happening. I wanted the number to the store manager to tell them or head leader but the refused to give me it. So I wrote all their names down and I&apos;m telling you all right now again. HANDLE THIS! OR I WILL GET THE PLACE SHUT DOWN SERIOUSLY. Have some typebof supervisor watching them daily thanks

 I&apos;ve had many times where McDonald&apos;s has made a mistake on my order or given me something burnt or cold, but this was by far the worst McDonald&apos;s experience ever. I ordered an Iced Mocha and a McChicken. I took the lid of my mocha, as I do not like to drink coffee through a straw, and started chugging it down. As I got to the end of my mocha, I felt something long and slimy sliding down my throat. I started choking on it, reached half way down my throat and pulled out A PIECE OF PLASTIC HALF THE SIZE OF MY PALM! Not only is it the most disgusting thing ever, it is a serious health hazard. I COULD HAVE CHOKED ON THAT! I went to the store to ask for a refund and, with a lot of dirty looks and whispers between the employees, I got my miserable $2.49 back, but that does not, in any way, make up for the irresponsibility of the employees in checking that their machines work properly and are CLEAN. On top of everything, now that I&apos;m back home, I can hardly swallow because my throat is so sore. I&apos;ll probably have to visit a doctor soon... And poor them if I have any kind of illness, virus or bacteria, because they will CERTAINLY be hearing from me. Who knows what McDonald&apos;s put in my drink?

 Kim Burnette 7/3/12 
 My experience was so awful. Stood in lobby for 6 minutes before even being recognized because the cashier was too busy talking to her friends who were in line before us. The cashier told her friends she was waiting on hot fries and she would bring them to their table. Then we got our order, and the old fries that we&apos;re good enough for her friends - which I then had to take back. My Big Mac was so cold I couldn&apos;t eat it so i took it back as well. I had to wait nearly TEN minutes to receive another sandwich - which was somehow exchanged instead for a mcdouble MADE like a mac! I was furious, but didnt want to chance waiting so long for my bigmac I had originally paid for. The entire time this is happening, the manager who was walking around and talking with his friends in the lobby did NOTHING to speed up this process - OR APOLOGIZE even when I brought it to his attention and asked for my receipt-which he gave me almost woodlessly.So unprofessional. His name is Dustin, which I heard another employee call him. He, nor many other of the employees had nametags on. I was SO unimpressed with his &quot;management.&quot; I was also VERY upset at hearing Dustin cussing at the counter and lobby area while conversating LOUDLY with friends and other employees. The whole time I was in the restaurant I was impressed by one thing-an employee named Tara. I know her name, because she was wearing her nametag! She was keeping herself VERY busy even while the other employees and Dustin were playing around.

 Who&apos;s responsibility is it to call whom, between the store manager and employee, when the employee is suspended, for whatever reason? 



 Greg Tampa, Fl. 7/2/12 
 I attend Mc Donald at least 3 week. Tonight I was a concerned customer at this store location ; 920 e fowler ave, yampa,fl.,33612. I did not think that it was very right for the management to handle my concern of the employs to wear good gloves&amp;the manager that were handling that shift (around 7;30pm) to handle money&amp;credit cards,&amp;think they do not have to slide on a pair of gloves on to make a meal. I said my piece&amp;they did not take my concern very seriously. IF they gdanshandle food they should abide by sanitation rules as well.! Store # 1636 , July 2,2012.. Thank you.. Scan the video. 



 KL Bosco 6/21/12 
 In all my years of going to McDonalds, I have never been so PO as I am now. After having to repeat my order 4 times, the cashier still got it wrong. Not only did I not recieve what I ordered, I was overcharged but the most insulting event was &quot; She could barely understand ENGLISH&quot; Hello News flash, this America or it least it was last time I checked, if I cannot go to McDonalds in Southern California, Roubidoux and order my meal, in ENGLISH, where am I supposed to go?????? Is anybody listening??? Hello McDonalds are you listening, I want to order my food in the language of this great nation, that I was born in, in my primary language ENGLISH. I am going to copy and paste this to my facebook, maybe it will get someones attention, maybe, someone will care.....

 I rarely eat out and rarely eat McDonalds, so since I got off late from church everything is close and we were really hungry and decided to not eat at waffle house over McDonalds, which now I really wish we would of gone to Waffle House. I was really craving a shake. When I get to the window, mind you I don&apos;t eat out and rarely go to McDonalds, and I don&apos;t know the menu so i ask the representative if they have spicy chicken. With a smart attitude she responds, &quot;the menu is right in front of your face&quot; I completely ignore her, because I will be mad too if I worked at any fast food place. I went on with my first order and asked for sweet tea and she said they were out, so we order Dr. Pepper which later on we found out it was just water really it tasted really sour. I also order a Picachu toy for my sis. I went on with my order and again I don&apos;t eat out much and don&apos;t know the McDonanld menu, so I order a chicken sandwhich for my mother conscious that is not spicy and the representative goes &quot;you know that is not spicy right&quot; with an attitude and I advised yes I am aware also can I have the BLT chicken sandwhich.I also try ordering my shake but they said their ice cream is not coming out right or something like that. When I went to pay, there was no picachu even though they charge for it $1.69 and when the rep gave us the toy it was Dora and only gave me one sandwhich. I asked for the manager and the manager when I said I wanted picachu she said that is a boy toy, I don&apos;t care if its a girl or boy that&apos;s not what I asked. Also they did not register my mom&apos;s sandwhich. The manager just laughed and afer all the smart comments from the rep and rude! i explained to her I know she is probably having a bad day, but I did not asked her to work here and her job is to attend customers that is what she gets paid to do. WE left there very unhappy and wishing that we should of gone to Waffle House instead where the staff is much friendlier. We never got my mom&apos;s sandwhich and the Dr. pepper was very sour, it was probably mix with their attitude. The store is in Duluth, Georgia store #: 18870 I would never eat there again even if Im starving I will take my business elsewhere. I will really want something done about this, is not fair that I paid for some really sour food and bad service. 



 Very disappointed customer... 6/24/12 
 McDonald&apos;s in Startzville, TX @ Canyon Lake is a place I frequently drive through for breakfast. Today is the first time my husband and I decided to eat lunch in the dining area there in years and after today I will never support that location again. Unless someone can prove the employees are well behaved, trained on how to keep the place clean and the disgusting filth is gone. One staff was squirting another with a water bottle. One staff had some kind of stuff all on her shoulder another employee put on her and when she noticed it she dusted it off contaminating everything around her then started charging toward the employee laughing at her. The staff with the food or whatever on her shoulder told another staff member to go wash tables after I asked for someone to wash tables and chairs. That young man did as asked but it is obvious he has not been trained properly or wasn&apos;t paying attention when trained as all the stuff on the tables went onto the seats for guests to clean off themselves or sit on. I have never in my life seen a McDonald&apos;s this disgustingly dirty with staff so immature and disrespectful to the company and it&apos;s consumers!!!! I don&apos;t believe this location even deserves the one star posted as they deserve zero stars from my experience. 



 Bobby&amp;Laura Bergdoll 6/25/12 
 Stopped @ McD&apos;s in Battle Mountain, Nevada for 2/two $1. each any size coffee, FREE re-fills, as ADVERTISED nationwide&amp;on the windows of every McD&apos;s we stopped at driving across the country, and got that, EXCEPT for the Battle Mountain McD&apos;s who charged us $1.49 per drink&amp;then charged us .40 cents sales tax (6.85% NV sales tax) and would not let us have a FREE re-fill as advertised, the staff stated that &quot;This McDonalds is owned by California and the ADVERTISED $1. DRINKS DID NOT APPLY here&quot;, and then asked us to leave the parking lot while we were having our very weak, old coffee&amp;having a smoke in the parking lot, sitting in our vehicle, and even threatened to call the police on us if we did not leave immediately! I wrote a complaint at the McDonalds.com&amp;was told that the Battle Mountain McDonalds would call us. I had stated that I DID NOT want them to call me, only corporate. The battle Mountain called me anyways&amp;I stated that I DID NOT want to talk to them&amp;hung up&amp;they called me again. Figured I&apos;d put the same complaint in again&amp;this time they just called me 6 TIMES&amp;then did a &quot;prank-call&quot; ( have caller ID), I just can&apos;t believe the immature response that I have gotten from McD&apos;s&amp;they DO NOT CARE about ANY complaints at all. I will pursue this with the Nevada Sales Tax Commission for the excessive sales tax. I also just learned that the Battle Mountain McD&apos;s Supervisor/Manager is going to file &quot;harassment charges&quot; against my wife&amp;I, for registering a complaint! 



 Bobby Bergdoll 6/25/12 
 from the complaints here it sounds like McDonalds does NOT care at about it&apos;s customers/consumers! I&apos;d think it best for any/all to go the Google map, enter the address of the store&amp;leave a review there&amp;NOT through McDonalds at all. I didn&apos;t even see the complaint I wrote, yet... The best way to complain or bring attention is to just STOP visiting ANY McD&apos;s anywhere&amp;tell your family, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, enemies&amp;just about anybody, and go somewhere else, even if it is not convenient! I personally will NEVER EVER give them my hard earned dollars again! Jack In The Box has come out with Steak Burgers Menu&amp;is one of the BEST Burgers I have ever had! Try them&amp;you&apos;ll see&amp;I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a satisfied customer/consumer! 



 6/26/12 
 In regards to the McDonalds located in Charlotte , NC on Sunset, the manager is extremely rude. She did not give off a welcoming friendly vibe to the customers. In fact, her attitude was so nasty it caused me not to want to buy from that McDonalds any further. I thought it was to be believed that you hire those who are able to give off a good attitude to the customers in which they feel safe and comfortable to eat at the restaurant but, i did not feel either or. I suggest that she the manager of that Subset needs to get confronted to about her manner, its obvious no one has spoken to her about it before because today she was artfully rude.

Thank You, Your Customer. 



 Jonah 6/26/12 
 Is it the practice of the Mcdonalds franchises to NOT hire a person that does not have a bank account? My daughter went to an orientation at the Colorado franchise and was denied employment because she did not have a bank account. She why and was told that it is mcdonalds practice to do direct deposit only. If a person is looking for job, how are they suppose to have a bank account? I am not pleased with McDonalds. 



 Tat 6/26/12 
 McDonalds deserve no stars at all since they are nothing like how it use to be back in the 80&apos;s when their Big Macs were Big and their Chicken was far from processed. Not only their food is horrible but their Customer service as well. The employees including managers are extremely unprofessional and will talk nasty to you if you tell them that they messed up your order. This kind of attitude that the employees/ managers gives, will make you are afraid to open up your mouth to let the know that your order is wrong. One day my friend went to the McDonald and the assistant manager dropped juice on her pants leg and instead of the assistant manager apologizing and getting napkins to wipe down her leg. She ran for a mop and started moping with the floor with no apology. When my friend requested papertowel the assistant manager sighed and made a smart comment towards my friend. My friend was livid because she didnt expect that kind of attitude from an assistant manager. The manager came around the counter and stood right in my friends face to say a few nasty words to her. This is why I dislike MCDonalds and choose other fast foods franchise, instead. 



 N/A 6/27/12 
 I was employed by McDonalds in Dothan AL. I called out due to a funeral for a church member and freind of the family and was told that i had called out two Saturdays in a row and that i was terminated. I had only called out once before for a medical reason in which i brought a doctors excuse in on my next work day to prove where i was. If thats how your company works then i will not be buying food from your company ever again.

 I was hunger so my family and I choose Mc Donalds to eat for lunch.Time was 11:30 and I arrived to the Mc Donalds located on 9131 w florissant, fergunson mo 63136. I order 2 mc doubles 1 without cheese, 2 big macs and 4 small fries. Made it home, and the kids and I was enjoying our food. My daughter ran out of her room crying because she had pulled a humann finger nail out of her mouth. The finger nail was planted on the mc double and I dont know if was on purpose or if was an mistake but how disgusting is it to be chewing on your burger you feel something hard in your mouth and you pull out somebodys fingernail. My daughter will not eat and has not eaten for two days now due to that. I finally got her to eat but she literally wanted to cook her own food or watch me while I cooked her food. We will never eat Mc Donalds again, my daughter is 13 years old and when she grows up to have children, it will be ashamed that her children will never be able to experience a HAPPY MEAL....

 anonymous 5/3/12 
 Let me ask you this. Is it LEGAL for a franchise to borrow money from their safe to give to the employees and on payday take out $5.00 for every $20.00, cash your check without you signing it AND/OR being in the presence or anywhere near the check and charge you $3.00 to cash it right on the spot. 



 Paula 5/27/12 
 I would give a zero but that score was not available. I go to Mcdonald&apos;s on a regular bases granted it is usually a different store, but this one on 370 and 36th street has to the worst. Went there to get chocolate milk shake and get pies in a Mcflurry have had it done at other McDonald&apos;s since their way of thinking is customer is always right and never gave any issues. Wanted to ask the manager on duty about the refusal but the manager refused to come to the window. Is this the way McDonald&apos;s trains their managers to handle customer concerns. Very disappointed in how the manager did not want to explain to us why the refusal. No I do NOT want coupons I want this man trained on how he is to acted as a manager. Thank you for hopefully fixing this issue.

 I visited your restuarant located in Olympia Fields, IL on Lincoln Highway. I ordered two happy meals, two large sweet teas, 1 meduim cherry blast, 1 mccchicken, and 1 small fry. When I got home and began to eat my meal, as I was eating my fries, I reached in my fry bag I found gum that had been chewed, wrapped up in paper. I looked for my receipt in the bag and they did not give me a receipt, so I had to go online and get the number for this location, 708-747-8175. I called that number numerous times and no one answered the phone. I was so disgusted and enraged that not only did I find someone&apos;s chewed up gum in my food, not knowing if this person has any diseases that I could possible catch/have caught (by now), that this store also does not answer the phone. So, I had to drive all the way back to the store to report the fact that some disgusting worker your company has working for them, negligently chewed gum in the kitchen (which is against IDPH and JCAHO rules and regulations), then they nonchantly and without care just tossed the gum wherever not caring or thinking about the customers and their safety. I keep thinking what if my nephew or niece (1 and 5 years old, respectively)got a hold of the fry bag and chewed that wrapped up gum. It is something very sickening and scary to think about. I am worry that i don&apos;t catch anything or wondering if this person has aids you nerver know and now my mother is worring about me.

 I am an employee, I worked at McDonalds since Jan 1, 2012 but the hours the managers printed out for me tonight only had me from March 20, 2012. They&apos;ve deleted my hours. 79 days. I had have worked hard CHILD LABOR at 17 during school, and working &apos;till 12 waking up at 5 am to be at school. They screwed me over. I image how many times I&apos;ve gone in (EVERY TIME THEY&quot;VE CALLED ME IN ON DAYS OFF) That they have deleted outta and probably not paid me for. I am getting a lawyer to check into all of this and I&apos;m going out on this. I feel used and taken advanaged of as a minor/employee. I may not know everything but my lawyer will know exactly how to handel this cause i don&apos;t care how much it costs me but I&apos;m doing this for myself... This is wrong, and un perfestional of a business to do to a young lady for her first job. I have worked hard never been writen up, came in on days off when they needed help, stayed later then when i was suppose to to help out, and not because I wanted to but told I had to. I can not handel it. They say in the hand book no tattoo showing, no exotic piercing, and dangly ear ring, fake hair, exc. but yet most employees in Sparta, TN McDonalds are braking these rules, and probably many more. Most workers and managers wont pass a drug test. Heck you find more pill resadue on the baby tables in both mens and womens bathroom. They told me when I was being interveiwed that I would have to able pass a drug test. But yet NEVER tested me for anything still. I can&apos;t not even tell you what it is like to work behind the counter at McDonalds. They call their Crew members on the table dogs, treat use like crap, tell us to work work work , and clean when we&apos;re not doing anything but yet they sit down for 3 hours and still get paid. Having other people from different McDonalds working when they don&apos;t even say anything to this person, he comes in and comes behind the counter and don&apos;t work here. He works in Crossville, TN. I do not believe the things that have happened here since day one when I started. I thought at first it was a good job. But now I think it is pointless to try to even get a job there. The employees cus out loud in front of customers and don&apos;t get writen up. I am really unhappy and sueing for all my hard work that they didn&apos;t pay me for and cut and erased hours that I&apos;ve worked I deserve my money as a 17 year old who worked and went to school from Jan. on. I am following threw with this. And I hope they get caught and I hope that after this they take their job more seriously then they have. Also there are people on gril that touch food with no gloves on, as well as not washing their hands, droping the fry scooper on the floor, and because he didn&apos;t want to walk to the back and wash it or get another one he put it back after hitting the ground, top it all off if something is wrong if a customer wanted no pickels or something like that to their sandwich they will just take it off. Leave sandwiches sitting there for over 3 hours then throw them away. This makes me sick and not want to eat there. Unless I make it myself FRESH. wich we are not alloud to but everybody does anyways, because the managers don&apos;t care. I&apos;m telling you this so you can see/hear how McDonalds in Sparta, TN is abusing their employees/customers all of this is true and wrong. I have proof to give to my lawyer. This should be enough said, for action to be taken on your half for making this company look bad, seriously. And yet this is just a little of what all goes on and what I know. I&apos;m sure that others that work there can put their two cewnts in as well on top of this, if its the same as I&apos;ve said, or worse they&apos;ve got their problems and stories of what goes on there. Please try to better this place. 



 Kim 5/4/12 
 I recently had a horrible experience at the McDonalds in Nashville, Illinois. The place was filthy and the teenage workers were ineffecient and I know if health officials would have walked in and experienced what I did, the store would have been shut down.

One example I will share is that when a little girl(customer)lost her stomach on the floor next to the counter, a worker from the kitchen came out with a mop and bucket and said aloud &quot;My manager told me this was my job&quot;. She then proceeded to slop the mop in the water and slop it down on the floor without ringing it out. The water - along with the upchuck splashed onto another customers pantlegs. This mop was continued to be used in other areas of the resteraunt - no ringing and no cleaning of the water so therefore contamination was spread throughout.

Please investigate this McDonalds Franchise location as this should not be the experience of such a large and well reputed chain.

Thank you. 



 Luke T. 5/6/12 
 Sigh...I&apos;m so unlucky. First location gives me old fries...you could tell its old by how starchy its texture is when you chew them, and how its not barely warm. Second location gives me warm fries (how would be so much better), but only 3/4 full. I hate myself for sometimes having cravings for their fries &gt;&lt; 



 Michael Wright 5/21/12 
 I&apos;ve been a regular customer of the Rancho Cordova. CA 95670 Mcdonalds for over 20 years I&apos;ve been buying breakfast on a regular basis at least five days a week some times as much as seven days and all this time I&apos;ve been ordering the same thing the sausage mcmuffin two for three and large mocha frap with extra chocolate drizzle and a sausage Bisquit with a round egg instead of a folded one and a Mrs frdr. Pepper and they have always charged me 11.73 well today I went in and they only charged me 9.15 so I&apos;m like you made a mistake it a always 11.73 so she double checked and triple checked and manager on duty checked and come to find out I&apos;ve been paying an extra 2.56 every time I buy breakfast and I go at least at least 5 days a week that adds up to over 600 dollars a year that I&apos;ve over paid McDonalds :( 



 Sandra 5/22/12 
 The McDonalds in Sunrise and Lauderhill are worst places to eat in or out. They never get your order correct and make it so bad, McDonalds in Lauderhill charges 75 cents for sauces. This is the reason why I&apos;m eatin from Burger King cause the quality of there meat and it&apos;s not dry. Now summer time is coming and I hope these Resturant get it together cause of the flies. McDOnalds, get it together now cause I miss my number combo 3 large meal. 



 Patrick 5/8/12 
 Went to McDonald&apos;s at our local Walmart and was surprised to see a memo on the counter that directed employees that they could not look at their schedule on company time. Really McDonald&apos;s? If that is the case then managers shouldn&apos;t be able to make the schedule on company time. Get your act together. 



 Scott Kummer 5/9/12 
 I&apos;m glad to say that I&apos;ll NEVER go to one of you places EVER again!!! It would be very different if your employees cleaned the place up or heaven forbid speak English so I can be sure to get the item&apos;s I&apos;ve ordered. I&apos;m so sick and tired of having to go back and actually fight with the Hispanic help you seem to love so much to have them fix their mess up! I&apos;ll be very sure to pass on my experiences to EVERYONE I know and truly hope you go out of business!!! 



 Marie 5/11/12 
 I have to wonder about the above complaints. Many don&apos;t use any periods and very poor grammar (Ericka, but not just her), it is hard to follow the stories with these run-on sentences. It doesn&apos;t matter that someone is a doctor wearing blue scrubs driving a Lincoln etc; what does that have to do with the story? Are you expecting better results and/or services because of your scrubs and MD badge? If you all have complaints about a particular store or franchise, learn to be concise and take it up with management. If they don&apos;t respond to your liking, then contact the corporate office and your public health department (food inspections) if it concerns health issues. If may be helpful to copy the local McDonald&apos;s you&apos;ve had issues with as well as your local BBB! 



 Janice Teal 5/11/12 
 I will never eat at another McDonalds if I can find ANY other palce within 10 miles. 



 sandra 5/11/12 
 i went to mcdonalds in mitchell south dakota they were the most spectacaular place ever i was there when they were busy and i had the best customer service from a young counter man by the name of tyler he is such a nice a young man i think he deserves a raise or two. 



 Ana 5/11/12 
 I think it is pretty sad when you go the same McDonalds off and on and they just happen to slip your Card out of there hands as you give it to them to pay your bill, and they loose in the box that has donation money for the Ronald McDonald foundation but the funny is that they dont have a key for the box so now your card is in there not only are you out a card but there excuse is they can&apos;t get it. So now 48 hours later you are still waiting for someone to get your card. Wow really horrible service and to blame their own charity as the cause because they have no key. Something wrong with that picture. Maybe they think I have donated my card and in the process get horrible service from every Manager because of this McDonalds on March lane in Stockton 



 Lois Etete 5/14/12 
 Good day, sir/Madam
This is a suggestion about your breakfast menu, can you please add croissant with eggs and susage to the menu? Especially for those who do not like bagles or biscuits.

Your Loyal Oatmeal Customer. 



 we love ice cream too... 5/15/12 
 the same problem with the mcdonalds in natchitoches louisiana at both location ice cream machine is always not working and sometimes at the location on I-49 no soft drinks and a sign that says sorry we r out of nuggets. ur a billion dollar company who run out of food and buy a new ice cream machine. also customer service SUCKS,SUCKS,SUCKS.AT BOTH LOCATION. 



 Fatima 5/16/12 
 hi
well i went to eat inside Mcdonalds few years back and i noticed that the customer service, hygiene were very poor., The tables were very dirty and I didnt know where to sit...they were not wiped off..I was shocked...as its very famous fast foood...It was the first time i have eaten inside Mcdo ...well very disappointing...since then i never went to MCDO...but I have to say that the customer service is very good...u are provided food within few seconds...I now still order food at Mcdo but through the window...The foood is yum especially the milk shake...I am never disappointed by the wrong food served or expired ones.....sorry for guys who were served wrong or expired foods....welll i think that Mcdo should consider this if they want to succeed as hygiene is one of the main ingredient in attracting the customers.!

I would like to email you a photo of the unacceptable food I received tonight.If anyone knows where i can email the photo i would greatly appreciate the email address. I filled a complain on mcdonalds website but of coarse there is not option to upload a photo. my husband and i went through the drive thru of our local McDonalds in surprise az. When we approached the window to pick up our food they asked us what we ordered. I stated my order. We waited 11 minutes at the window with no one in frount of us and several cars behind us while they &quot;found&quot; our food. The woman apologized for the wait and we drove home. When we opened our food upon getting home our buns on all three burgers were burnt. The buns were black, not brown and very obviously burnt so I called the number off of our receipt and asked for the manager.Irene the manager took the call. I explained that my food was very burnt and the manger told me that we weren&apos;t the only one&apos;s food who were burnt and they were having problems with the bun toaster. I politely asked if they knew there was a problem why weren&apos;t we notified in the drive through with the option to cancel our order. She then proceeded to tell me that they weren&apos;t burn they were slightly over toasted. I explained that the buns on all three burgers were black and asked how that was justification to slightly over toasted. She proceeded to tell me once again that they were having problems with there bun toaster and that i could come back in and have them make me new burgers once there toaster was working correctly. The fact i could come in another time didn&apos;t solve my families problem tonight, that we were hungry now left with black, burnt to a crisp buns. I am extremely unhappy. Receiving buns that are black is not something that should be brushed off like our concerns aren&apos;t valid. 



 Sea 5/20/12 
 The store in fish hawk fl. Store number 26483 needs to train there employees to secure the lid on there hot coffee before they hand it to a costumer. I got to wear half a cup of hot scolding coffee. And the shirt I had cleaned and pressed for work is now destroyed. I had to go back home and change witch made me late for work and I&apos;m out one shirt. I am so angry with this store to be so careless. I am a regular at this store and always had problems but this is it. I will not go back to this stir location ever again. 



 Fern 4/26/12 
 I&apos;ve always liked their food, but the restaurants are dirty, from the tables to the restrooms. I can&apos;t help wondering if the employees wash their hands. 

 

 Alene Sullivan 5/2/12 
 I went into the McDonalds in Valparaiso, Indiana. The one located on Morthland Drive and was in total shock how filthy it was. My feet were sticking to the floor, the area by the pop looked like it hadn&apos;t been wiped up in a long time. The counter had dirt and food on it. Needless to say I didn&apos;t buy any food. I am not sure where to report how dirty this restaurant was on 5/2/12.

 McDonalds Brainerd rd Chattanooga tn 37411

Any one who has been to this McDonald&apos;s understands what I&apos;m complaining about. The only reason I went to this specific one is because I live close and was tired after work. I figured since the last three times my order was wrong-then surely it wouldn&apos;t be this time. Ya right!! I ordered a fish sandwich n a sweet tea -simple enuff- well when I got home my fish had ketchup on it and my tea was unsweetened The guy at the window looked confused n sneaky moving in slow motion because he was scared he may have to make some. The employees are so rude there. It&apos;s like bizzaro world The don&apos;t even speak they mumble low &quot;takeyaowda&quot; I hate this place! While they make your food the girls up front go to back to loudly &quot;giggle&quot; wich makes you real comfortable that your not eating floor food. Uhhggg I hate this place. Oh ya. I called got out on hold 10 min then they hung up on me. Called back-- phone was off hook busy. Never go here there&apos;s a burger king sonic Krystal rite down rd. keep driving!!!! 



 Melissa S. 4/30/12 
 I live in Dalton Ga.&amp;the manager @ our East walnut Ave. McDonalds name Amanda screamed&amp;cursed @ me 2 nights ago on the 28th of April 2012............I have filed a formal complaint but worried that she will still get to keep her job that she should be fired from............The way I feel is she would be fired on the spot if she cursed @ another employee or upper management, so why not get the same punishment for treating a customer so disrespectful............
 



 SpeechlessinWA 5/1/12 
 My daugthers happy meal contained 5 french fives (no an issue because she doesn&apos;t eat them) but really tacky. Then we open her apples, they are brown and mushy. I waited in line to exchange them. The next package was expired but I thought since it was only a couple of days no harm. I was wrong!! They were slimy, smelly, and tasted horrible. The response from the employess including a blank stare from the manager was, shoulder shrug with not my job to check them. They didn&apos;t even offer another replacement. I took pictures of the apples, fries, and reciept together.

Should have just bought lunch at the grocery store since we had to go and buy an apple anyway. What has happened to customer service? 



 Ericka Shalon Ray 5/1/12 
 I visist Mcdonalds today 5/1/2012 the service was poor to my understanding it was already several customers returning orders because they could not seem to get the orders right well I return to Mcdonalds three times in one day because they left some of my order off the first time I went in told the manger I got all the way home and my burger which was a quauter pounder was left off, I order one 20 piece chicken nuggett, one 10 piece chicken nuggett, large order of fries, small order of fries and a quarter pounder well any how they left my burger off I tried calling they would not answer the phone I had my receipt and the whole order that they gave me when I return back to the store I order from I ask the manger after I told him he left my burger off could he do my whole order over because the rest of my food was cold he refuse to do it over and I told him well since it seems to be a problem could he just give me my money back he said yes after refusing to do my order over well I did not want cold fries and nuggetts and a hot burger I am a paying customer and it should not have been a problem to re do my order he gave me my money back and let me know he was not gonna do my order over so I got my money over went to the drive thru re order my food instead of him redoing the order he gave me the same cold food I had brought back gave me some greesy fries that he re drop in the fryer warmed up... I ask for the coroporate number and he refuse to give me that...I am very displease with the service I received in Anniston, Alabama 36201, 1901 Quintard Avenue..I do not know if he had throwed my food in the trash and got it out and rewarmed it but I took my half back and my husband kept his half and told me not to worry about it... When I took it back I did not ask for any money back I did tell the manger now you eat this cold ass food and keep the money I paid for the food.... 



 Dianne DeVore 4/16/12 
 Everyone needs to be aware that McDonald&apos;s is dropping its support of ALEC, the nations largest nonpartisan individual membership association of state legislators, with over 2,000 state legislators across the nation and more than 100 alumni members in Congress. ALECs mission is to promote free markets, limited government, and federalism throughout the states. McDonald&apos;s has chosen to be intimated by a coalition of extreme liberal activists run by a former Obama czar, Van Jones, who is a self-avowed Communist. This extreme activist coalition is in favor of big government and anti-capitalist and free market enterprise. Your boycotting of McDonald&apos;s will be a good way to show them just how free market enterprise can work against those who are for a communist / socialist government. Shame on McDonald&apos;s for being intimated by Van Jones and his Communist friends. 



 4/9/12 
 The McDonalds in Highland, California on BaseLine St always have a problem with their ice cream machine. It&apos;s always broken and takes weeks to fix. After being in a long drive thru we are told that the ice cream machine is not working and no sundays are available. Can&apos;t you post a sign so we don&apos;t get in the drive thru lane. Highland is always extra hot in the summer so why can&apos;t McDonalds put in two ice cream machine so when one breaks down they will have a back up. 



 Former employee 4/10/12 
 The McDonald in Newnan,Ga 58 Bullsboro Dr manager broderic hughes and shaketta black are the worst manager ever they play around and crack jokes on former employees behind their back its just ridiculous on how they treat customers and think everything is a joke the store would be so much better if those 2 were fired idk how many complaints have filed on broderic its to many to count but if those 2 were fired many of my co-workers would be satisfied. 



 Jen 4/11/12 
 I just went to the Mcdonald&apos;s In Saratoga Springs New york and they have a play area and the manager did not care if my kids got hurt. there was 3 kids there all with there shoes on. we had told them nicely they needed to take there shoes off. they did not so I said it again. well lets just say the mother of the 3 kids said that she was there mother she knows best and it was ok for them to have there shoes on. We went and got the manager on duty and she completly ignored us would not even say 2 words to us took the womans side after arguing she told the woman to make her kids take there shoes off than comming over and talking to us she yelled across the room and said make sure your kids keep there hands to themselves I am sorry but when your in a small space going past each other there gonna bump into each other. apparently one of my boys pulled on a coat probably trying to get the attention of the other child. if he did it on purpose than absoulty exspecially if it was going something which they were not. however the manager was rude very inconsiderate and she did not care if my boys got hurt or not. we said fine we will leave so that my boys did not get hurt the manager did nothing to stop us at all. she just let it go no im sorry nothing a new kid that just got hired there was the only one who apologized to us for the inconvience I will never take my boys back there again ever... 



 Odenton Resident 4/12/12 
 The individual above who posted on 3/30/12 about the McDonalds in Odenton is correct about it being horrible. In my 5 years of living here they have time and again proved how horrible of fast food establishment McDonalds can be. Continually out of food. I cant tell you how many times I have gone there and they are out of both burgers and chicken nuggets...yet still remain open for some reason.

On a second note the employees need to be retrained on manners not to mention their overly judicious use of Mayo. I have to continually scrape off tons of mayo from all of my food. Mayo is used on burgers just to prevent the fats from the burger from soaking into buns. It should not be the same thickness as a burger...every time.

I have grown up eating at the McDonalds in Olney MD as well as the one in Beathany Beach DE and have never run into the issues that this restaraunt continually dishes out. The corporate HQ should really consider doing an audit of this restaraunt and its practices because it continually give McDonalds a black eye. 



 Nichole Garland 4/12/12 
 This is in regards to the McDonalds on West Market Street in Johnson City, Tn. I went through drive through today (April 12,2012) around 2:43 and after I returned home I found my order to be wrong. I had ordered a Double Quarter special and the slip on top also said double but the sandwich was only a single. I called to complain and was told there was nothing they could do. The manager who called me back after I had to listen to an automated message and leave a message of my own was named Pat Hunt if I understood the recording right. I asked for the owners name and she refused to tell me until I reminded her that I was sure there was a sign hanging in the store that had his name on it and then I was told his name was Jim Davis. When I searched it the only name I found was a John Davis so I am still unsure of the owners name. I assume if she thought she was doing her job correctly (which she was not) then there would not have been any problem giving me any names. She was very rude. I worked at a McDonalds as a kid and I know times have changed but it was very different then( I am not that old). We were not rude to our customers and we could also count pieces of meat. A person like her should not be in the position she is in. Sometimes I think they should take a few from the top and start them back at the bottom so on the next ride up they may learn some manners and how a business runs. She wanted me to bring the sandwich back to McDonalds and have her fix it. The way I see it with gas at $4.00 a gallon they should have to bring me another sandwich. I was headed to work after I spent a few minutes with my family, that was the whole point in stopping at a FAST food restaurant to eat. If they had gotten it right the first time there wouldn&apos;t be a problem then I have some woman getting hateful with me over their mistakes. If someone would like to contact me about this matter my e mail is j.nphillips@ yahoo.com. Please feel free.. Thank You..

 Theresa Malone 3/30/12 
 This is in reference to the McDonald&apos;s Store #10062 in Leeds, Alabama on March 30th, 2012. I live approximately twelve miles from this location, but was in the area picking up a prescription for my Mother. I went through the drive thru and ordered 3 big breakfasts, 2 bacon, egg and cheese biscuits, 4 orange juices, extra bacon on two of the big breakfasts. One Ice Coffee. I get home ONLY to discover that ALL orders were NOT correct at all. I was charged for everything, but I only received ONE bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. There was extra bacon on one big breakfast, but that same breakfast was missing the pancakes and a hashbrown. The biscuit had been split and there was a huge greasy spot in the middle of the biscuit where a sausage patty had been. One of the big breakfast was suppose to have two sausage patties, but only had one. Two of the big breakfast had RAW eggs and the biscuits were very gummy. They were not quite done. We were given NO straws with our large orange juices nor were we given any napkins. I tried to call the restaurant, but on three different tries, somebody would just pick up and then immediately hang up. They would never even acknowledge it was a McDonald&apos;s. This has been the absolute WORSE service I have received any where!!! 



 Stacy Kreutz 3/26/12 
 I had the pleasure of going through a McDoanlds drive-thru just recently. I found that the cashier did not give me my receipt, so I could not call the store to make a complaint. So I kept the item of food until morning and had to go out of my way to bring the item back to the store in the morning. I was greeted in a somewhat friendly way as I asked to speak with a manager of whom the whole crew was standimg in the front of the store. I posed the problem top the manager. I ended up handing him a baggy that I had placed the 4 piece chicken nugget and extra surprise (an ant) in it to him. Not wanting to inform the rest of the customers of the situation. He proposed an explaination to me that they have pest control and that they are resonsible to take care of the situation. Then he asked for my receipt, I told him that I was not given one so he then offered to replace thwe item of food at a later time since they where only preparing breakfast at that time. I kindly said no thank you, and said I would prefer not to eat any more food from that restuarant until the problem had been solved. Honestly I would have just simply appreciated the cash back for the item. But this really makes me take a step back to realize that I don&apos;t know the persons handling the food in which I am about to eat. And could only hope that nothing this gross has ever happened before or will ever happen again. 



 SB 3/24/12 
 Store 14702 Carrollton,TX. On 3/23, I purchased my usual Medium sugar free vanilla iced coffee in the drive thru. Upon receiving it, I noticed it looked smaller than usual. Now this is the 3rd time this has happened in 3 months. Since I was on my way to work, I did not stop. This morning (3/24) I decided to go inside and talk with a manager. She explained that it of course was the wrong size container and said she was sorry. My complaint now is; she just stood there looking at me... and finally said &quot;so&quot; with some attitude. I was actually shocked and answered &quot;I wanted to bring it to your attention&quot; and gave her the cup and walked out.I was prepared to order a breakfast and another sfv iced coffed but I figured I spend a minimum of $500 a year at this store and I can&apos;t believe when a customer comes inside to bring a small situation to a manager&apos;s attention that she didn&apos;t even offer to fix me a new drink. Now rude and terrible customer service. It will be awhile before I return to 14702 store, if ever./ 



 Jennifer 3/24/12 
 In my teenage years I worked for a fast food establishment. There is where I absolutely learned ethics and how to handle customers including customer complaints along with proper responses to them. Earlier this week my family an I stopped in for a quick meal at a local McDonald&apos;s, unfortunately there was a major issue. Usually coming from experience when there is a problem at a fast food place I do not raise a big stink as I have unfortunately been graced with that pleasure and I wish it upon no one. But this time i had no choice I ha never in my life been so disgusted and improperly taken care of. We order thru the drive thru and took our meal home. We all took our items and sat in the living room to eat. Upon eating my fries, a few were mushy but when buying into them to my surprise I tastes and had stuck in my tooth a chunk of a hall cough drop. Upon the next disgusting unmentionable things I could say ...... I called the store the next morning to speak with the owner as I know the one I went to is a franchise and my neighbor use to be a manager there. The owner could only offer me the following..... The first guy asked if i kept it 0.o &quot;no sorry i wasnt worried about saving it&quot;...He will investigate this, and offered me two free meals... Alright for one.., how does one investigate who had a cough drop and apparently coughed on the rack of fries thawing for two... Do I really wish to eat there again? Now mind you if I get some sort of disease or really Ill from whatever ailed this person, what would they do? One say I have no proof, sorry I ate it then threw it up, two I wouldn&apos;t Be ableto sue them for anything at all... What if this person had aids! I think I need more then a free meal. 



 Dr. Walter 3/22/12 
 You need to picture this, a physician in blue scrubs with ID driving a Lincoln goes to an empty McDonalds to speak with the manager. We provide lunch for the staff and at times they have chosen the local McDonalds franchise in West Chicago., IL. I have read these recent reviews and do agree that there is something definitely wrong with the dining experience. Incorrect orders the majority of the time and a wait staff that seems be lacking in the customer service department. Wrong food, undercooked, missing items, chew marks that appears to be from a rodent in prepackaged items, etc... I contacted them on several occasions and attempted to alert them to these situations and was told I was speaking to a manager. We will send you some free meal coupons and completely oblivious to what I was trying to share with them. Today, I made a brief stop during a time when the parking lot and drive-thru were vacant. Prior to ordering coffee, I requested to speak with the manager. Pull up to the first window was their response. Okay let&apos;s give it a try. Did as instructed and had a &quot;manager&quot; speak with me and was asked if they could take my order. (LOL!! and I did). I was not ready to place an order and I attempted to explained the above situation as I thought I was trying to help. The young lady mumbled something and said let me get the manager. I thought I was talking to the manager? This big middle aged guy with a tie comes over to this tiny window, introduces himself as Terry and asks if he could take my order. Are you the manager? I inquired. He replied Yes. I told him that the last person said she was the manager. ( Me still smiling.) I&apos;ve got lots of managers was his reply. Again, no one in the drive-thru and no one in this fast food restaurant. After briefly attempting to explain to Terry the above quality control issues that we had experienced, I thought that perhaps he would fein at least some interest and not want to launder his dirty linen in public and possibly invite me in to have a more private discussion. He would like to pay for my food. Again laughing, I said that I was not ready to place an order and didn&apos;t know if I was going to. Maybe I was too far from his reach, but it seemed that he was not happy with this discussion and I felt that he would have liked to thrown his business card at me rather than squeeze his frame through that tiny window to give it to me. He made it clear that we could contact the corporate office. I was very polite and pleasant throughout this visit. Maybe he thought that he was being disrespected when I laughed and am glad that I was not employed there. Had the girls look up the corporate number called and they wanted to record the call and share the experience with the manager at that location. I declined and found this all very amusing. Thank goodness for higher education. My advice stay in school, be polite, but don&apos;t laugh when you see the unfortunate hierarchy of a franchise gone awry. These are people doing a job and I wish the best for them.

 i see all these comments on here and its shocking. the mcdonalds i work at has similar issues with the whole hispanics thing. they dont speak to much english but they do get the majority of the orders right. the mcdonalds i work at is like any other restraunt when it comes to orders. some times orders get messed up. especially when we are busy. but our crew and management arent rude at all. especially not to the customers. 



 Stephanie 3/17/12 
 Just the other day i ordered a Mcdouble and small fry. Well when i bit into my mcdouble there was long hairs in it. Now i took my meal inside and showed it to the manager on shift. She just laughed and said I am sorry . Now my husband works here and that same manager is being really hard on him and picking favorites. She tells him he is to slow for the job and being rude towards him. I do know alot of the people who work there and most of them are related to her. But is there not a law against chooseing favorites or being rude or having hair in my food that is not soposed to be there. I am almost 8 months pregnant and dont think i deserve rude managment or rude service or anything of that nature.

 I like McDonalds generally. Recently McDonalds started offering &quot; chicken mcbites&quot;. The first time I ordered them they were great. Fresh, chicken was moist all white meat. Nice sized bites. So I went back on another day to this time to my local McDonalds in Neosho, Mo. The pieces were tiny and only 5 or 6 of them actually had chicken inside. The rest were just breading and hard. I went thru the drive thru and did not time to go back. I thought maybe it was a fluke. They were really good the first time..... So like a fool I went to McDonald this afternoon and ordered some Chicken Mcbites and it was same thing. The pieces were all nickle sized and hard with no chicken inside. I GOT TWO ACTUAL PIECES WITH CHICKEN INSIDE. We went on down the road and on our way back went thru the drive thru and showed the employee. She said&quot; they all look like that&quot; I said they have no chicken in them and are like rocks and size of buckles. So she got a snotty attitude and said she could make some but it would be 4 minutes. At this point my husband looks at her and said we will come back tomarrow. His reasoning is this- she lied to us and said the chicken is always bad. Secondly her attitude was offensive. We will not interact with rude people. We do however to get what we pay for. McDonalds you really failed. No she did not offer our money back on the item or a coupon even. All we got was a bad attitude from her and no chicken. :(

 McDonalds at 35 Forsyth Street in Atlanta, GA: my experience on March 5, 2012: FAIR

I work across the street from this McDonalds. It is convenient but I always dread coming here because the lines are always long and slow-moving. Typically, the cashier will announce which lines are cash only, but that is after one has waited
a long time in line. Why not place a sign by the register? Between waiting in
line, getting my order, and back to the office took 28 minutes. Part of that time was because I was in the wrong line (cash only) and had to move to another line.


I think the cashiers and staff could use time-management and training
for dealing with the public.

It was chaotic yesterday, very disorganized, people were frustrated and people leaving w/o ordering anything. This is the most disorganized McDonalds I&apos;ve
ever been to.
 



 Danny Hearod 3/5/12 
 I had the unpleasure of visiting Mcdonalds in Tunica Mississippi,I walked in about 10:30 pm one night,As I waited for the employees who were serving other customers which were a few,I was singled out as a WHITEMAN and subjected to rude and public humilation and racial denial,I was rejected to be served in the resturant and was told to go through the drive thru.I contacted Mcdonalds Corperate office and was given the OLD PASS THE BUCK syndrome.They did want to do a darn thing except pass the buck,One man who works for their resturant management over the whole northern state ,told me how sorry he was an was going to turn this over to the insurance dept for a resolution because of the facts ,and that he could not offer me more than a Mcdonalds food card,Hell Thats why I was there,to eat,I had my own money,But again after being patient and writing them over an over,I have come to conclusion that ,Im going to have to take this to the courts,Now If I would have been a Blackman or a black woman,This in fact would have been taken more seriously.I am Not by no means a Hater of different walks of life ,But when your singled out and done they way they done me,I strongly believe that they,Mcdonalds, DONT GIVE A DAM ABOUT PEOPLE RIGHTS OR HOW THEY WERE TREATED... 



 Your Company Employees Suck 3/5/12 
 I just started to go to McDonald&apos;s again after a long time. I started going for a breakfast sandwich and a coffee. I always give the correct amount of change and what ever whole dollar I have on me. The employee who took my money gave me incorrect change and when I told her about it she denied it. I pressed the issue, asked for the manager. She refused and shut the window on me. I also have problems with them ALWAYS getting my order wrong. I do like your fish sandwich. I always order without cheese. One of the McDonald&apos;s on Airport Rd. gave me a sandwich with no fish and it had &quot;special sauce&quot; on it with a side of &quot;special sauce.&quot; When I order my fish sandwich from the 11th St. McDonald&apos;s it is always marked No Cheese, but has cheese. I ordered a quarter lb. hamburger a few days ago from my normal McDonald&apos;s and it was marked Hamburger but had cheese. Yesterday I ordered a double hamburger with mustard and onion only and it was marked mustard and onion only. Except when I got home it had katsup, pickles, onion on it. I called the manager of the McDonald&apos;s because I&apos;d had enough. It is obvious your employees don&apos;t care about whom they serve. Why should they? You don&apos;t impress upon them the importance of making the customer happy. All you care about is making money. As for your &quot;diverse&quot; workplace, I would suggest you make sure the people you hire can read and speak ENGLISH properly. Ebonics and Spanglish are Not English. As for READING what a person wants on their sandwich, it isn&apos;t that hard. On another note. I will Never be returning to McDonald&apos;s again. Cheap though it may be, your restaurant had really gone down hill since you lost sight of the customer. 



 Margaret 3/1/12 
 I live in Coffeyville, Kansas and have enjoyed eating at McDonalds. The food is always good, my complaint is about 2 of the employees. They are bashing my daughter on facebook and telling us not to come into mcdonalds. The other evening we went into mcdonalds to eat, my daughter did not say a word, and I placed our order. As we were walking out one of the employees called her a name. We just kept walking and left. Since then they have called her names on facebook and told us not to come into mcdonalds. I don&apos;t employees should treat customers like this. I complained to the main manager and she would talk to them but on facebook today they just laughed and said we tried to get them fired but it didn&apos;t happen. The names of the employees are Aliyah Johnson and Samantha Carter. In my opinion they do not represent good employees for mcdonalds. My daughter has been diagnosed with PMDD and they are really aggrivating the whole disorder. Please take care of this situation, we would really like to eat there without having a problem.
 



 fitUpAmerican 2/22/12 
 Why is it that when i go into a McDonalds to order or get a job application, noone speaks a word of ENGLISH!! When i order it takes like 2 or 3 people to get it right. Ugh it fustrates me im freakin hungry already. Im so fed up. I could do this job. But they wont give give me an application too. Not only does this happen at McDonalds it happens everywhere. Im a &quot;Native American&quot; from New Mexico, i hope the government does something about these &quot;immigration issues&quot; STAT!! Im hungry, i just want my Big Mac and a Job Application and i be out your way. Thank you 



 jamie 2/19/12 
 Every McDonalds in terre haute could careless about customer service or the quality of food they are giving out... cold raw sausage I am done with McDonald s til they decided to get new managers that care. They are dirty. 



 Diana 2/17/12 
 I have gone to many McDonalds retaurant and at all of them if you order fries through the drive through you are going to get a lot less fries in you box than if you go inside. Yesterday I ordered an ice tea with 2 equals, a hamburg and value fries. I got an ice tea with no equal, a cold hamburg and medium fries. There are mostly kids that only work there until they go to college or graduate college so they don&apos;t seem to care. However, someone needs to impress upon them that customer satisfaction needs to be learned and practiced to be used throughout their working life. I know someone that had worked at a McDonalds and since moved on that told that he knows the kids working at that one spit in the food and other horrible stuff. This makes you never want to eat in a fast food restaurant. Better supervision is the only answer that I can see.
 



 Kyle Lowder 2/17/12 
 I am employed at Mcdonalds on Miller Road in Flint, MI. I was told by the owner/operator that if I did not cut my hair off I could not return to work. I am one of three white people employed there, and I was told that I was in violation of grooming policy. I have read the grooming policy in the crew handbook that I signed, and spoke to a lawyer about it and I was not in violation of any policy. My hair was pulled tightly up, neat, and free of frizz or fly-away strands. I am also the only employee who wears a Mcdonalds hat. The other employees are allowed to wear their hair down, where it can drape into the food as they prepare it, granted the grill team do wear hairnets, the service and fry people let their hair go wherever.The owner/operator also makes rude, obsene, racist and discriminatory comments towards me and other employees daily. He curses at his workers in front of customers, and I believe he is the one in violation of Mcdonalds policy. I was informed that there is a form I can fill out for corporate to force him to surrender his franchise, or I can sue him for ownership over his franchise. I would like to avoid suing him, but if at all possible I would like to know how I can go about making him surrender his franchise. Because many of the employees are ready to quit, which will result in loss of a lot of business, because we service a lot of customers. We are one of the busiest stores in my area. 



 Shells 2/17/12 
 I am a current employee&amp;just want to say that I hate McDonald&apos;s for many reasons. 1st of all I am treated like a slave by the Spanish who control everything because I&apos;m white. The company is so corrupt going all the way to the area managers who oversee multiple stores. The are truely racist. Hiring their friends and family and promoting them before others who have more experience&amp;actually speak English. They steal like crazy and falsify inventory records. They let major exquiptment break down and refuse to fix it due to &quot;not having money in the budget&quot; for example the shake machine will break, the bun steamer or toaster and the frappe will always be broke. But they won&apos;t spend $ to fix because they want to keep their budget low. They don&apos;t care that the customer is getting stuff made wrong. The reason you get old food is because low level employees get threatened that they will be written up or terminated if their shift produces &quot;waste&quot; which is cooked food that can&apos;t be sold and must be written down for inventory. They must not have more then a certian dollar amount in wasted food, so they will sell you a burger (or whatever) that has been sitting around getting hard. The stores are dirty because they under staff to keep labor percentages down below a certian number. So if the manager keeps labor costs down they get their quarterly bonus checks. By understaffing they save money, get their bonus&amp;the crew employees are over worked to their breaking point therefore they are miserable (only making 7.00 per hour) so you get poor service from these people who have a chip on their shoulder and the crew are too busy taking orders to go wipe tables or clean restrooms. All of these practices are good only for the upper management lining their pockets with bonuses and making their budgets/numbers look good to their bosses but it makes customers suffer as well as the regular employees who can&apos;t keep up with the work load, are the ones who take the brunt of customer complaints and get yelled at by rude management. And most stores in my area at least are all run this way. Most managers in my area are transfered around to other stores and rotated around. Managers sit on their asses and don&apos;t watch what employees do so yes there are some bad ones that can get away with being rude, and there are many employees that don&apos;t speak English do no wonder orders are always wrong! It&apos;s like being in a world of chaos when I go to work, but no where else is hiring so I&apos;ve been stuck there since November of 2008. I&apos;ve seen so much coorupt &quot;politics&quot; in management and the majority of customers are rude because they come in with their minds already made up that they will have a bad experience So then the employee is rude in return. It&apos;s very sad. 



 anonymous 2/18/12 
 the manager in the enon, ohio store is rude to customers AND employees. i was in for breakfast a couple of weeks ago and she yelled at an employee very loudly. not only could i tell that the employee was embarrassed, but that just like me, the customers in line behind me could not believe that she would be that unprofessional as busy as it was at the time.
no one is perfect. but this is not the first time i have witnessed something similiar in that same store, with the same manager. 



 Former employee 2/14/12 
 As for the complaint on mccafe beverages I can shed some light as a former employee. Those machines need to be throughly cleaned nightly to protect against breakdown issues. I remember whenever we had a promotion for mccafe beverages there were always machine issues. It would be smart to have 2 of these machines in each store which would help spread out the workload between them, they are very breakdown prone machines! 



 Francesca Ingino 2/16/12 
 The McDonald&apos;s in St. Louis, MO on Chippewa&amp;Hampton has absolutely HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I am no longer going to that McDonald&apos;s because everytime I go my order is ALWAYS WRONG!!! That is absolutely ridiculous&amp;unacceptable!! You really need to have meetings with your staff at this location because they have lost ALOT of *MONEY* because they can&apos;t handle simple task&amp;they are rude... A manager&amp;her employee were both very rude&amp;snatched something out of my hand cause I said it was wrong... I hope since you are management maybe you can get your staff under control so people will want to buy food from there!! Thank you 



 Susan Provo 2/16/12 
 I would like to make a suggestion, My special needs boy saves alot of pop tabs to give to Ronald Mcdoanlds house. He feels very proud of it when he brings into Mc donalds resturants. Could you make a certificate for them in return. That would give others who do the same, if any . It would make them feel very spcial? I didn&apos;t know where to send so coperate offices get it. Could you direct it to the right place. It would mean alot Dusty especially. Thank you. If you can&apos;t please send me a e-mail to the right place Thak you. 



 Carol Zembry 2/12/12 
 I live in Charlotte, NC. In the last few weeks I have attempted to purchase any of the coffee specialties and the highly advertised hot-chocolate carmel drinks. On at least 6 different occasions, at four different McDonald&apos;s in this area, the &quot;machines are broken.&quot; I have inquired and was told that the machine had been &quot;down&quot; for two days at the last site and a part was ordered. The manager had no idea how long it might take to repair the machine.
This is POOR management on your part. You pay to advertise a product and then are unable to supply it to the public. For whatever the reason, there is no excuse for this shoddy implementation of a new product. You have failed to supply good machines, your staff has no idea how to use the machine correctly, or any number of other reasons - but people are NOT happy with McDonald&apos;s in our area. My orders are consistently WRONG. I don&apos;t get fresh foods - many times - and the restaurants and rest rooms are getting dirtier and dirtier. On Saturday, I watched as a big fat manager came from the back and chewed his staff in front of customers at a location in Charlotte (near the Home Depot and Hobby Lobby) I would liked to have said something to him as I was embarassed for everyone involved - but I decided to get my order and get the heck out of there. I will not go back. What is wrong with your corporation? This has been a steady decline in service over the last year. I am sorry for the employees. You give them inferior machines to work with OR you are not able to fix the machine in a reasonable amount of time. Have these employees been properly trained to operate the machines. WHY are machines all over the area broken? You make it very hard on your employees and you are NOT satisfying your customers. You will soon see that people will not settle for poor service and products and will give their business to someone else. I hate to see that happen. Please get some good management and don&apos;t expect new employees to solve these problems because someone talked rudely to them. Had I been employed by the manager I observed on Saturday, I would have not been very nice. I would have first of all - taken off my apron and attempted to stuff in in his big mouth. Then - I would have left him to get off his big fat rear end and HELP his staff. Our family was there together. None of us failed to notice - and we were NOT impressed. 



 BOB KRATZ 2/11/12 
 THE McDONALDS IN DOWNTOWN MASSILLON OH. HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST PLACE TO EAT, I ORDERED A DOUBLE QUARTER POUND MEAL AND GOT A SINGLE QUARTER MEAL. I DROVE BACK AROUND, TOLD THEM, GAVE THEM MY RECPT. AND THEY GAVE ME A 6pc CHICKEN NUGGET MEAL. MY WIFE WENT IN 2 WKS. AGO AND ORDERED A BIG MAC AND GOT ONE WITH NO MEAT !!! MAYBE THEY SHOULD DRUG TEST MORE OFTEN OR HIRE AFTER THE GIVE AN IQ TEST, BETTER YET, CLOSE THE LOCATION 



 Carleen P. 2/12/12 
 You should have a big O, no stars. Who owns the Mcdonalds on Gale Ave. in Hacienda/La Puente area ? they should be shut down. The food is never fresh, warmed over, and old, cold fries. It&apos;s nice to look at with it&apos;s fancy designs, Asian touches, but the food is non edible. Someone from Corporate Headquarters needs to stop by and sample the trash they are serving. I thought maybe it was just once in a while this happened, but I have gone many times to see if it&apos;s always this bad, and it is. 



 !@#$%%^&amp; 2/12/12 
 I DO NOT LIKE MCD&apos;S IT SUCKS THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME AT A DRIVE IN AND THE FOOD TASTES HORRIABLE AND I WAS YELLED AT FOR TAKEING TO LONG i was on the phone hold one on it waz only half a min so really i was given less cange and i bit into a big mac with bacon in it i mean i like bacon but seriously in my big m common my nebihor works for mcd&apos;s and he dosent know this my leomade frozen was thawde and so this is goning to stop 



 sidney lundin 2/9/12 
 is it company policy to present a hostile working and dining experience? Here in Jacksonville, Florida. The towncenter store, there is a rather disrespectful, potty mouth female here. I am asking for her termination of employment. I think she is in management. Thank you for your consideration of this letter. Plesse know it is illegal to present a hostil envirment in the work place. Thank you. 



 Darren the ripper 2/6/12

 Diana Davila 2/7/12 
 uumm are you really getting mad because they said that about a pitbull I mean their food is very delicious so I suggest you stfu:) 

 

 Michael Claypoole 2/7/12 
 This has to do with your Store #6461 at 1131 Aylor Rd, Stephens City, VA 22655. Store Manager #Kymm Stinedurf. I have been a regular customer of McDonalds for many many years and well during this last month have recently found out that your $1.00 coffee Ad both on TV/Radio and the sign in your window is false advertisement. I have been charged $1.49 for a large coffee and this has happened on many occasions and when I inquired on the price I was told that if the customer does not ask for the $1.00 coffee that McDonalds is suppose to charge full price. What kind of scam are you running. These are hard working and some out of work customers trying to get a deal and you ruin with your deceit practices. I have not yet to blog this or put this on facebook and was and have been waiting for the manager to call me or email me (Not as of today) but I can&apos;t believe this has happened but if I am the only one so far to catch this how many people are you taking advantage of. Does not your Corporate/Headquarters do surprise visits or audits of stores? I will give you a few more days to see how this store wants to handle this before i go to either a lawyer (i have receipt/s) and get the employees that work at McDonalds as my witnesses or go another avenue. I await a phone call or email. My work phone is 540-868-4501 Cell phone #540-421-2885. 



 antonio brown 2/7/12 
 majority of every mcdonals in Austin TX and pfugerville are racist.. They only hire mexicans we have been to several mcdonalds and all we see are mexicans.. what happend to hiring of every race.. there are no blacks, whites anything but mexicans..This is why there are no jobs in America and most people are eather homless or cant find work. you call customer service for phone companies its always people that speak other languages..this is pathetic.. mcdonalds should be sued 



 proud pitbull owner 2/4/12 
 Absolutely pathetic to use ANY breed for a safety comparison. How about

&quot;Safer than letting Michael Vick dog sit for you&quot;? Or &quot;Safer than a gun&quot;? Because like the pitbull, all guns are bad, right? Epic failure on the part of the McDonalds company. I&apos;ll be sending an email to your office with pleanty of unsafe pictures of my kids and
kitten with our &quot;viscous&quot; pitbull. 



 CParrish 2/4/12 
 I WILL NOT be eating at Mcdonalds, nor will I ever support the franchise again! Your ad about petting a pitbull being &quot;unsafe&quot; is pure ignorance and discrimination! I own 7 pitbulls and trust me petting one of my babies is much safer than eating your hard so called chicken bites! Quick question... where&apos;s the chicken???? Are we supposed to &quot;imagine&quot; the chicken?!?! I will be taking my business to any other fast food place besides your biased restaurants! Do everyone a favor and just close your doors!!!! 



 Really pissed Customer 2/4/12 
 You have just lost business from me and my family. That was rude and uncalled for. The breed of pittbulls are the most loving dogs they already have a bad reputation thats not true. For Mcdonalds to be this low and try to pick on a helpless animal is pathetic. All I have to say is im done with McDonalds and will be advertising what they have said about pittbulls.I hope you loose millions and go out of businees . Fuck you McDonalds. Fuck you 



 Carrie 2/5/12 
 Never again will I be taking my kid to McDonald&apos;s after their ignorant ad saying eating a chicken mcturd is safer than petting a stray pitbull. I have rescued 3 stray pitbulls and they are far safer than eating that crap. BOYCOTT MCDONALD&apos;S! !!!! 



 John 2/5/12 
 I was reading the posts about the pitbull add. I love pits and it&apos;s wrong for mcdonalds to single them out like that. However, to the person who said to look up stats on the most dangerous dogs and that pits are not at the top: you are wrong. Dogbites.org and gogbitelaw.com both have pits at the top along with rotts. I don&apos;t believe for one second that it&apos;s bc they are bad dogs. They are great. It is bc they are powerful dogs that are easily trained to fight. I say it falls on humans!!! 



 Susette Morrison 2/3/12 
 McDonald&apos;s new commercial stating that eating their chicken bites is less risky than petting a pitbull is apalling. My son used to get weekly happy meals for a treat. Not anymore, we will be giving our business to sonic, who loves the breed and are not run by ignorant jerks. 



 m hentz 2/3/12 
 Do you people even try the junk you try to bring to market? Your Mc no chicken tooth breaking bites really stink. What a rip off! Like Clara says, Where&apos;s the chicken? To say nothing of the fact they were so hard I was worried i&apos;d break a crown.
I plan to buy lots and return every pack for my cash back. Hit em in the wallet, I say! 



 Dawn kelly 2/3/12 
 I will never allow my kids to eat McDonald&apos;s ever again how dare you run an ad saying that your food is safer than petting a pit bull are you just plain stupid or what. This is why burger king is better than you they know better than to run a stupid ad like this I am furious about this I know you won&apos;t contact me&amp;I know you don&apos;t care but trust me you will when you start to lose customers like me. I think the star rating should be 0 for you guys. 



 glorya gilbert 2/3/12 
 I think the new ad for McDonald&apos;s chicken bites comparing the safety of eating them to petting a pit bull puppy is the sorriest stunt McDonald&apos;s has pulled. I hope the all dog owners who read this will take their business elsewhere. I know my family and friends will. My love for animals by far outweighs my love for quarter pounders or big macs. And the apology they gave on Twitter was the worst apology I&apos;ve ever seen. Get real. Your food is unhealthy and more dangerous than any pup. 



 Nikki beck 2/3/12 
 I have been eating McDonald&apos;s for years and I really enjoyed! The stores in Carrollton ga are clean and the people are friendly but I refuse to eat at a McDonalds any where from now on! See I am a pit bull Owner and I am discussed at the radio commercial that was aired saying that your new chicken nuggets are Safer then petting a pit bull! Really? If America would stop punishing the breed and start punishing the people who abuse them then most Americans would stop being afraid of them! But no America lets the drug dealer, dog fighters, and don&apos;t forget Michael Vick get away with hurting these dogs and then blames the dogs for the handlers actions! Sounds a little backwards to me! And it really makes me angry that someone with the power to promote the breed like McDonald&apos;s could do falls in with the rest of America and puts down the breed! Why don&apos;t you do some research on pit bulls! Go to google and type in good things pit bulls do! O while your at it google the statics on dog attracts and what breed is on the top of the list! Guess what it&apos;s not pit bullls! I will never eat McDonald&apos;s again and I will do everything in my power to stop as many people from eating at McDonald&apos;s also! 



 karissa m 2/3/12 
 in general, several mcdonlads in hot springs ar are rough and generally bad about getting my food to me, but not made correctly. there is one store #26633 though that has improved a lot to where i will eat there again. the employees seem to be geeting nicer and even smiling sometimes.
 



 From fairview heights mcdonalds 2/1/12 
 actually mcdonalds employees aren&apos;t even supplied gloves to use...
and mcdonalds managers treat the employees horribly, screaming in their face and not giving them any breaks when working a 8 hour shift.. so when your mad about your order, don&apos;t take it out on the crew member, because they probably can&apos;t even think straight due to hunger, and being screamed at and being told to make french fries from the time you get there til the time you leave, inhaling grease for that long makes you sick, especially on a empty stomach. BY LAW EMPLOYEES MUST GET A 15 MINUTE BREAK EVERY 4 HOURS OF WORK!! FAIRVIEW HEIGHTS MCDONALDS IN ILLINIOS IS BREAKING THE LAW AND TREATING THEIR EMPLOYEE&apos;S HORRIBLE. 



 2/1/12 
 In manning sc they are the rudest nastyist people they don&apos;t get any orders wright its all ways takesto for every to get even the simpleest food orders . Yall should burn it to the ground 



 joshua karnes 1/28/12 
 I have been going to McDonald&apos;s in warren ri for 25 years and the place has become dissapointing to say the least my father received filet o fish with no fish and my recent visit I got raw mc chickens raw u can get people sick or worst kill someone this is unacceptable by all means is anyone managing these stores WTF 



 Lee D. Booton 1/29/12 
 Having been a past McDonalds employee in 5 of Des Moines, Iowa McDonald&apos;s and evn working whit a man who started with the McDonald brothers at the original California first restaurant I think McDonalds is playing way to many games with its customers. What I mean by that is that it produces a product like the McRibb and puts it out for a limited time then takes it away till its sales are down or falling then brings it back out again. Just like you are now doing with the &quot;New Minnie Chicken McNuggets&quot;. You get folks hooked on a good product then take it away until you want them to return to you. Who do you think you are kidding? I as a 67 year old senior will not ever purchase your specialty products. If you can produce them once you can produce them all the time.

 I am a current employee at mcdonalds in baton rouge, louisiana. I was told when I started my job, I was going to be paid $8.25. I have been working at mcdonalds for about 3 months, and every pay check has been $7.25. I contacted the mcdonalds manager, he is doing nothing about it, and I also contacted headsquarters on south choctaw, they havent done anything about it. I work hard and I deserve to for my managers to at least pay me what they told me I would receive hourly. The economy is tough and I am hardly making it by all of the work I am doing. Please contact me via email at darianlegier@yahoo.com or call me at (225)287-6827. I do not know what to do!

 The fact that you are making African-Americans pay $1.50 automatically is the dumbest thing I&apos;ve ever heard. It&apos;s discrimination and is unconstitutional! If this doesn&apos;t stop I WILL SUE

 since I cant seem to get a person to talk to I guess this is my option posting on a board no one at McDonalds will read anyway, but here it goes. I just came from the store in Cartersville, GA in the Pilot truck stop. My order was pretty simple steak,egg,and cheese biscuit, a sweet tea, an a bacon mcmuffin. What I got was a ham mcmuffin, a tea that must have been made 6 weeks ago, an a bacon biscuit where if I hit someone with it I wouldve been charged with using a deadly weapon. Im sick an tired of mcdonalds obviously hiring lazy ignorant people! Do you not care what kind of product your selling anymore? The only thing I can say is well be spending our money anywhere but mcdonals from now on! 

 

 To the slime balls at mcdonalds 1/25/12 
 I cant beleive this bull crap. Your mcdonalds employees are not wearing their gloves when making our food. My Husband and I have eaten at the mcdonalds in lakesite and soddy daisy tn and both times weve been food poisoned. People are busy wiping their hads on their pants and touching our food!!!! Screw you mcdonalds. We will never eat there again. I am going to Burger King from now on. Atleast they know how to do things right. 



 Jennifer Arnold 1/25/12 
 We will no longer go to McDonald&apos;s do to the fact the play gym is removed. &quot;Upgrades&quot; for McDonald&apos;s could br done in a dozen other ways. It was the only excuse to eat over priced., fattening, cold, much less than delicious food. Yeh thank you! Goodbye McDonald&apos;s :) 



 1/24/12 
 Visited McDonalds in Lake City Florida on Highway 90. I am a gay. My name is Jessica Brooks. I am a person and wasn&apos;t treated that way. Before entering McDonalds my girlfriend gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. We were holding hands when the manager came flying outside to tell us that we were not allowed to touch because there were children in the building! A straight couple is allowed to hold hands or touch and we both felt really sad and hurt. It sucks to be called out and discriminated against. I&apos;m 25 in college and it&apos;s not like we were making out. Are all McDonalds against gays? I might just file a suit. I&apos;ve got a few friends that would love to handle this for me. 



 Gay Discrimination 1/24/12 
 I am gay. Although I don&apos;t look it my girl friend at times does. I&apos;m a college student at fgc. I visited McDonalds 01/22/2012 this last Sunday. Before we entered the building my girl friend gave me a hug and kissed my cheek...She then grabbed my hand and we startedc walki ng in. The manager rushed out to tell us that there were children in the building and that we weren&apos;t allowed to touch. Arn&apos;t straight couples allowed to hold each others hand in public? We both felt very hurt and something has to be done or the discrimination we face everyday in this town will never stop. Can someone please help us? 



 Hate McDonalds 1/21/12 
 The manager at the Mapledale McDonalds in Woodbridge, Va., berates the staff and does not give hours or cuts their hours and changes their schedule without informing them. Staff works, Alia Haq is a horrible manager and needs to get fired. The moral of the staff shows. She changes staff schedules without informing them and when they come in, she says they are late or not scheduled in. The Owner of that franchise has been informed and the Corporate office has been informed and the practice of this manager has been continuing.
One employee Shala Martin has not gotten hours in over 2 months and yet her name has been on the schedule.
Another employee who was awarded employee of the month Jaleel Jones has been demoted without cause and hours dramatically reduced. There are others and another former employee was working there for a month and a half without given a paycheck. Her mother had to come to the store to physically get her check and then quit the store.
 



 Sereiroth MEY customer at (4804) 1/22/12 
 I&apos;m a regular at this location and every time i go to the drive -thru and order, they would not fill up my fries , fill up my large drink more than half of the cup with ice and with less portion of beverage... 



 KRISTAL TORRES 1/17/12 
 Hello, my name is Kristal and I work for Complete Imaging Systems in Miami, FL and service one of the local McDonalds for office supplies,copier repair,toner etc. I tried to talk to the different purchasing managers the McDonalds office 305-661-0024&amp;305-670-7660 to offer them a cheaper/easier/and more money saving way to service their McDonalds but they hung up on me&amp;were rude! I&apos;m sure there are a lot of solicitors but I am not. I already provide great service to one McDonalds and was hoping to get an appointment to talk about our prices and services. Is there anything I can do? 



 John Sullivan 1/18/12 
 At McDonalds store #7375. Brookfield, CT I ordered my meal with little problems and sat down to eat.I noticed that i had a Mc.Donalds glass on my tray and stopped one of the workers and asked to why i had this glass and was told that it was complimentary with a large meal. and while the employee was answering my question, the MGR. on duty called to the employee and discharged him for the day loud enough for myself to hear and just for talking with customers.what kind of good business or customer relations is this when an employee has to be afraid to answer questions asked to him/her? I feel if a customer is in need of answers, he/she should get what is asked without worries of interfering with job duties. and the MGR.tag name as Rubia . I informed the MGR. that i was not happy with her attitude to employees, and walked out without eating. I think someone needs to get there quick to verify the way they treat the work force, because this is not the first time I personally witness how a employee is been treated..
Hope this help to remedy a situation..
 



 Nathan and Cowley Central Texas 1/18/12 
 Hey, How come none of the employees in any of the stores ever where gloves? It is gross to watch the employees scratch their butt, head and other body areas then start handling the food. I see the hand washing sink but, it&apos;s too clean.
Also, Wendy&apos;s hamburgers and chicken sandwiches are bigger, better prepared and taste alot better for the lower prices than y&apos;all. Wendy&apos;s employees also follow the health standards better by washing their hands and then wearing the gloves to handle the food before serving. Y&apos;alls health standards for food handling are not there if there are any. 



 Ex-McDonalds Customer 1/18/12 
 Would have given it zero stars or even a negative 10 stars rating if I could!

McDonalds in Anaheim Calif, Euclid and Katella streets about a mile from Disneyland.

&quot;Reprehensible behavior from &quot;manager&quot;!

I ordered at the drive thru a cheeseburger, large popcorn chicken, 2 snack wraps and 2 cokes. When I pulled up to the window, before the girl handed me the bag, I asked for a &quot;couple of ranch dressings&quot; for the snack wraps. The girl gave me the bag, I looked inside and saw the 2 ranch dressings and the 2 spicy sweet sauce containers....and got the 2 beverages.

The Hispanic manager spoke to her in spanish, she acted suprised. Then she asked for the bag back...and handed it to the manager...a hispanic man. Then the manager was looking in the bag, slightly out of my view. She than handed the bag back and apologised. I left.

When I arrived home, I was suprised, startled..then angry! The Manager had removed the spicy/sweet sauce and left the 2 ranch in the bag.

I find it reprehensible that an employee of your restaurant would be sneaky and lack the very basics of the concept of customer service. As far as I am concerned..he stole things from my bag after I had accepted my order.

Theft. Poor customer service. Lack of integrity. Reprehensible behavior. And this is your Manager???

If he had the spine and backbone (and balls!) to have asked like a professional for an extra fee for extra sauce, I would have forked over a reasonable amount of money for the extra sauce.

He did not! He showed me disrespect and what a slime ball he is. No character, This is the kind of person you have working there? I feel so sorry for the &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; employees McDonalds hires!&quot;



 



 Tonia Demarco 1/16/12 
 I went to one of your store&apos;s and ordered a bacon and ranch salad after paying for it got to the next window. Just find out no ranch dressing I was okay with that however after driving off the notice no crackers,or fork. Plus the lettuce was old and chicken burnt. Two days later at a different store pulled up to the drive thru ordered chicken sandwich, fries,and two apple pies they tell me it will take 1 minute did I want to wait. I said no was in a hurry. I was the only one in the drive thru at the time. I had to wait 4 minutes for my food. After driving off I found my fries just warm and sandwich old. Why wait 4 minutes for that. Plus I didn&apos;t even get to eat food. Had to work hungry. I use to work for McDonald&apos;s and this kind of stuff was not heard of. The food was timed. The employees actually cared. 



 Robert 1/15/12 
 Visited McDonald&apos;s store in Henderson, nevada on Stephanie and sunset, and mgr was doing training review with employees in the restaurant, so I could hear the questions regarding proper temps for foodstuffs. For the most part the employees got a lot of the answers right, but couldn&apos;t figure out some of the answers regarding proper internal food temps. It didn&apos;t make me feel too confident about wanting to visit this store again if the employees can&apos;t remember protocol. 



 Suzan in Phoenix 1/11/12 
 Dear Pissed Off,
I am with you. If I could give zero stars I would. I found a McDonalds equally as bad to yours: 6335 E Greenway, Scottsdale, AZ 85254. It is Store # 17594. They have NEVER gotten my breakfast order right and today I had them refund my money and told them I was Through. The biggest problems is NOBODY on the cook line speaks or reads English! McDonalds is notorious for hiring illegals and those who don&apos;t speak english. I tell them NO CHEESE and Well Done on the Canadian Bacon. Each time I get it, it has cheese. The time before this very last time, my BUN was well done........I am talking burnt beyond recognition. I told this to the guy at the window this morning and he assured me my order would be correct. Well.......it was not. I had CHEESE once again on my sandwich. Burger King, here I come! They actually use fresh eggs and cook them, not nuke them. 



 Cherre&apos; 1/10/12 
 I love eating at McDonalds! Just a suggestion, though--I had a stroke a month ago, and I can no longer eat chocolate or caffeine. Please add unsweetened decaffeinated tea to your beverages. I cannot stand &quot;sprite, orange, punch, rootbeer, etc.&quot; Too sweet. I beg you to understand that decaffeinated is not a choice for some people (everyone seems to think this). Please add this to your beverages. Thank you so much.

 someone needs to send someone from corperate to mcdonalds on mcfarland in tuscaloosa,al.the way they talk to their employess is awlful,i have seen employess leave out of there crying becasuse of what and how they were being treated.ive overheard them talk about working all day without breaks in the heat over the summer.someone needs to get there quick...to see whats really going on. i know from experience that its is a known fact that everthing ive stated is true cause I WORK THERE.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEND SOMEONE 



 edwin santana 1/5/12 
 Wendys is far better then your company, the burgers are made fresh and there nice and juciy, not like McDonald&apos;s burgers that are precooked and put in a plastic tray to.wait for the next person to buy ! And your food is quite expensive ! With not taste and you nuggets aren&apos;t good either!
 



 TYT Member Metalman4wii 1/5/12 
 This is a reply to Gracie
That&apos;s really nothing when I was 12 some 16 years ago. I emptied out my change jar and walked to my Mcdonald&apos;s and I was 5 short of getting my meal and they would rather throw away the food then lose 5 cents. now as any business person would tell you that&apos;s insanity to throw lose out on more money because someone is a few cents short. that&apos;s why I always tell the fast food cashier to keep my pennies for someone who needs it. also that was nice what you did I&apos;m glad there&apos;s still some people who believe in some form of Socialism. but remember this is a Capitalism Society most people don&apos;t care if there&apos;s starving children in fact a few will even laughed those people are called the Far Right Wing aka Teabaggers...! 



 pissed off 1/3/12 
 and the only reason they get 1 starz cuz there&apos;s no 0 sierra vista arizona there are 2 mcdonald&apos;s 1 on fry boulevard and 1 on highway 92 they are the worst mcdonald&apos;s out there ever. the 1 on fry boulevard is worse than 1 on my way to believe it or not they can never seem to get any order rightand I&apos;m not the only 1 with issues the whole town have problems with these mcdonald&apos;s so if you guys ever come to sierra vista arizona do not come to this mcdonald&apos;s I just wish the richardson family the owners of these franchise will wise up fire some people to get these damn places working right 



 rudy cornejo 1/1/12 
 I was charged 25 cents for a pump of more chocolate syrup for my sundae. You call it &quot;Drizzle&quot; which is what I preferred to your &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; syrup. I requested more syrup because the original associate did not give me enough to last through the entire sundae. Just one small drop on top. The manager said it would cost me an extra 35 cents and then she said 25 cents. The receipt was labeled &quot;1 extra sauce packet&quot; with NO tax. Since when do you charge extra with what should have come with the sundae?? Chocolate syrup is chocolate syrup whether it&apos;s hot fudge or your &quot;Drizzle&quot;. Please stop hiring these would-be illegal aliens with their smart-sassy attitude. The manager is a Ms &quot;Parada&quot; at the 1071 Elden St. Herndon. Va location. Please get rid of her and all those illegal aliens who barely understand English. I&apos;m sick and tired of their lousy service! 



 Crystal 12/30/11 
 I would like to start off by saying that I personally love McDonalds.But i think the corporate office needs to send in an under cover employee to McDonalds store #31686 , 116 Fifth Avenue Huntington,wv 25701. Every time we go there they always have a complaint on them.. Me and my husband went there today Dec.30 2011 at 16:11 pm . There was a gentleman standing in line that said he had been waiting on his food for 10 minutes and no one would talk to him. He asked to speak to the manager no one would pay any attention to him at all , the manager finally came over with his food and he tried to tell her about his service. But as usuall she didn&apos;t care , she said you should hav already gotten your food and DID NOT APOLOGIZE AT ALL!!!!!! She turned and walked off , the man said he would never come back again, and I can&apos;t blame him... The service Sucks there, U can&apos;t believe that the owner/corporate office would allow this .. I thought customer service comes above All !!! I am begging please send someone to investigate..

 McDonald&apos;s on Clinton hwy in Powell TN is HORRIBLE! 2 weeks in a row I got sick there

 bobbie 12/31/11 
 I was a customer at the mcminnville tn mcdonalds and i was very disappointed my the way the managers spoke to there crew like they were dogs and would gloat about the way they were speaking to them using vow language telling them that they will lose their jobs . Thats a same they shouldn&apos;t be in that position if thats how they are going to treat their employees Her name was tanya crowe and she was not the only manager that acted like that.
I was going to drop it but when i order the managers stopped and looked at me like I was crazy and watched me ,when my order was ready the manager Tanya almost threw my food at me and gave me a half crocked smile and turned around and made a comment about me now that was the last straw that was totaly uncalled for and on top of that she gave me the wrong food with cold over salted fries why would a manager do that she knew good and well that was not fit for a dog to eat and thats pretty d**** bad. I&apos;m going to file a foraml complaint about how the business is being ran and its pretty sad i file a complaint with the franchise owner and nothing is being done about it The mcDonalds corp. should moniter there franchise&apos;s very close so that they are going by the mcdonald standard. I hope that you will investgate this matter and i hope its in the best interest that you make sure that they don&apos;t hire people like Tanya which i found out by another worker got fired from a corp store and came to tn and got a job with the franchise mcd Please do something about this 



 Randy Birmingham 12/29/11 
 The location downtown Miami next to the collage.
I have been eating breakfast every morning and sometimes lunch. The bathrooms herdly ever hes paper. If I tell them they don&apos;t respond. The service is rude and slow. If I need anything like a token, Napkins, Or a refill, The service is long wait times and rudely given. I think you need to send someone to watch them for a few days and you will see for yourself. I am retired and would like to continue eating there if things would get better. I know in your training, The costmer is always right and the service is done with a smile. None of this is being done at your restront in downtown Miami. I was told that this restront is privatly owned and they can run things the way they want... I realy think your people needs to look into this.

Thanks. Randy. 



 Cierra Johnson 12/29/11 
 I would personally like to say that the Hot&amp;Spicy McChickens are the best. I would go to Lake Village, AR just to get it when I come back for vacation to visit my family. I live in Hot Springs, AR and I think it the Hot&amp;Spicy McChickens would be a big hit if they were at every McDonalds and not just some. 



 Robin 12/23/11 
 I am very impressed with the mcdonald&apos;s at 55 and bayless in saint louis missouri city limits. I have recently visited in store and through the drive thru. I am impressed with how cordial and nice the employees are to the customers. however I was even more impressed with how respectful of the employees were to 1 another. the service is great and the food was high quality. my only complaint is that this is a 24 hour store, and they turned the frappe a ice cream machine on around rush hour 4 cleaning. it seems like an awfully busy time to have a piece of equipment shut down. 



 Robin 12/23/11 
 I have recently been looking at the job opportunities postings 4 mcdonald&apos;s restaurants in my state. 4 most of the postings I was very impressed with the amount of information listed in terms of job titles and benefits. I was extremely shocked when looking at the mcdonald&apos;s restaurants in saint joseph missouri that every single location listed $6.65 as the starting wage 4 crew positions. the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009. how is it legal for any mcdonald&apos;s restaurant to list a lower wage as a starting wage for their crew members????? I think corporate need to investigate this matter. 



 josh bryant 12/23/11 
 hi im here to complain about the MacDonald&apos;s in murphy nc...the service sucks, the managers suck the people suck i call to ask for corporate&apos;s number and was told by manager &quot;RICK&quot; that i was not allowed to have your number what a great guy...i mean come on they mess up on my order then tell me they didn&apos;t then they say i can not have corporate&apos;s number i mean what is the problem here?? i say they need to learn some respect and people skills if they want to work in a public place like that...i think i know what i ordered i cant help it if they hear something wrong maybe he should be listening to his customers more instead of playing with himself maybe you can respond to this an let me know something or how you can fix this problem email is bryant_364@hotmail.com...isnt the customer always right???
 



 Gracie Montes 12/23/11 
 If I could I would give a VERY poor rating for a Mc Donald&apos;s in Los Banos 93635. Two Lil girls about 7 years old (judging by their appearance it was obvious that they were in need) The girls were at the counter handing the manager Cassie a receipt dated 12/06/11 saying that they didnt get their chicken sandwich in their order, the manager looked at the receipt and told them that the receipt was for something different than they were asking for. The little girls continued to demand their chicken sandwich with somewhat of a look of embarrasement as they glanced to the people around. It was evident that they were hungry and were trying to get a sandwich. Cassie firmly stated back to the young girls that the receipt was dated 12/06/11 and thattot wasnt today&apos;s receipt, at that point I intterupted and told Cassie the manager to please give them what they were asking for and please add it to my total she immediately agreed, walked over to my cashier &quot;Andrew&quot; which by the way was in training, she told him to take our order and add the chicken sandwich. We are talking about 99 cents for heavens sake!! FOOD!!!! I guess it&apos;s more important to keep your job than to feed a hungry child! McDonalds throws so much food away daily, i dont think that an unaccounted chicken pattie and a pair of buns would break the golden arches!!! Mcdonalds, ur company policy should enforce moral ethics!!! After all, the kids are the ones who keep the golden arches shining. Dear Lord what is this world coming to?
 



 Jean Meiners 12/26/11 
 I agree with one entrant that one (1) star is not low enough. I live in Salt Lake City, UT (actually West Valley). Normally, we go to only one McDonald&apos;s Restaurant on 5600 South between Bangerter Hwy and 4000 West. We have yet to go in there, no matter how small or how large the orders are, and have one right yet. We check now before we leave the parking lot. On one occasion we found, and the only reason we go there, is my great grandson who is 9 years old and handicapped. He is hooked on your nuggets (actually the first meat he ever ate and thanks to McDonalds, chicken is the only meat he still eats). But they never, ever get anything right!!! I know we are have an up and growing Hispanic population, but when they do not understand what you are saying, or pretend to I found out, it is extremely difficult to converse on any level. I have had orders up to and including $75 for my family, which can be quite large, so badly screwed up, I gave up and spent more money somewhere else, not McDonald&apos;s. Isn&apos;t there anything that can be done? 



 Kerra shelton 12/27/11 
 My husband and I visited McDonalds on 12/24/2011. I had recently purchased the living social deal:Living Social: 5 FREE Big Mac Vouchers and 5 FREE Large fries Vouchers valid at McDonalds for $13....May be used over multiple visits Limit one Big Mac voucher and one Large Fries voucher per store visit per customer Vouchers valid at any participating US location Be sure to mention your LivingSocial voucher before placing your order. When I approached the window I mentioned the &quot;living social&quot; deal and my husband and I mentioned 2 seperate orders. I ordered the free big mac and the free large fry for each order (2) and I was immediately told that I could only use one(1) coupon. I responded to the cashier and explained that that the voucher clearly stated that I could use both coupons in a single visit per person. I was quickly cut off by the cashier who said firlmy &quot;I got it&quot;. when i pulled to the first window, the cashier told me to pay 2.65 oer order. I explained to her that the coupons were for a free big mac and a free large fry and the cashier shut the window and called 2 other employees. A person came to the window and said that the coupons did not entitle us to free big mac or fies. She stated that If I went to the website I would see that the items were 1.50 each. I attempted to explain the &quot;living social&quot; deal and she insisted that I pay 2.65 for each order. I requested my coupons back, went to another restaurant and had no problem with getting deal.

I am extremely disappointed that I was treated rudely and as if I was attempting to take advantage or get something that I was not entitled to. I purchased the vouchers and I should have been able to use them at the Mcdonalds that was most convenient to my home. I had to drive another 10 miles to another McDonalds where the cashier was so nice and was familiar with the living social deal and had no problem.
 



 Julie 12/21/11 
 A &quot;poor&quot; rating for 1 star just isn&apos;t low enough! I went to the location at 305 New Shackle Island Rd., Hendersonville, TN on my way home this evening (12/21/11). I don&apos;t expect 5 star food or service, but I do expect common courtesy and food that doesn&apos;t taste like it was made last week (not to mention a watered down drink). I ordered the Mushroom/Swiss burger combo (made it a large). At the first window, I was told my total - she took my cash, closed the window, crumpled my (and several other) receipts, never said please/thank you/would you like a receipt - NOTHING! AND, she proceeded to turn her back to the window. The young lady who gave me my food at the 2nd window was a bit more cordial. I started to say something, but it appeared there was no one of any authority around. Do you even mandate proper customer service/training? I would love to see what your mystery shoppers say. I could have/and certainly will take my business and money elsewhere. WHAT A TOTAL SHAME! 



 Kathy Long 12/11/11 
 I would just like to write and say: Concerning the: &quot;McDonald&apos;s Store&quot; and &quot;People&quot; at the: &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; at 1636 Us 41 Byp S Griffin GA (770) 228-4344!!!!!
The Manager&apos;s and the people, who work at this store, &quot;ARE TRULY THE BEST EVER&quot;!!!!!! As I come in almost daily, and get &quot;4-6 Large Cappuccino&apos;s&quot;! I could &quot;NOT&quot; ask for, &quot;Better Service&quot;, &quot;Loving/Kind/Caring People&quot;!!!!!! &quot;They are &quot;TRULY The BEST&quot;! When they see me come through the door, they know &quot;EXACTLY&quot; who I am and what I am coming for!!!! &quot;I just love everyone of them&quot;!!!! They always have a &quot;smile&quot; on their face, always &quot;friendly, and always, go out of their way to: &quot;show you that they care!&quot; I have been to every &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, in Griffin GA and Barnesville GA and &quot;WILL NOT&quot; go back to them, as: &quot;THIS McDONALD&apos;s&quot; is &quot;truly&quot; the &quot;BEST&quot;!!!!!! They &quot;ALWAY&apos;s&quot;, go that extra mile to let you know that: &quot;THEY CARE&quot;!!!! I have &quot;NEVER&quot; met a &quot;RUDE/UNCARRING&quot; employee in this restaurant!!!!!! My first job, when I was young was at: &quot;Hardee&apos;s&quot; and I know, &quot;how much&quot; it means to people, for the staff to &quot;SHOW PEOPLE THAT THEY CARE&quot;!!!! And, to &quot;MAKE SURE&quot; that, they get it right!!!! And, &quot;EACH OF THEM &quot;ALWAYS&quot; get it, &quot;RIGHT!&quot; No matter, what kind of day they are having, &quot;NONE&quot; of them show anything but: &quot;KINDNESS with a &quot;SMILE&quot;! I wish each store could/would be this way!!!!! I plan on doing something special for them at this &quot;CHRISTMAS&quot; this year, to &quot;SHOW THEM&quot; that &quot;WHAT THEY DO&quot;, DOES MAKE A DIFFERANCE!!!!!!!!!! &quot;THANK YOU&quot;, &quot;MCDONALDS&quot; For such &quot;WONDERFUL and CARING&quot; People!!!!!! 



 Harland Mayes 12/10/11 
 Store number 16696 must be among your top rated stores in Texas. WELL DONE! Always friendly, quick service and very very clean. I go there often as do many other regulars. There are always groups in there, all buying food.
I especially like the WIFI. Hope I don&apos;t occupy the booth more than is appropriate. I know one men&apos;s group that I became acquainted with while going there in the mornings for coffee and breakfast last year. Well, I&apos;m still looking for a job but have begun social security.
Apparently the employees are treated well because it seems like it is always well staffed which also means to me that things are clean, picked up and stocked.
Macdonalds is not known for high paying but I&apos;m not a believer in minimum wage as dictated by congress. Many in congress have probably never had to meet a payroll or deal with a person to person business so their viewpoint is from ignorance...Many jobs are low skill but not meant to be the last position a person has...but only as starter jobs..understandable!
This store is a winner ....give the people who manage to stick it out faithfully being there on time for two years or more another 20 cents. Just a suggestion!
I am also glad that you require the guys to wear belts and keep their pants up so as NOT to show their underwear. It would be great to for the window sticker on the door which presently requires people coming in to have shoes and shirt to NOT be showing off their hanes...
Another Macdonalds or I should say other stores I&apos;ve seen where some kid had his shirt tail out, and his underwear still showing...there is no excuse for this. I mentioned it to the manager. All she said was &quot;thats the style!&quot;...I refuse to buy food from someone who also wants to show off his underwear as a fashion statement! I also asked the kid why...he says that he doesnt have a belt..what a lame stupid remark!
Well thats all for tonight..again store number 16696 and another Macdonalds east of that location on Hwy 66...both great places!

Sincerely,
Harland Mayes

 hi my name is john. I was in the mcdonald&apos;s on saviers road in oxnard california. my wife invited me to breakfast. she got there before me I met up with her. when she was ordering I decided just to have coffee. well she was doing that a step to the side the check some text messages. when she was done ordering she was asking me if I wanted anything else. during that time, the general managers sergio. came over to her saying you gotta go and take your son too....( I guess he thought I was her son) needless to say, he kicked us out for no reason. he said he called the police and they were on their way. so when I left the store with my wife. I call the police myself. I asked if he called and he did not. but I filed a report anyways. because every time I&apos;m near that restaurant. I get harassed by transients begging for money, both inside and out of the restaurant. we&apos;ve even seen drug deals done inside and outside the restaurant. and this is a daily thing. hey used to do a couple 1000 dollars business a year there... but no more not with sergio there. because he cannot keep drug dealers and transients out of the restaurant...so please do something about it..I did do a phone report when it happened but I haven&apos;t heard back from anyone....thank you john Sudac

 When I heard that they were tearing down the McDonald&apos;s on Main st.in Hendersonville, TN I was shocked!!! ( I heard it had a cracked foundation) they had remodeled it not too many years ago..it was pretty and just right. All they needed was a good cleaning team to keep the play area cleaner.
The new McDonald&apos;s on Indian lake blvd opened up during the middle of the year, I was stunned when I walked in..it was like I walked into a doctor&apos;s office with a McDonald&apos;s..NO SEATING, no good sturdy booths anymore..horrible, ugly decore. Not an inviting atmosphere at all!!!! The new one on Main, St is very disappointing!
I went tonight with my family..not enough seating either. I actually was approached by people asking if we were leaving.

Whoever designed this was out to lunch mentally. I voiced my opinion out loud and 4 people piped up and a big discussion started that it&apos;s obvious that McDonald&apos;s is obviously trying to turn customers&apos; away..you don&apos;t have to say that twice.
The food prices have gone up, too..this is like the Michael Jackson Syndrome..pay out a fortune to get ugly..true stupidity at work..I say..tear down the uglyteeny tiny new McDonald&apos;s and build it back like the old one.theat lured custome.I will not be going back...Funy thing..I wasn&apos;t the only one saying it. Common sense is priceless and a lot cheaper!!!!!

 I&apos;m informing you about my visit at Mcdonalds - 2400 Homer Adams Pky, Alton in Alton, Illinois 62002 of Susan/Dick Bold. I ordered my meal with little problems and sat down to eat.I noticed that i had a Mc.Donalds glass on my tray and stopped one of the workers and asked to why i had this glass and was told that it was complimentary with a large meal. and while the employee was answering my question, the MGR. on duty called to the employee and discharged him for the day loud enough for myself to hear and just for talking with customers.what kind of good business or customer relations is this when an employee has to be afraid to answer questions asked to him/her? I feel if a customer is in need of answers, he/she should get what is asked without worries of interfering with job duties. the name on the employee&apos;s tag was T.J. and the MGR. had no name tag. I informed the MGR. that i was not happy with her attitude to employees, and walked out without eating.

 Dear Mcdonald Corporation,
I am leaving you this comment regarding the time your&apos; establishments stop serving breakfast. Here in Michigan it is 10:30AM on weekdays and 11:00AM on weekends. I believe this is too early for the Church crowd and those who work late shifts at work. Everyone deserves to enjoy a hot Mcdonald&apos;s breakfast. Please contact me with the corporations feelings on this matter. Anne.rossow@yahoo.com
Being a church goer myself, I one day, would like my children to enjoy the breakfast after our sunday service. :)
Thank You.

 I have to tell you about my experience this morning at our local McDonald&apos;s in McMinnville, Tn. My husband and I went through the drive-thu and ordered two breakfast buritto meals which include two buritto, hash brown and a drink. I ask for the drinks to be diet coke, one with no ice and the other with lite ice. The girl in the box ask me which drink I wanted to be lite ice.....I thought she was trying to mess with my head. I said they are both lg. diet cokes to which she replyed &quot;yes, but which one do you want lite ice&quot;. How do these dumb people get to work? I hope she didn&apos;t drive herself.

 After many issues over many years, I am making my very first offical complaint concerning McDonald&apos;s. From 1985 to 1989 i was a Store Manager for McDonalds, therefore I understand fully the issues and difficulities in the daily running of a store. However, I can no longer sit back and continue to keep silent concerning the very poor customer service I have received at my neighborhood McDonald&apos;s. Tonight was just another in a long list of issues we (my family) have encountered. My wife stopped by the McDonald&apos;s on Dobbin Rd on the way home, ordering a double cheeseburger with no pickles nor onions, but add Mayo. When my wife arried home, i opened the sandwich and low and behold, there were pickles! I&apos;m not alegeric to pickles however, they definitely make me nauseous!!! She then went to the McDonald&apos;s close to our house to get two sandwiches and this time, instesd of Mayo, they put on Big Mac sauce. I returned the sandwiches and asked for he Owner&apos;s name to which I was told that information could not be given out. I left a business card and asked the &quot;manager&quot; to have the store manager call me.

Let me be clear, I fully understand that problems will arise, however, every other visit we make there, we have an issue. We (consumers) visit fast food restaurants because of their convenience. When we have to return the product or can&apos;t consume the product, it defeats the purpose of going there!

 



 Amy 11/28/11 
 Everytime just about unless a manager is taking my order&amp;its not a rush the Commerce McDonalds gets my order right. Lunch rush or lazy people taking my SIMPLE DRINK ORDER gets it WRONG every freaking time!!!! How hard is it to understand larger coke with NO ICE!?! I always make NO ICE very plain to them&amp;99.9% off the time they get it wrong! These people need to learn to give their customers what they order the first time! Plus the girls at the 1st window are always texting with their phones&amp;complain about they are cold or its to hot or beeing stupid with another co worker&amp;not doing their jobs!! I dont care how much more i have to pay for a coke i&apos;m taking my business to sonic where the LISTEN&amp;DO THEIR JOBS!!! 



 Pat 11/21/11 
 Had a bad experience ordered a bacon biscuit looked at it before leaving parking lot and took it into the counter the lady ask if she could help I replied I would like some bacon on my biscuit, She said we always put 2 pieces on each biscuit broke in half I said there is only one piece broke in half, she then said do you want extra bacon and she said it would be extra charge but I would only get the same amount. I said no and took a sausage biscuit instead, it is down right redicules you don&apos;t get any bacon on the biscuits. &quot;WHERE IS THE BACON&quot; People should stand up and boycott your chain for stealing from the public. I know you could do better than this. This was at store #11400 Tel#828-665-4860. See what you can do to change this matter surely your chain makes enough money to provide more bacon for a biscuit!!

 I just ordered at the Mcdonalds at Rio Rancho NM. I order 2 happy meals and a meal, I asked for fresh crispy fries. This Mcdonalds is under construction and there is scaffolds all around and on top of the Drive through area. I took pictures of this just in case a board or tool fell on my car. Anyway, I got home and the chicken nuggets were undercooked, fries looked like they were 10 days old and very soggy, my hamburger cheese was so cold it broke into pieces.
I called the manager and spoke with Chris and Mr. Wellow if this is there correct names,Chris first answered and said he was the manager and I told him I couldnot go back to get a $10.50 refund and I am also leaving out of town thankgsgiving is next week, and asked if he could mail me a gift card for that amount.
I recorded the conversation and he told me no; he cannot and then he put me on hold and talked about me to his coworkers and the General Manager Mr. Wellow about me. I asked for someone hire up he sounded like a 12 year old; he said he cant give me the phone number to MR. Wello. I asked well is there someone there to speak with he said no, ok I then asked well who is your boss he said he comes and goes, then I asked ok when can I call him, he said I cant.
Then all of a sudden Mr. Wellow answered the phone and was a even worse manager he said he was a General Manager, I asked him were you the one this Chris guy talked to he said yeah but he is to busy to come to phone. I told him about the slop of food I recieved he said well come get your refund and bring all the food back. First of all; I through it in my big trash can out side and I was not going to dig for it, second of all I asked for a gift card to be mailed to me because I shouldnt have to drive all the way back for there mistake.
I took pictures of the food and recorded our conversation. MCDONALDS PLEASE SEND ME A GIFT CARD FOR THE FOOD I PURCHASED AND DIDNOT EAT. This is all I ask. You serve food this is your business and specialty, this was the worst meal I have ever tested and seen in my life. Contact me essilva_777@hotmail.com. I am aware this store is independently owned , can you at least forward this to the owner.

 As an employee for mcdonalds I would like to make a suggestion to help make drive thru a little easier for people with dissabilities for example people that are deaf. The other night I was working drive thru window taking orders and this woman came thru that is deaf and I had to communicate with her via writing on paper she wrote her order and what not and I put it in, but i think it would be easier if the company should develop a touch screen monitor just like our registers that they can place their order and can come through to the cashiers screen n then pay for it at the window just a thought.

 Me and my husband went to the mcdonalds in las vegas, the one on mrylnd pkwy and katie and i had panda express and my husband was purchasing a meal at mcds. I don&apos;t see any signs saying not to eat any other food in their establishment we were purchasing food from them and a guy that worked there said i could not eat my food which was panda express in their establishment with my husband who was eating their food. I didn&apos;t see what the problem was we were on the bus and decised to eat different variety there is no signs anywhere and it wasn&apos;t like i just walked in with other food to just sit down..I&apos;m a very loyal customer very loyal i go almost two to three times a week faithfully..i felt very uncomfortable and disrespected.

 Manuel 11/11/11 
 My family and i Went to mcdonalds on 11/11/11 on 6221 riverside place Albuquerque nm 87120 and was treated very poorly when my wife found a hair in her food then took it up to inform them. They told her that it was her own hair and the employee got the hair out of her sandwich with his bare hands then proceeded to tell her to finish her food. They refused to give her a replacement sandwich so we left very unhappy with this location and because of this location I nor my family will ever walk in or do any further business with mcdonalds again. And the one star is only there because I couldn&apos;t give them a lower rating. 



 Unhappy and disgruntled customer named Paul 11/11/11 
 The following describes my most recent experiences at McDonalds at Caraway Rd. and Highland Dr. In Jonesboro, AR; It has the most incompetent, lazy, unprofessional, smart eleck, rude, and pathetic excuse for staff and managers ever. I have had a plethera of horrible experiences there!!! This restaurants Employees need to go back to school. The worst coffee and coffee drinks I have ever had and Everytime I have been the past month! I will not be back. The manager refused to give me a refund on my coffee. That is the last and final time they will mess my order up; because of the terrible service to a loyal customer I will not be back!!! What a bunch of clowns!!! According to their security officer they have a lot of complaints all the time. Starbucks will be my new destination from now on. 



 Mayra juandiquez 11/11/11 
 We went to get an order at the mcdonalds on richey, pasadena texas and when we got home my husband bit into his mcrib and a nasty long hair came out, he took it out of his mouth, that was so nasty. when we went back they didn&apos;t apologize just said &quot;oh that&apos;s nasty&quot; so unprofessional. I wanna file and will file a complaint against this nasty and unprofessional mcdonalds. So pissed off and disgusted

 While traveling back to Illinois, my husband and I ate a quick breakfast at the Corydon, Indiana McDonald&apos;s, and we were into Illinois when I noticed that I had left my purse back at the McDonald&apos;s. My husband had the receipt in his pocket and I was able to call the restaurant and was relieved to hear that they had my purse and were willing to mail it to me as I requested. I asked the manager, April cherry, to take the money for the postage out of my wallet and to also give the employee who turned it in an additional amount from my wallet. I received my purse through ups yesterday with everything in tact minus the shipping charges and I must tell you how thankful I am for your honest employees who deserve to be recognized within your corp. The reward money was not even taken out, since April later told me that they didn&apos;t need that. You have some real gems in that restaurant staff. I am very impressed and grateful. 



 Paige 11/7/11 
 my post is not so much for poor service, but towards a health issue. ive been a costumer and Mcdonalds for a very long time but tonight has totally changed my mind if i would ever go there again. my boyfriend came to my house with a bag of food and was enjoying his meal like always. beggining his second bite out of his mcdouble, a DEAD FLY falls off his burger. A LEGIT DEAD fly! this is the most disgusting thing ever. we were so grossed out we went back to the mcdonalds we bought our meal from and the manager there was very nice about it and refunded my money with no problem. but thats not the issue here. a fly is one thing but what if it was something bigger than that? thats not by any means anything someone wants to find in there meal. i think all mcdonalds needs to be a bit cleaner before someone gets sick.


 



 Greg Alamrode 11/8/11 
 My name is Greg Almarode

I live in Lake Forest Ca and I have been going to the Macdonalds on 23861 Bridger Road Lake Forest, CA 92630 for a while, I went about 3 weeks ago and had a 32.00 breakfast order and about half was correct, the other half was either not there or totally wrong. IWent back in that monday and left a message for the manager to return my call...(the day I ordered I was traveling out of town) and got no responce. I went in that Thursday and left another message with the cashier and he said the owner will call me back the next business day. I waited another 3 days and no call, I went in again that Sunday and talked to the same cashier and he said he handed my contact info to her. I understand mistakes were made and I couldnt go back on the same date to correct it but it is unacceptable for the owner of the Macdonalds not to call back and make their error correct. I write to you so your aware of the customer service that is lacking and I just want my mistake corrected.my # is 714-453-8996 I,can be reached anytime if someone cares to respond to this it would be much appreciated.

Sincerely
Greg Almarode

 Robert 11/8/11 
 On 11/5/11 @ 15:30 my wife and I went to the McD&apos;s in Dade City, Fl. The store # is 5018.. As this is a store that has been completely rebuilt from the ground up you would think it should be clean, friendly, and above all the food to be good...WRONG...we live in a town close by Zephyrhills, and had frequented this store when it was the old one.....Always Clean, Food always hot and fresh, and above all the friendliest people working....Since the store has been redone....not the same senario. The tables were dirty the floors food all over the food past its date stamp on the pies....and the ladies room....much to be desired....When my wife took the pie back up to the counter because the time on it was 2+ hours past and it was cold....the girl gave her attitude...I really believe that the people who are now employed there came from the bottom of the barrel. What a Shame..... 



 Tracey 11/1/11 
 I don&apos;t know how they interview or what type of morons they hire, but I&apos;ve had 2 really bad experiences at different mcdonalds in Johnstown PA. The first was at the Westwood plaza location. It took over 20 minutes to get our order. The sad part is there was only 3 customers ahead of us. while we waited, an employee walked past the fries and stirred it, only to reach in with his bare hands and grab some for hisself. He walked on eating them. When they filled our order, my husband told them we weren&apos;t taking the fries we want fresh. The manager asked why and he told him. He acted surprised but never asked who did it. The other was the galleria dr restaurant. I ordered and paid for a double quarter ponder meal and only received a quarter pounder. I called the manager when I got home and asked him if all mcdonalds hired from the idiot academy. Told him what happened and he offered to replace it but i&apos;ld have to go back there. I told him I lived 20 minutes from there so he said he&apos;ld mail out a coupon. That was 2 weeks ago, nothing yet. They just lost 2 customers. We ate there at least twice a week. Sorry mcdonalds. 



 Ricki Mora 11/1/11 
 Recently I sent a complaint to the McDonald&apos;s on south university in Lubbock, Texas. I told them how they forgot items and how game pieces were torn off of the containers before I was given my order. I went in that same night to ask for the missing parts of my order when I saw the condition of the store I was disgusted. I left threw the food away and never went back. I emailed the store directly but was never responded to. I see customer service is no longer a priority for the McDonald&apos;s corporation. Not only has the quality of your food went down, but the quality of management has went to hell as well. No one cares for your customers anymore. I guess a change in fast food dining is in order. 



 james 11/1/11 
 What is going on with Mc Donalds? Your stores are no longer required to supply simliar quality. I just went into ask mamgement why my cheese was the last thing on my burger, meaning it was still cold. They told me they don&apos;t melt cheese on burgers therefore there is no reason to make it with the cheese touching the burger. What the hell? To top that off I went in to use my monopoly game piece for a French fry and they said it looked torn and could not accept it. .

And is there really a limit of one dipping sauce.

There used to be a day when the service was good at all mc donalds now its not even required to smile at the register. Sour unpleasant faces seem to be the norm these days. Sad times we live in when corporate office cares only about franchise fees and nothing about the way the customer is treated. 



 Amanda 11/2/11 
 Tonight the owners of the McDonalds in Belen, NM came into the fine dining establishment that I work at. I noticed that the woman had an open water bottle sitting on the table. As it is completely illegal to bring an open container of anything into a bar I politely took a glass of water over to the woman&amp;politely said to her that it is illegal in the state of New Mexico to bring an open container of anything into any dining/bar establishment. Her response was &quot;it&apos;s only water and you just insulted me by asking me that.....as she was saying this, her husband proceeded to take the bottle of water and pour it all over my arm. I immediately informed them that I had a right to refuse service&amp;asked them to leave. I hit the McDonalds drive through almost every morning before class but just want you to know a simple incident like this will keep me away from now on. I do not want to give money to an establishment where the owners behave in this manner. BTW, they are lucky I did not press assault charges and if it happens again I will. Thank you,
A up until now a happy customer but not anymore. 

 

 Amanda 11/2/11 
 I do hope you take the time to read my previous statement about the owners of the McDonalds in Belen, NM. Not only because the owners showing total disrespect, I do want to stress I have never had a problem with any of the employees but just to reiterate, I will have no holding back spreading the word of the horrid&amp;illegal behavior of these owners. If they are willing to treat a complete stranger in this manner, I can&apos;t Imagine how they treat their employees. Do they throw drinks on them as well? Might want to take this seriously because even though it was just pouring a bottle of water all over the server&apos;s arm because &quot;they were having a bad day,&quot; again I repeat that is by law considered assault&amp;if it happens again, not only will I refuse your &quot;we had a bad day&quot; McDonalds owners service which I legally have the right to do, I will press charges. 



 Travis Boitnott 10/30/11 
 I came thru the drive-thru at the downtown sharon Pa location on oct 30 at 630 pm ordered 2 large bigmac meals, 2 mcchickens one plain with ketchup and the other one normal !! I get home there&apos;s only one mcchicken in the bag and this isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve had problems with this McDonald&apos;s !! Also the sign out front says free coke glass with every large extra value meal also didn&apos;t receive those !! So I decide to call the store, called the store 4 times between 6:48 and 6:55 no answer!! And while I&apos;m at it I got home and my iced tea had absolutely no ice in it, it was warm!! It&apos;s time something changes at this store I understand mistakes happen from time to time but every time I come to this McDonald&apos;s there is something wrong with my order!! I&apos;m tired of spending my hard earned money and not getting what I paid for!! 



 Joseph Licavoli 10/30/11 
 Your drive thru at this restaurant is terrible for the simple reason is that no one can seem to get an order ready in 20 minutes or less. I came to this location 7100 w cermak rd Berwyn Il I will never come to it again no one can speak english. 



 Ms. Jwaie Shakir 10/29/11 
 Today (October 29, 2011)I visited my favorite Mcdonalds in Wakefield, North Carolina to enjoy my usual salad with my lady friends, only to be told that the manager, Terrence was being transferred to other Mcdonalds. I have lived in Wakefield for six years, and have gone to that Mcdonald&apos;s for three years only because of Terrence and the professional way he does his job and interact with his customers. I have followed him to Wake Forest, NC but I will no longer be a loyal customer if he is moved from Wakefield. I will tell my family, my co-workers (who also thinks highly of Terrence) and friends not to support that Mcdonalds. Before he worked there the service was &quot;cold&quot;. Terrence has indeed made a difference in the way I feel about &quot;fast food&quot; restaurants.

 This morning Oct 30,2011. I went to Beijing, China. hui long guan area for breakfast. After I order 3 breakfast meals with 2 hash brown and I requested a ketchup and cashier only give me &quot;ONE&quot; with 3 meals order. I request additional ketchup and the manager told me one hash brown one ketchup policy by McDonald. Is this how McDonald work ? The manager name is Ms.Cao. Please get back to me on how McDonald is going to handle this matter or issue. I don&apos;t think this is how McDonald spirit, I though McDonald policy is customer are always No.1 policy ? Maybe not anymore ? Every time I request a ketchup or napkin they always give me dirty look in the eyes or say I already give you ONE. So I shouldn&apos;t request additional ONE. It is against your policy ? I lived in the states in the past 30 years and had NEVER run into this kind of confrontation with any fast food chain. 



 Brian Sebastian 10/28/11 
 Today we visited your McDonalds store #3064 in Cincinnati and were not pleased. First they were out of McRib sandwiches when they keep advertising them like crazy. Secondly they were out of ketchup&amp;finally when I wanted to get Barbeque sauce for my fries we were charged!!! That is outrageous!! We will be sure to go to Wendy&apos;s from now on it&apos;s righ down the street anyway. 



 Cheryl Humphreys 10/28/11 
 I would like to see Mcdonalds have a gluteon free menu. Recently our Mcdonalds closed for a few months to remodel. My grandson who is 9 yrs old an has Autism and gluteon free he watched for it to open for weeks. We had to tell him he cant eat there because they have no glut. free food hes so disappointed. You would think a restraunt thats points out kids to make their PR better they would have one. Really wished you all would. Thanks 



 NPALMER 10/27/11 
 My issue has nothing to do with food - Your store in Salinas, CA on South Main Street has my mothers phone number listed on both Yahoo and PacBell listings, if that didn&apos;t generate enough wrong calls to my mother having it listed on every receipt that your customers receive at the Salinas, So. Main Street location certainly does. She has had the same phone number for over 60 years and at 88 years of age answering the phone at 2:00 in the morning is ridiculous to say the least. She also receives these calls during the day at least twice a week.
Several months ago I contacted the Salinas location and spoke with the store manager and my mother is still getting the calls. She deserves a good nights sleep so please get this changed. I am not listing her phone number just check Yahoo or call you Salinas, CA South Main location and get the number. If you need to contact me my email is ltwnancy@pacbell.net

 On October 21 2011 I visited the McDonalds at the Fountain Place Mall in Logan WV. There were 3 of us in my party. There were only 3 people in line and it took forever to get waited on. The shift manager was working the register. He was in no hurry to get peoples orders out. The floor was nasty, the place was not clean. Service was horrable. We ordered 3 fish sandwiches,3 fries,1 10 piece nugget and 3 drinks. When we finally received the order I had to go back to the counter because the order was incomplete or wrong. I had to do this 3 times in order for it to be right. The Fries were cold, the nuggets were hard. There did not seem to be any urgency to take care of customers. After we ate we went shopping and I began to get sick. I had to leave and go home. On my way home I began to throw up. I had been food poisioned from McDonalds. This is the second time I have gotten sick from McDonalds. I went to the web site and complained. I received a phone call from the manager Chris Connolly. I explained about my visit, he really did not seem to upset about the problem. He said he would send me some coupons. Well I got it today. It was for 1 free small coffee. I do not drink coffee! I am insulted by this guester. I would like for someone from the head office to contact me. 606-237- 4743

 On October 23rd I emailed the manager of the Alexandria, Ky store. For the past year everytime you get coffee on the weekends it is terrible! I still have not received feedback from the manager, which i feel is very unprofessional. I was a loyal customer, but due to lack of concern by management I will no longer return. I will gladly pay a lot more for Starbucks. Better service and it always taste good.

 I never in my life have ever had to deal with a bad Mcdonalds until i moved in the warren mi area and visited the 9 mile Van Dyke store. They have employees that are immature and would rather stand around and talk than work they have managers that act like they just came out of grade school that have no business being managers they don&apos;t do their job either when there is a complaint brought on to them they look their eyes up i air like &quot;oh brother i got to deal with this to now&quot; I was i there with my family eating one time and i went to the front counter to wait for a beverage and a man game in from drive thru because he had been parked for over a half hour waiting on a couple drinks and made a comment that he had just got out of prison and he was afraid to go back if they didn&apos;t hurry their butts up that it was ridiculous he had to wait all that time and i was so freaked by what he had said and the store manager didn&apos;t care then either she looked up in the air and still proceeded to take care of other customers like she was blowing him off i have seen and heard also that they have cockroaches really bad customers complain about rats being by the doors they always have to keep the bathroom doors locked because customers dirty them and they don&apos;t wanna clean them up their employees are rude they don&apos;t care how they speak to one another when customers are around regardless rude sexual or whatever and telling corporate don&apos;t do anything hello health department maybe if they got turned in they would step up and really do something

 RUDE, ROACH INFESTED, NOISEY BOSSY!!! This mcdonalds is located on 47TH&amp;CICERO, cicero Il.I thought this mcdonaldS would be a good rated restaurant with it being so close to midway airport_ I guess not as soon as I walked in 1 foot through the door I got a &quot;can I help you! Cashiers sounded like robots! Perfection can only go so far! I was ready to order I believe the cashier understood that but the managers were pressuring the employees to constantly ask if I was ready!&amp;shouting for them to get all orders under 30 seconds, from the way it looked instead of bossing them around the next step should of been helping out. I sat right arcoss from the registers, but the employees were very very loud&amp;rude with swearing&amp;yelling! To the point I moved myself&amp;2 kids to another table father away from the noise. My daughter point out there is a bug on the wall. I look and ITS 2 ROACHE
S!!! In the lobby I could imagine was behind the counters! Beyond disgusted!!!! As much as it tastes good I won&apos;t waste money on it how I would of before. I&apos;ve called corporate a number of times nd nothings been done!!!!!! 



 Aimee Quigley 10/20/11 
 Your Mio Michigan mcdonalds is so poorly ran I rather drive a half hour to get decent food and service. I think its about time you get someone to fix this problem. You have 5 damn managers on staff at once and not one of them knows what they are doing. This happens everytime in this place. They are all non reading high school drop out idiots. They don&apos;t get your order right because they can&apos;t read it.

 I understand that people on this site are unhappy or have been treated in an undeserving manner. However, this internet worldsickens me. I&apos;m sure all or most of you can handle all of these issues by contacting the higher UPS in each of these stores. Go to the very top. I just think that if you really want to have your problem resolved it will do you absolutely no good to complain here. A lot of you sound like you have legit issues but there is nothing anyone reading these can do. Mc donalds isn&apos;t going under no matter what&apos;s been done to you , no matter how bad you&apos;ve been treated or what horrible food you&apos;ve been given. if the reason your writing is to get your issue resolved....you NEED to go to someone at the top. That&apos;s all I have to say. So sick of people always complaining when theres absolutely nothing anyone of US can do. That&apos;s it.

 I&apos;d like to to share an idea. I own a grooming/boarding business and know that millions of pet owners travel with their pets. Why doesn&apos;t McDonalds have a McDoggy meal? It would consist of a so glen serving packet of kibble, a water, and a treat...it could even offer toys like a tennis ball or squeeky toy. This would help owners on the go cater to their pets. Hope you consider it. 



 Conrad Baron 10/15/11 
 We had entered your establishment on 10/15/11, to treat our granddaughter to a happy meal. Now we had been to your McDonalds for many your years and never had any complaints with the cleanliness previous. It was when we took her into the indoor playroom that the problem started. The whole area was filthy. The tables hadn&apos;t even been cleaned, as well as all the high chairs. My wife had to clean off the seat as well as the table before even attempting to sit down. The tray had to be taken out to the service area just to have someone clean it. Their were kids running around with bare feet, and the bumpers on the playset were filthy. You could visible see the filth on all the bumpers. When we went to leave and go to the bathrooms, there was water in both bathrooms and in front of both doors to the bathroom. The bathrooms had backup, and water was everywhere. Posing a slipping hazard for all.
I was throughly digusted with the experience. I had been a previous employee at a different establishment, but it seems that pride in your has difinately slide back and should be looked into in the near future.
It will be quite some time till I will enter this establishment again. In these times of so many other restraunts do you really want to estblish a place of filthy building condition, and habits?

 The employees at the Paradise Valley Road San Diego, CA location could use a lot more training. I confused the girl when I asked for a hot tea with a large cup. They were so focused on getting the large cup right that they forgot the rest of my order. I waited for 2 minutes, blowing my horn, in the drive-thru for someone to return to the window. And not to mention the attitudes. I know I get there very early in the morning but if you can&apos;t handle getting up that early, get a night job.

 to the corporation of mcdonlds making a report about 25700 detroit,columbia in cleveland,ohio

thier was a problem with a manager named monica
she yank me by my arm , she also has been harressing me
i&apos;m scared for my life i had to call the police, for the last few days
she been letting employees control her thuoght of mine causing trouble,
not being her self,she don&apos;t think.
restaraunt need to be clean a little bit more, garbage need to be tooken out at night when it supose to not in the morning making bugs a lot of peaple come to eat
eye vision is important for saftey reasons, neeed clean containers to much bacteria, need to have clips for containers one day clips and hour clips they need to order things when they surposed to. i believe i need to be a manager at mcdonlds to get these problems tooking care of. there no rotation in these positions like it shouln be they always have me on the grill i know all the positions.
stephenie has a problem witf nice customers she need to be nicer.
their is elderly people that come every day.
Dowsey is a big problem starting a lot of negetivity not mining her own bisness
she need to focus on her own self she need to learn that responsibility first.
if she don&apos;t police report will be in action.
dowsey, monica,stephenie make mcdonlds look bad with negetivity problems.
 



 Countrylady1913 10/11/11 
 Went to mc Donalds in powell, when I got to the table food was cold fries warm and hard, drink cold and wet just like it was supposed to be.what I did not appreciate was a manager preparing food with no hairncovernand nomgloves on her hand to prevent crossncontamination of food I had to ask squaws for my fries afternthey hadnturned their backs to the counter..I can give you the name of one of the managers that I saw handling food both chicken and beef with out protection.if I get sick I sure will know where it came from.. Somebody needs to donan undercover boss to actually see how some are cavorts and others are yelled at until theynarenatbthenbreakingnpoint. Power is angood area just need tomgetnthenblackmwidiws out and bring in someone more like nanny McPhee.. I hope you will take this to heart and find the true problems, to many roll overs and police change at the drop of a hat,. 



 Misty 10/11/11 
 I have been to McDonalds on Breiel Blvd in Middletown Ohio everyday since the monopoly has started and only ordered things with pieces on them and have yet to recieve one monopoly piece.. They gave me three ice coffees in one visit that were just cream, they are never wearing gloves in the back, never ge an order right the first time it takes ten minutes in the dive thru an twice as long inside. Complaints fall on deaf ears. Customer service does not exist there!!! I will not return there and if I get service like that at the next I won&apos;t go to any!!! And I want my monopoly pieces!!!! 



 Jennifer Cain 10/10/11 
 The McDonalds in Lake St. Louis, MO tops the pathetic list. IF you even get what you ordered IF they even half the items on the menu after waiting 30 minutes the food is inedible. Talking to the garbage can outside gets more results than talking to the management. This is on a regular basis, not just on occasion. 



 Heather Harper 10/10/11 
 My husband took my daughter through the drive-thru at the McDonalds on Grand Island Blvd. in Grand Island NY on Saturday 10/8/11. My daughter ordered a Big Mac meal and when she got home with it, it had NO burgers in it. How can that happen? The thing that has irritated me the most, is that I have called the store numerous times over the past 2 days to complain, and no one EVER answers the phone. It just rings and rings. I have called at least 10-12 times. This is mind boggling to me! Horrible customer service! We won&apos;t be going to McDonalds again. We are done! 



 CC,Texas 10/10/11 
 I visited your S. Port location in Corpus Christi,Texas and used your drive-thru window to place my order. It was around 10:30 pm and when waited on, the waitress was very rude and ugly on the speaker. She had no customer skills. Once at the window to receive my order, I was given the amount, which I had figured to be so much. When she told me how much I owed, I was not satisfied with the amount,so I then asked her for my receipt, which she seemed surprised that I asked for it. I slowly drove off and reveiwed my receipt. She had literally charged me for two extra drinks which I had not ordered. I then went back around and decided to park due to the line of cars waiting to be served. Once inside she asked me what it was I needed. I explained to her that she had overcharged me with two drinks that I had not ordered nor had I recieved. She then returned the extra change I had coming. As I exited the door, she stated, &quot;I hate this fucking shit&quot;. I refused to turn back to tell her how ugly she sounded and how rude she was. Just wanted to make your corporation aware that this waitress is probably doing this to every drive thru customer coming to her window. What a rip-off. She ought to be looked into. She is stealing!!!!!

 LJevans 10/6/11 
 There was once a time when I enjoyed the occasional visit to my local mickey d&apos;s however within the past decade I have consistently experienced poor customer service and I&apos;ve had it! realize the importance of taking of care the most imperative ingredient to a successful business CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I have never been an avid mcdonalds fan nor fast food or quick service for that matter. I am thoroughly upset about this growing trend of poor customer service and refuse to return to any mcdonalds establishments corporate owned or franchised. 



 Joe Hall 10/3/11 
 Your store in Dickson Tn.has the worst service Ive ever seen. We went two nights in a row and had to wait twenty minutes, got a free small coke for waiting.We went again tonight and there was not enough people to service everyone in a timely manner, there was only one register open and no one at that on. we left and went next door to A W and when we came out the person in front of us in the drive throuh was waitin on the side of building. WE got our meal from AW and was on way home in no less than 2 or 3 minutes.

Dear Don Thompson

Recently I attended one of your restaurants in South Bend IN. I had just finished running in one of my college Cross Country meets and I was very tired and hungry. As I pulled up to the drive through, the person who took my order was VERY rude and seemed to not care or even listen in the slightest. When I pulled up to the second window to get my food after I had paid they told me that the food would take a while and that I should pull over to the side and that they would bring my food out to me. I waited there for 10 minutes and when they brought the food out to me it was Luke warm!! As I drove off I bit into the Big Mac I ordered and I noticed a very bad taste! All the vegetables on the sandwich were absolutely disgusting and very old!

I would like a refund on the meal and a sincere apology. I would also like to receive a buffer of exactly $200 dollars for this inconvenience you have caused me. If you do not respond by December 3, 2011 I will be requesting the presence of a third party which will consist of my lawyer and possibly even a Health Inspector.

Thank you for addressing my complaint. I hope to hear from you soon. You can contact me at 574-555-1274 or BradleyH@aol.com

Thank you,

Hector Brady

 My fiance and I were eating lunch at our local McDonalds in Georgia, and when I went to sip some of my tea there was a roach floating on top of it....When brought up to one of the managers she just gave us another cup. Im sorry but after encountering that Im not thirsty anymore. Granted I&apos;m sure all restaurants have some issues but geez, can we get a little bit of pest control. This should not have happened. The tea should not have come out onto the customer floor area. 



 Miguel Leal Jr 9/25/11 
 I just saw a sign stating no loitering 30 min time limit at the restaurant. A time limit on how much time you have to eat that is so so stupid and don&apos;t worry my family and I will dine elsewhere where we will not have a time limit.....

 Antoinette 9/23/11 
 On 9/22/11 I visited the Mcdonalds at 9160 Allen Rd. Westchester Oh. 45069...this was actually my first time back in a long time because of a bad experience in the past... Silly me to have a little faith in thinking this time would be better. I had just gotten off of work and was hungry...I requested a specially made burger and small fry. As soon as I pulled up to the window I was told it will be a minute and a half on fries..ok no big deal since it is almost 10pm and not busy.. So then this character of a person asks if I want something else..I&apos;m guessing so I wouldn&apos;t have to wait? I politely said that is ok...I finally get my food...pull off..checked my bag..no napkins by the way. I open this greasy wrapper and found my sandwich was completely wrong. So this caused me to back up...park..get out and walk in..I tell him my order was wrong and what should have been on it. This joker starts to mock me by repeatedly saying what should be on the sandwich so I said give me my money back and told him how the service is always horrible and that there is always attitude given when they make mistakes...then there is more sarcasm given to me because of the amount of money spent was apparently not enough for him to even care...whats up with filling out all this personal information just to receive a few dollars back?? That&apos;s ridiculous...and unfortunately it made me more hot because he refused to give me my money until it was filled out...This guy had no respect at all so I had non for him... I deserved atleast an apology for my inconvenience but got nothing......good thing I have an substantial admount of friends on facebook that lives and works around the area so I was able to reach out to them and say don&apos;t eat at that mcdonalds and the sad thing about that posting..i received a lot of likes (of what I posted) and comments of the horrible service and food quality...It is true about the old saying..never judge a book by it&apos;s cover..just because this restaurant is located in a higher class community doesn&apos;t mean it has class.....
Thank you for letting me share.

 They are suppose to be known for there &quot;BEST GOURMET COFFEE&quot; its more like &quot;HAIR GOURMET COFFEE&quot;. This morning I went through the drive thur asked for a medium coffee. next thing I know I take a sip to see if it had enough sugar. i pulled out a hair out of my mouth...(YUKKKK)I was so disgusted, I called the manager he had not much to say he was shocked, I asked for the Corp. # and called. I told them what happend and this is the second time this ancident has accured...this time im taking action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 



 Elizabeth Stantz 9/22/11 
 Today about 3PM U was in one of your restaurants it is in The Walmart On Maysville Rd Fort Wayne Indiana. I have never seen such a dirty restaurant and the service was not even there. Number one they were not even busy but, instead of the associates cleaning the tables and cleaning up around the ketchup and pop machines they are behind the counter doing nothing. The floor looks like it hasn&apos;t been mopped in a while. You know I work for WalMart and I will be contacting them about this because this reflects are reputation as well. The classic Chicken sandwich was over cooked and the salad was not fresh and when my husband was eating it a little nat flew out. At that time we were finished. On our way out My Husband also stated he had had it and told her there Store was the most unclean Mcdonalds he has ever ate at. She just looked at him Like he was crazy. You couldn&apos;t even put your arms on the tables because they were sticky. Pop runs on the front of the pop counters,Really I don&apos;t think that is the reputation you want to portray. Thanks very much. 



 Jael 9/22/11 
 I am an employee of McDonald&apos;s and seeing the stuff that goes on &quot;behind the counter&quot; could get them sued big time. I recall one time being at work and the power went out and when it came back on you would naturally think to throw out the cold food that had been sitting out for over an hour and just start making new food, but the GM insisted that if the customer didn&apos;t complain don&apos;t worry about it. Can you imagine how many McDonald&apos;s do this nasty stuff. And there have been flies found in the sauces, vegetables, and ice cream machine and they are still used. Being an employee there has made me stop eating there altogether because it is just gross I don&apos;t even let my daughter touch the food. I could go on and on about other things that go on with the nastiest that goes on at McDonald&apos;s but I&apos;m sure that they still want customers..... 



 Carrie Bowman 9/22/11 
 What a bunch of morons you must be. A restaurant here in Houston is called &quot;&apos;Jus Mac&quot;, serves only macaroni and cheese dishes and someone in corporate thinks they are infringing on your name. Why is it that you would pick on a company who serves food people would really like to sit down and enjoy a meal at. Never once would I confuse macaroni with the preservative pumped hamburgers you serve. Grow up and lay off people trying to make a living. Don&apos;t you folks ever use common sense? 

 

 Deborah Lynch 8/9/11 
 I fell from slipping in a huge puddle of water at the Ephrata Pa Mcdonalds, June 21, 2011. I have been trying to get my hospital bills paid, but the claims adjuster, Linda will not get back to me. this is crazy. I fell, I did not try to fall, I did not try to hurt myself, I just want my hospital bills paid. 



 Ant from Lake City Fl. 8/10/11 
 I&apos;m an employee of McDonalds on Baya. I&apos;ve worked there for almost a year.The employee&apos;s is treated unfairly. Every week I got to call on Tues. to see if I&apos;m working on Wed. because the schedule isn&apos;t up. I get sick and tired of doing that week in and week out. The store manager Jim is a joke he works 3 to 4 days a week and tells his bosses that he work 7 days a week. I can count on my 2 hands how many times I&apos;ve seen him. Most of the managers there are unfair also . You can go there almost anytime and see the managers screaming at the employees in public. Most customers don&apos;t care if you are having a bad day they just want their food. Mcdonalds Corp.needs to investigate in this store. The store manager gives one shift manager special gifts. Like vacations that she don&apos;t have but got an extra check for the week. Filling out paperwork for govt. assistance .Misleading them on hours. I think you call that FRAUD!!! That I have to pay as a tax payer. McDonald Corp. do your job and follow through with your operations and supps manager because they are not doing their jobs. It is their fault as well as vice president of the company. Visit the stores on weekend and nights not just the day. 



 Pissed Off Customer 9/21/11 
 I just sent an email to the manager at 142 S George St, York, PA. I would just like to reiterate McDonald&apos;s has by far the poorest quality service of any fast food restaurant I patronize therefore you will not get another red cent of my hard earned money. Get your act together or just get out of the fast food business all together. Its ridiculous, and based on the overwhelming majority of comments its ridiculous everywhere. 



 Susan Warnock 8/11/11 
 My son and I went to the McDonalds at the Riverchase Galleria in Birmingham, AL on Sunday afternoon. It was tax free weekend and the mall was busy. The McDonalds was over staffed and ready as far as the number of people but it was chaos. Employees were yelling out numbers for food orders, the people working were rude. After 30 minutes and the crowd had thinned we still did not have our food. I asked about my food and one of the young ladies told me I had to wait that other people had to get their food too. And this was after 30 minutes of me waiting. At that time, I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager didn&apos;t speak English. Give me a break. I looked at her and said I wanted to speak with her, she left and went to the back and never ca,e back out. That is the worse service I have ever had and rude kids they all need to be cleaned out and restaffed from the manager down.

 okay this is very irritating. so i got a letter addressing my last visit and in doing so i had figured the problem was addressed and fixed so i went to McDonald&apos;s and in doing so i placed my order and waited on receiving my food. i checked the food if i didn&apos;t i would have made it home with food missing (my two most expensive items) so i pulled up and went in as i went in there where 4 people standing around including a manager no one seemed to interested to help even the manager they all just stood there. the lobby only had a few people in it. I even paid for my food didn&apos;t use the coupons received. Ive worked in the food industry for 8 + years never had anything like this.... this is just getting to be a joke 



 Not saying 8/12/11 
 I would just like to say that I am an employer and I dont get treated that well. I get yelled at if I make a small mistake and I get talked about behind my back... In Spanish so I dont know what they are saying. I work the grill and deep fryer by myself a lot of the time while its going through a rush. I haven&apos;t tried anything new and I have been working there for two months. Its all the same. do not work here. Managers play favorites and show it. Its rude and no one cares. I hate working here.

 This in regards to your mcdonalds in ft dodge iowa on 107 ave. The custmer care is very very poor. _he food is always cold and has a nasty taste to it. And my daughter is highly allergic to wheat and there needs to be a menu for kids with ceilic. I tried to explain it and I had an arguement with one of the worker at that location. I have no issues at the other mcdonalds with this issue. It has very poor management and the back where the food is prep is dirty looking! Please email me at suzie980@gmail.com. thank you for reading this its very important.

 When I go to McDonalds, I can put money on the fact my order will be WRONGT. Unless I tell the counter person &quot;to pay attention to what I am ordering and make sure that it is what they put into the computer&quot;.

I happened to get an order today, took it home and SURE ENOUGH &quot; IT WAS WRONG.

This is not the first, second, tird, fourth, or fifth time this has happened,
I don&apos;t think that the people they hire are too bright or care, as long as they receive that MEGER pay check is all tha counts

SOMEONE BETTER STARTE MINDING THE STORE, OR MCDONALDS WILL GO DOWN THE DRAIN ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME. YOUR FEED BACKS COMMENTS DON&apos;T SOUND GREAT.

 I am a former employee of the store known as &quot;GB1&quot; in Glen Burnie MD my expierence there was very bad. First of all, over 65% of the staff are illegal immagrants who are very rude to citezens. The managment there plays favorites with its employees. They pick and choose who to give hours to not based on performance but who they like best. In one instance, I was 15 minutes late to work and was written up. The day before that one of my co workers came in an hour late and no one said anything to him. On top of that, they cut my hours down to two days every two weeks claiming that &quot;labor was too high&quot; yet they just hired another illegal to work in my place. Now does that seem fair to you? I traveled 15 miles to work everyday to make minimum wage only to have illegals take money out of my pockets. Thats not right and i feel some sort of action should be taken. 



 P.J 9/17/11 
 Your store at 7344 Sandlake Rd. in Orlando, Florida, is the worse store I have ever been to. The managers have horrible attitudes and they treat they&apos;re employess unfairly and they also choose favorites, I know because I work there. The managers would give their friends at work and outside friends free food and they stand around and talk while other, &quot;less popular&quot; employees have to keep working. They made me work while I had a messed up ankle and seeing as though I had to stand up for three and a half hours before they gave me a break and right after making mt stand up for another hour. They care more about their &quot;time&quot; in the drive through and their front counter than the quality of the food itself. There&apos;s flies everywhere by the food and they still use it. They even treat the customers bad! I would giveit negaive stars if I could. Terrible place!

 I went through the drive-thru this morning and ordered a new smoothie to try. I was told they needed to change the fruit and it would be a couple of minutes. I parked in the &quot;drive-thru spot&quot; where they told me too. I waited 20 minutes to never receive the smoothie I paid for and when I called to tell them how I felt So to speak the girl refused to let me speak to a manager and instead told me to come back and get it if I wanted it. That would be grounds for termination at my job and should be there too. I expect better things and more efficiency from such a large corporation inexpensive or not.

 SOMETIME IN MARCH OR APRIL OF 2011 I WROTE TO YOUR HEADQUARTERS TO TELL YOU IN SHORT THAT I WENT TO THE MCDONALDS ON 8TH. AVENUE BETWEEN 34&amp;35 STREET ACROSS FROM THE NEWYORKER HOTEL I ODERED A HOT CHOCOLATE IT WAS SOUR SO I TOOK IT BACK AND COMPLAINED SOMEONE ELSE MADE A SECOND AND THEN A THIRD THAT IS WHEN ONE OF THE WORKERS AT THE COUNTER SAID TO ME &quot;YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE COMPLAINING EVERYBODY ELSE THAT HAS ORDERED HOT CHOCOLATE HAS NO COMPLAINTS. I JUST LEFT THE STORE WITH OUT FURTHER COMPLAINT. IT IS NOT FAIR THAT I SPENT MY MONEY AT THIS LOCATION (WHERE A LOT OF DRUG ADDICTS ARE ALLOWED TO HANGOUT)BUT THE WORKING, PAYING CUSTOMERS ARE BE INSULTED BY THE EMPLOYEES. A FEW WEEKS LATER I GOT A LETTER FROM YOUR HEADQUATERS ASKING ME FOR THE LOCATION ADDRESS I DO NOT KNOW THE LOCATION/BUILDING NUMBER AND THAT IS WHAT I TOLD YOU IN THE LETTER I RETURNED ALL I KNOW IS THAT THIS MCDONALDS IS ACROSS FROM THE NEWYORKER HOTEL 481 8TH. AVENUE SO THIS MCDONALDS MUST BE 480 8TH. AVENUE.

THANKYOU D.BARKSDALE 212-686-7873.

 Reginald Handy 8/21/11 
 I have a big problem with the Mcdonalds at 7862 Highway 23 Belle Chasse, LA 70037. It seems like 85% of the time they get my order wrong. Today 8/21/11 I order hot cakes&amp;sausage just to drive to work 67.68 to Venice to see my order was wrong. What will it take to get the people at this location to start getting things right. This Mcdonalds will never see my business again. Are how bout opening a MCdonalds in Venice,LA that would be great. Not anything to big cause it&apos;s a small town bout sure would help.

 I live in Gainesville GA.... I live next to one location and i work next to the other.. i am very upset that u have taken away the honey packets but yet i have to pay for honey mustard, BBQ, Sweet and sour...why cant you order what the honey packets if were going to have to pay for it anyways... i refuse to go to either location bc of this.. i am very dissapointed and i think that you should allow this.. i use to eat daily at both locations.... until this is sloved you will have lost a daily customer!!!! so please bring back the HONEY PACKETS.... 



 Jimmy Fann 8/24/11 
 First off let me start off by saying that this is not about trying to get some free food cause it&apos;s not...But I live in kingsport tn and I always visit either your mcdonalds on john b.dennis or fort henry dr.and at both locations I have found hair in my food and I just really think that if your employees are going to be working around food you should makeit a requirement for them to wear hair nets. To avoid getting hair in the customers food

 8/27/11...Regarding McDonalds location 25100 Alessandro / Moreno Valley / Ca, Shame on the breakfast food /order served to us by you !!! Around 5:30am my husband&amp;I went through the drive-through ( above location ). After a late night&amp;had just taken a friend to the airport. We were both hungrey&amp;tired. The english muffins,biscuits&amp;pancakes were hard as a rock, tasted as if they had been over re-heated in a microwave. My order of oatmeal was not included. After arriving home&amp;tasting I had no other choice but to make breakfast myself. Due to the fact the inconvinience your staff put upon us ! I would give this meal a rating of - star. That wasn&apos;t given as an option. I called the location&amp;was told by the manager that the food was cooked at 4:30am. She&apos;ll check into it. Why should I have to save my reciept and go back for a refund ? More inconvience for me the customer...NOT ! Never will I eat at that location again. 



 kim bates 8/30/11 
 Customers complain a lot about mcdonalds restaurants try working there. Workers are not sure whether they are gettng paid all their hours. Getting a break is a JOKE you have to keep working because customers Keep coming in? Lucky if they can make it to the bathroom half the time. Yes mcdonalds is abusive to both CUSTOMERS and WORKERS. Try asking mcdonalds corporation why are you paying for a drink when its suppose to be part of your meal when its not. It clearly states on receipts that you are paying but they would tell you your not. Don&apos;t get mad at the workers and managers get mad at Mcdonalds Corporation they make up all the rules..CUSTOMER ARE NOT LOVIN IT AND NEITHER ARE THE WORKERS:( 



 Josh McCartney 8/31/11

I stoped and got me something to eat on my way home from work and I toook a bite of my burger and it tasted like it had some kind of chemical on it and it throwed it out the with window and I am sicker and a damn dog. That could of been my kid that ate it this is B.S 



 Janet L. 8/31/11 
 I&apos;ve had all the crap I can stand from the so called &quot;Im Lovin It&quot; Store. You are the most disrespectful and ill mannered business that ever was. Your business is hateful and rude to employees&apos;s and customers. It is damn pityful how you run your business operations. I was an employee there for 8 months and I sure the Hell was not &quot;lovin it&quot;! You do a good deed for hospitals supplying a Ronald McDonald House for Parents to stay in while there child or children are in the hospital, but that is all you are good for. My experience with McDonalds as an employee is disgusting, I was yelled and screamed at all the time, I stayed stressed out and upset the whole time I was there, they done all the other employees that way also. I am talking bout the store manager and all the shift manager&apos;s what is the damn deal with you people, you trained your managers to be mean, that is not the way to run and operate a business. I had a regular customer come through my line all the time, he was a daily customer, he spent $8.00-$10.00 a day everyday to eat there. This older type man is a handicap and disabled man, and a special needs person. He was slow at placing his order, and it took him 10 minutes to be able to get his wallet out of his back pocket. He would get his food and go sit at a table to eat he would sit at the store exactly 2 hours and eat and watch T.V. He nevered bothered anyone, he was a very friendly person. One day the store manager had one of her assisted managers go over and tell him he had been there to long and that he had to leave, and the store manager stood beside her while she said such cruel thing to that man. He didn&apos;t even get to finish eating his meal &quot;HE WAS A SLOW EATER&quot; I remind you. This man is now a customer at Hardee&apos;s they treat him with respect and dignity there. I saw him there last night ordering food; he told me all about his experience with your so called business. Do you even care who&apos;s feeling&apos;s you hurt. By the way I was having a interview with the Hardee&apos;s manager that is how I got to talk to him. He told me he will never go to McDonald&apos;s ever again- Who the HELL can blame the SPECIAL NEEDS HANDYCAPPED AND DISABLED MAN! To all the people who read this STOP GOING TO MCDONALDS. I have seen them drop food in the floor and manager watching and not say a word pick it up rewrap it and still serve it anyways because they don&apos;t want no waste, they say it cost to much to waste it. BAH HUM BUG ON YOU IDIOTS. Im taking that poor old man to see a lawyer and sue the Ronald Pants off of you. Im also going to place an Ad in the local newspaper about the store, and if I can a live T.V. news report. How is that for your slogan &quot;I&quot;M LOVIN IT&quot;!!!!!
May God Be My Witness This Is All True. The crap you have at the bottom of this page that you take no responsibility of any kind for the content which is posted, because you don&apos;t know the accuracy of the reviews. Let me tell you one thing THERE IS A GOD, AND THERE IS A HELL. DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WILL GO WHEN YOU DIE THINK REAL HARD ABOUT IT!!! People this is true I don&apos;t like to swear but anyway I SWEAR TO THE BOTTEM OF MY HEART IN GODS NAME THIS I JUST WROTE IS TRUE-TRUE-AND MORE TRUE.
THE ADDRESS TO THIS STORE IS IN---
