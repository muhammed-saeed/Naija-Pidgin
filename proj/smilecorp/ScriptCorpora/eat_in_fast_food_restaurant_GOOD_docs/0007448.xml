Consistently Good
 
I have been to this restaurant many times and continue to go back because the food is consistently good, the pricing is reasonable, ordering is easy, and the food is ready in a short time.

La Fogata has a wide selection of Mexican food. You can go there many times and still find something new to try. They also have a few American dishes like hamburgers and fries for those people who don’t enjoy Mexican food.

There is no table service at la Fogata. Similar to a fast-food restaurant you place your order at the cash register and pay in advance. When your food is ready your number is called. However the seating is more restaurant-like with traditional booths and tables. Mariachi music plays in the background. There is a salsa bar.

Pricing for most combination plates is around 7 or 8 dollars.

Tasty!
 
This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in this area. 
It&apos;s a sit down place but you order and pick up at the front. The enchiladas are really good!

Good Food
 
La Fogata is a tiny restaurant where parking is a problem. But don&apos;t let that stop you. The margaritas are wonderful, as is the taco salad. Park near the park and walk.

Mexico simple and good
 
Great little cafe with Mexican folk art-style design and charm. Lots of windows - sunny. Good sized, inexpensive and was packed at dinner. Faux margaritas for $3.75! I liked that you buy the food at the counter from a very large menu…
