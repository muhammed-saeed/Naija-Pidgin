Restaurant Reality Check
 
 News and Peter Romeo&apos;s views on the business behind the nation&apos;s favorite pastime.

 The phenomenon of the restaurant-supplier restaurant 
 
 From very different sectors of the country come two very
similar news developments. In Smithfield, Va., home of restaurant supplier
Smithfield Foods, you can now grab a sandwich or box lunch from Taste of
Smithfield, a restaurant opened by the company to showcase its meats. 
 Meanwhile, up where fast-walking people talk with a
different sort of accent, you can now treat yourself at midday to a“yogurt-infused”sandwich or salad at The Yogurt Culture Co., a new venture of
Dannon Co. The featured yogurts: Dannon’s, of course, but small-batch versions
rather than the familiar mainstream types you’d buy in a supermarket or deli.
The place is geared to grab-and-go business and, befitting its location in a
major New York business center, is open only for breakfast and lunch. 
 There’s always been crossings of the line between supplier
and restaurant or supermarket. Lawry’s, the seasoning, was a creation of
Lawry’s the restaurant. Toll House Cookies started as a restaurant product,
then became a product of Nestle, and are now being featured in a chain of
restaurants called Nestle Toll House Cafes. 
 You no longer have to use mail order to get Omaha Steaks,
thanks to the Omaha Steak House, and you can skip a trip to the supermarket or
big-box club and get a Bubba Burger at one of that company’s new fast-casual
restaurants. 
 The prime example remains Pepsico Restaurant Group, known
today as Yum! Brands. Its main brands, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, were once
holdings of the corporate giant. The objective was not so much to market Pepsi
soft drinks, but to move more fountain business through a major channel. Those
foodservice operations sell a lot of sodas, and the margins are incredible,
especially when you’re buying from yourself. 
 PRG, of course, is also the most pointed cautionary tale.
Because its chains were so large and such keen competitors for share of
stomach, many other restaurants balked at carrying Pepsi products. The
reasoning was, why strengthen the competition? 
 Yesterday’s entrants in the supplier-turned-restaurateur
field clearly won’t have that problem, since both are single outlets. 
 Yet, interestingly, both were touted as“firsts,”which
suggests others could follow. 
 I guess the Pepsi problem would be a good one to have. Posted by Peter Romeo at 4:51 PM No comments: 
 Don&apos;t overlook this restaurant milestone 
 
 The retirement of Jim Skinner two weeks ago as CEO of
McDonald’s drops the curtain on one of the greatest shows of leadership the
industry has ever known. Skinner took the brand when it was struggling, after
the two first picks of the board had died or been disabled by a terminal
disease, and led it to a success that would have been hailed in the best of
times. His backdrop was an economic meltdown unequaled since the Great
Depression. 
 And, true to McDonald’s form, Skinner leaves the company in
the capable hands of Don Thompson, a living example of Big Mac’s deep, deep
bench. 
 But his retirement ends an era for the restaurant industry
as well, as I was reminded in putting together a story on standout restaurant
executives who served in the military first. Skinner may be the last example
the business sees of an individual who climbed to the loftiest perches in the
restaurant industry without a college degree. 
 Yep, Jim didn’t have a copy of his diploma because he didn’t
get one. He took some business classes along the way, and was an officer in the
Navy, which means he underwent the service’s formal training for high
leadership posts. But, despite its obvious smarts, he didn’t have a sheepskin. 
 There are a few more examples elsewhere in the business, but
they lead chains that aren’t near the scale of McDonald’s. Jimmy John Liautaud,
the Jimmy John of Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches, famously chose the start-up
of a sandwich shop over attending college or entering the service, the three
career choices his father gave him. As Liautaud explained during a seminar at
the National Restaurant Association convention in May, he wanted to drink beer
and smoke pot, so he opted for business. And he succeeded because of smarts,
hard work, and the willingness to take a risk. 
 Still, Jimmy John’s is no McDonald’s. 
 There are plenty of other entrepreneurs who stepped off the
traditional high school/college/career track and found an alternative to their
liking in the restaurant business. Maybe their ventures will someday grow to
the size of a McDonald’s. 
 Indeed, that was a common story in the business at one time.
Knowledge of the business’nitty-gritty was more important than a degree, even
when a peaked-cap uniform was traded for an executive’s suit. 
 But, as the industry is discovering , the infiltration of
private-equity companies and the greater militancy of stock buyers are making
years spent at a fry station look far less essential for a restaurant CEO than
an MBA. 
 The entrepreneur may be the one who midwifes an idea, but
then professional managers take over. Certainly that takes some color out of
the business. But is that the only toll it takes?

 Future painted by Future 50 
 The strong showing of polished casual
chains (see below) was just one of the surprises in this year’s Future 50 ,
Restaurant Business’annual ranking of up-and-coming restaurant chains. Here
are some of the other ah-ha aspects: 
 
 There’s a rebirth of the pizza sector underway . Eleven of the 50 industry’s up-and-comers—22 %—are
pizzeria/Italian concepts. They range from Anthony’s to Zio’s . Alternate methods of
fueling the ovens, like burning wood or coal, seem to be the points of differentiation
from the old guard, along with using premium ingredients. 
 Breakfast/brunch/lunch (no dinner) concepts also had a strong showing in the growth rankings this year,
as did bakeries (including two cake
specialists, Nothing Bundt Cakes and Crumbs .) 
 Many of the concepts on our Future 50
list may be young, but the driving
forces behind them aren’t exactly neophytes . Among the veterans nurturing upstarts
are Nick Castaldo , formerly of Pollo
Tropical, now with Anthony’s Coal Fired Pizza (along with Hall of Famer Dan
Marino); Bill Baumhauer , formerly of
Champps Americana, Fuddruckers and Planet Hollywood, now with The Egg&amp;I ;
and Neil Newcomb , a co-founder of
McAlister’s Deli, now affiliated with Brixx Wood Fired Pizza .  Posted by Peter Romeo at 10:00 AM No comments:

 Is polished casual the fast-casual of casual? 
 Fast-casual
brands may be the cool kids in the chain-restaurant schoolyard right now, but a
rival clique is forming. Judging from the buzz, it’s a matter of time until
operators are pining to be part of that polished-casual crowd. 
 
 Consider
how prominently the emerging sector figures into Restaurant Business’ Future 50 report , an annual listing of the fastest-growing small-to-mid-sized chains
(defined by Technomic as having $25 million to $50 million in sales.) In past
years, the ranking abounded in concepts that are now major parts of the mosaic,
like better-burger joints, Korean-style fro-yo shops, or wings-and-beer
specialists. None of those were as prevalent this year as polished casual
chains. Six were on our just-published list, including Cru—A Wine Bar , Burtons Grill , Stanford’s , and Cooper’s Hawk . 
 Simultaneously,
the greybeards of mainstream casual dining are charging upmarket into the
polished tier. Look at the new siblings of Red Lobster and Olive Garden: Eddie V’s (No. 15 on our Future 50 list) and Wildfish Seafood Grille, which Darden Restaurants
purchased in a surprise deal. These aren’t the sorts of places where blue
collar consumers pack the booths for an all-you-can-eat crab deal. 
 They’re
more in the level of Seasons 52, Darden Restaurants’California wine bar and
seasonal specialist. 
 Ruby
Tuesday, meanwhile, is developing an upscale licensed concept called Truffles
Cafe, while switching some of its old and tired namesake restaurants to a new,
fresher, more polished brand called Marlin and Ray’s. 
 Clearly
investors are attracted to the sector. Bill Foley , for instance, is purchasing
J. Alexander’s after adding Stony River Legendary Steaks to the portfolio
through the acquisition of O’Charley’s. 
 And
Centerbridge Partners, a private-equity firm, is in the process of buying P.F.
Chang’s. 
 It’s
easy to understand why the action is shifting to the polished strata of casual
dining. There’s more of an emphasis on wine and liquor sales, and the food
portion of the ticket is considerably higher, yielding better returns on the
considerable investment in a sizeable restaurant. 
 But
the real driver might be the trend in consumer tastes, which can be summed up
in one word: Better. Better burgers, better coffee, better beer, better
cupcakes, better burritos. Why not better dining in a casual setting? 
 It’s
the same dynamic that’s remaking the quick-service sector. Everyone wants to be
in fast-casual, even longtime traditionalists like Taco Bell, Fazoli’s and
Pizza Inn. 
  Polished casual truly is the fast-casual of
casual. Posted by Peter Romeo at 11:14 AM No comments:

 Colorful duo behind the J. Alexander&apos;s buy 
 
 Today’s big news turns a spotlight on two longtime industry
figures who aren’t often center-stage, despite strong claims to stardom. 
 Bill Foley is the more familiar of the two, a carry-over
more from his days as the kingpin behind Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s and several other
regional chains, from Taco Bueno to Rally’s. At one point he ran a veritable
restaurant empire, but more remarkable was how he got started. 
 Carl Karcher, the Carl in Carl’s Jr., ran into trouble
because of some real estate deals. Because the parent of Carl’s Jr. was a
public company, a rescue of the concern’s founder was a dicey business for the
home office. The company’s CEO and Karcher had a very visible struggle for
control of what Carl, a textbook entrepreneur who started with a hotdog cart,
had built through the sweat of himself and his family.  
 The very public battle
was waged on radio stations and in newspapers within Carl’s stronghold of southern California. Public
sympathy was clearly aligned behind Karcher, but that didn’t bail him out of a
mountain of debt. 
 Enter Foley, who headed what at the time was believed to be
the nation’s largest title insurance company. Like a white knight on noble steed, Foley provided the money to
rescue Karcher from serious financial difficulties. But, in the process, he slickly ended
up controlling Carl’s Jr. and the concepts it later amassed, including
Hardee’s, Green Burrito and a host of other smaller brands. Karcher was
gradually phased out, and Foley became the burger king. 
 The purchase of the Hardee’s regional burger chain and the
subsequent acquisition of its largest franchisee, Advantica, mired Foley’s
restaurant diversification in trouble, and, after a 12-year run, he stepped
out. 
 From the standpoint of the industry, he virtually
disappeared. Indeed, if he was known at all, it was as a supplier to high-end
eateries. He bought a bunch of wineries in Napa and Walla Walla, Wash., and was
reported to be in Montana, enjoying his wealth and wine. 
 Then he popped up again in 2007 through the purchase of
several small, Montana-based restaurant chains. We’re talking about such powerhouses
as MacKenzie River Pizza Co., Mambo’s, Craggy Range Bar and Grill, and Corner
House Grille. With not much more than a dozen or so units, Foley seemed as if he was
buying a diversion, if not a place where he could have some food with
his wines. 
 Obscurity briefly returned, with the notable exception of
Foley’s emergence as one of the bidders for Wendy’s. 
 Now he’s back in remarkable force. Taking advantage of the
industry’s downturn, he snorked up Village Inn, Bakers Square and Max&amp;Erma’s, all of which had gone bankrupt. 
 O’Charley’s and its little sisters, the Stony River
Legendary Steaks and Ninety Nine casual chains, followed. 
 Then, on Friday, his Fidelity National inked a $72-million
deal to buy J. Alexander’s, a polished-casual concept that many have likened to a lower-ticket
Houston’s. 
 If the deal goes through, according to Fidelity, Foley will
have a portfolio consisting of 674 restaurants and six concepts. 
 Which brings us to the other figure involved in the
J.Alexander’s deal. With the pending retirement of Ruby Tuesday’s Sandy Beall,
Lonnie Stout II may be the longest serving CEO in casual dining. He’s definitely been one of the more distinctive. Long
before Warren Buffett made the CEO’s annual letter to shareholders something
that investors actually read, Stout was using that podium to go far beyond the
usual pap. 
 In one of the more memorable installments, Stout laid
out the travel policies he’d set for himself and the rest of J. Alexander’s
team. This was at a time when CEOs&apos; self-pampering and perks worthy of kings were prompting investors to yelp about too much indulgence. 
 J. Alexander’s investors needn’t worry, Stout convincingly
argued. When it comes to travel, for instance, budget hotels like Red Roof Inns
were just fine for him and the executive team. And if the company’s leaders
should ever drift away from that frugality, the shareholders were to call him
and snap them back, loud and pointedly. 
 Stout&apos;s post-acquisition fate was not disclosed in the announcement of the purchase. Other strong executives who&apos;ve been brought into Foley&apos;s fold, like O&apos;Charley&apos;s CEO David Head and concept chief Marc Buehler, were smartly kept in their posts.  
 In any case, it&apos;ll be fascinating theater, watching these two characters while
they uncharacteristically wear the limelight. Posted by Peter Romeo at 3:53 PM No comments:

 What&apos;s happening in the restaurant business 
 
 What kind of days are these for
restaurants? It’s time to take a quick pulse check. 
 Concept-o-rama: Not long
ago, you would’ve been hard-pressed to name a new restaurant concept that
deserved more than a yawn. Most were just scaled-down versions of a struggling
brand looking to cut its costs and facilitate expansion. 
 Today is a different story. Starbucks
alone has three ventures in the works that could probably survive on business from
rivals checking these potential Next Big Things. The chain just revealed that
it plans to open a Tazo“tea bar”in Seattle this fall to showcase 80 signature
teas, available straight or in custom-blends. For those of you keeping store,
this is in addition to the La Boulange bakery chain, which it intends to grow
outside of the Bay Area, and Evolution Fresh juice bars, only one of which is
currently open. 
 Here’s another one for the new-format
list: Pret A Manger is working on a suburban version internally christened Pret
Local. Insiders describe it as more of a traditional fast-casual concept, where
customers will be presented with their orders instead of having to grab the
salads and sandwiches off shelves. 
 Experienced operators wouldn’t be
hatching new market entrants if they weren’t confident the consumer demand and
supply of capital were there to foster growth. 
 Indulgence is on the surge: Consider the tourism lure that Philadelphia flycast onto the
internet yesterday. Not one bargain was touted. Nor did the announcement play
up Independence Hall or the city’s other historical attractions. Instead, the hook
was a chance to sample milk shake after milk shake at the city’s dining
outposts. 
 Or if you prefer something a little
harder core, literally, there was a run-down of the ice creams, frozen yogurts
and other frosty treats that a visitor can sample. 
 It was food tourism in a 16-oz. cup. 
 Restaurants 2, puritans 0 :
Establishments in two temperance zones could soon have an easier time of
slaking customers’thirst for something stronger than birch beer. Utah’s
legislature voted this week to grant 90 more liquor licenses to restaurants in
the Mormon stronghold. Remember, this is the state where you can’t mix drinks
in the open because the seduction of making an Old Fashioned could lead kids
down the wrong road. Ninety licenses in a state that measures 85,000 square
miles isn’t going to change the culture, but it’s a step in the right
direction. 
 Meanwhile, outdated restrictions on
drink promotions continue to be beaten back. Hayward County in California’s
Silicon Valley voted yesterday to allow restaurants and other alcohol servers
to drop the price of drinks between 4 and 9 p.m. You can even feature live
music! But dancing remains verboten. Posted by Peter Romeo at 1:33 PM No comments:

 Did we go too far? 
 
 Will you put the weapon down so we can talk about this? Some
of you are pissed, big time, because of the nuclear option Tom Feltenstein suggested this issue in a roundup of tactics for besting the competition. Okay, in this
instance the projected outcome was the death of a rival restaurant. And that,
you’ve screamed loud and clear, is going too far. 
 Strangely, the flashpoint isn’t the tactic itself but the
matter-of-fact observation that it could force a competitor to close. Before
publishing the article in our Skills section, we discussed Tom’s recommendation
because it definitely went beyond offering superior food or service. Some might
call it a dirty trick. 
 He advised restaurateurs who see a sparkling new competitor
open nearby to snuff it right away, not by starving it of business but by
sending too much traffic its way. The idea was to feed the newcomer more volume
than its staff and inventory could handle, leaving customers frustrated and
unlikely to return. 
 “Let’s say your new neighbor,“Burger Emporium,”is planning
its grand opening a block away from your fast food restaurant,”Tom wrote.“You
take out a full page ad, inviting all the customers who share a the same
trading area to go to the Burger Emporium grand opening. Also run a direct mail
campaign conveying the same message to 10,000 people in the zip codes you share
with your competitor. 
 “A store that used this incredibly powerful tactic ran its
competitor right out of business shortly after its grand opening.” 
 Who knew Tom could be so diabolical? (Those of you with your
hands raised can e-mail me at promeo@cspnet.com .) 
 One of you called to alert the editorial team that we had
one less subscriber. Other love missives were delivered via e-mail. Given the
count of how many people read the story online, we’re likely to get more of
those mash notes in the days to come. 
 Obviously we don’t regard a potentially lethal marketing
idea to be a sacrilege for the industry. Isn’t generating casualties the blue-sky
objective of any ad campaign, menu revamp or chef change? They’re called killer
ideas for a reason. 
 And what’s the alternative? Aiming only to make rivals a
little hungrier, not to starve them? To leave them marginally profitable, just
not fat and happy? 
 That’s our position, though we’re open-minded enough to
reconsider. We know what the First Objectors think. What we’re wondering is the
take of everyone else. Did we let Tom go too far? 
 In return, we leave you with this quick listing of the Five
Most Controversial Stories in Restaurant Business’publishing history: 
 --A cover story that looked at the not-so-subtle prejudice
in some industry quarters against gay employees. One letter written in response
addressed me as Mr. Homeo. 
 --An editorial insisting that guns have no place in
restaurants, a response to the National Rifle Association’s announcement that
it planned to open a shooting-themed eater-tainment place in Times Square to
teach the world that firearms and foodservice are a wonderful match.   We can’t take credit, but the restaurant was
never built. 
 --A cover story headlined“Bloody Murder,”looking at the
prevalence of shootings in restaurants. The cover was a silhouetted gun, the
tracing of a pistol brought in by a staffer for that purpose, set against a
blood-red background. Many readers thought it was too lurid. Some of us on the
staff agreed.   
 --A cover story that looked at a statistically proven racial
bias in tipping. New research showed that African-Americans tipped less than
Caucasians, validating a widely held contention among servers. We looked at how
the disparity had prompted full-service chains to avoid black neighborhoods,
and what some people were doing in the industry to resolve the issue. The angle
was, How does the industry address this issue without looking prejudiced? The
reaction we often caught: Just running the story is proof of your bigotry. 
 --A quote from Lee Iacocca in a story about KooKooRoo, in
which he’d invested something like $10 million after retiring as the head of
Chrysler. To draw dollars from a savant like Iacocca anointed the home-meal
replacement chain as a concept to watch. But to quote Iacocca’s quote,“I don’t
give a fuck about KooKooRoo.” Posted by Peter Romeo at 3:00 PM No comments: Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
