Roberts Group | Brethren | Garbage Eaters 


This group does not have a formal name. However, in the media it is often referred to&quot;The Brethren,&quot;or as&apos;The Roberts Group&apos;after its
founder and leader, Jim Roberts.
Unofficially, members refer to themselves or to their movement as:

 The Brethren The Brothers and Sisters The Church 

The media, researchers, and family and friends of those who have joined the group also refer to it as:

 The Roberts Group 
After its founder, Jim Roberts, a reclusive man referred to by members as&quot;The Elder.&quot; The Garbage Eaters 
Called thus by the media and researchers because members eschew work in favor of foraging for food in garbage dumpsters 

Apologetics Index refers to this movement as The Roberts Group, in reference to its founder and leader.

The group is a cult , both sociologically and theologically. Theologically, the Roberts Group is a cult of Christianity - by virtue of the fact that its teachings and practices run counter to those of orthodox
Christianity.
 
 They believe they are the only&quot;true&quot;church in America, the end-times remnant of the church inspired by Jesus Christ and
 advanced by his earliest disciples.

They assiduously avoid the police, their parents and the media. To them, the world - and especially the United States - is a hopelessly wicked Babylon,
 its established churches little more than houses of deceit.

Their leader is Jim Roberts, a one-time Marine and Pentecostal preacher from Kentucky who established the group in 1971. He is known to members as&quot;the Elder&quot;or&quot;Brother Evangelist.&quot;He does not claim to be a deity, but is without question their all-powerful leader. He does not live
 extravagantly and there are no signs of the excesses of some other gurus: no fleet of Rolls Royces, no armed bodyguards, no public-relations apparatus
 churning out pro-Roberts spin. In fact, his behavior is downright Victorian. But important decisions - where members will roam next; whether and whom they
 will marry - all flow from him. Dissent is not tolerated and violators face excommunication, equated with losing one&apos;s soul.

Members typically are idealistic youths plucked from college campuses all over America, from Harvard to Humboldt State on Califor-nia&apos;s foggy north
 coast. They forsake all: family, material possessions, promising futures. In their wake, inevitably, are grieving, bewildered families. - Source: In the shadows , San Diego Union-Tribune, USA, Nov. 10, 1997 /cite&gt;


 
 Jimmie T. Roberts&apos;&quot;Garbage Eaters&quot; is yet another example of a&quot;far out&quot;nomadic religious cult
 experiencing great trouble recruiting new converts. 
 Roberts, the ex-Marine from Paducah, Kentucky, calls himself Brother Evangelist. His youthful followers dress in long robes, follow the Brother
 around from city to city, eat out of garbage cans, and practice&quot;free sex.&quot;Why all this&quot;sacrifice&quot;for Roberts? He claims that his
 children are God&apos;s chosen people. The Brother tells his converts&quot;no marriage license, no minister, no vows.&quot;He teaches them to speak what
 is reported to be a&quot;foul tongue&quot;as these&quot;dirty nomads&quot;practice Roberts strict cult religion. Female members are taught by the
 Brother to obey their cult husbands and that&quot;child abuse is God&apos;s way of ensuring obedience.&quot;Roberts urges his female followers to beat
 their children, claiming that this is necessary for their salvation ( Sneed, 1979). 

 Jimmie T. Roberts&apos;movement took shape about eleven years ago when he preached that God saved many people from the Great Flood and He would
 also save the Brother&apos;s converts. This is when Roberts sought recruits from college campuses. Over the years the movement has not proven very&quot;successful.&quot;If anything, he has lost most of his members because they have found that the Brother&apos;s requirement that they follow him,
 crisscrossing the country looking through restaurant trash cans for food, is more than they bargained for ( Sneed, 1979). - Source: The
 Cult Experience , by Andrew J. Pavlos. Greenwood Press, Westport, CT. 1982. Page 163 
 
In 1998 the group was featured on ABC&apos;s Prime Time:
 
 And now, we bring you a report on what has been called one of the most secretive and impenetrable religious cults in this country.

They are known as The Brethren or more commonly the Garbage Eaters because of the way they live. Experts say over the years, they and their leader, Jim
 Roberts, have targeted religious college kids and convinced hundreds of them to reject their parents and disappear into the shadows.

There was a time, of course, when parents tried to seize and deprogram these kids. But in recent years, many courts have made that difficult. So
 tonight, the parents have come to television with a message - tell your children to be beware of these strangers quoting scriptures from the Bible.

(Voice Over) You may have walked right by them in a crowd, bearded men in tunics who look pious and a little strange. Look closely, because some parents
 believe they are scriptural robots assigned to target and capture your college - age children.

Here at Berkeley, they stand on street corners and strike up conversations at random. To the spiritual kids, they quote from the Bible and promise a
 life of certainty. The lonely kids, they offer support.

At Columbia University, they lure students with a provocative question - do right and wrong exist? They offer a place among God&apos;s chosen with such
 intensity that in days, sometimes hours, students drop out and disappear.

They are nomads. Recently, some of them camped in this house in Cleveland, tacking scriptures on the walls, even on the mattress. They move secretly
 from state to state in cells of a handful of people. They live off food from garbage dumpsters.

This is a video taken years ago behind a fast - food restaurant in Minneapolis. Two brothers dumpster diving, combing through, picking at half - eaten
 sandwiches. And experts tells us everything they do is controlled by the whims of one man - the enigmatic founder, Jim Roberts, whom they call&quot;the
 elder.&quot;These are the last published photographs of him in 1975.

The parents believe he is a bizarre, unstable religious fanatic who steals the minds of promising kids, some from the best universities in the country -
 Harvard, Brown, Northwestern - leaving their anguished mothers and fathers desperate to find them. - Source: The Brethren: Parents Seek Kids Lost to This Controversial Cult , ABC Prime Time, USA, Mar. 25, 1998

 The Brethren: Parents Seek Kids Lost
to This Controversial Cult , ABC Prime Time 


And now, we bring you a report on what has been called one of the most secretive and impenetrable religious cults in this
country.
They are known as The Brethren or more commonly the Garbage Eaters because of
the way they live. Experts say over the years, they and their leader, Jim Roberts, have targeted religious college kids and convinced hundreds of them to

JIM FOSTER (PH), KRAIG&apos;S (PH)FATHER He&apos;s right there. He&apos;s right there. He&apos;s right behind the sign.

PAT FOSTER, KRAIG&apos;S MOTHER Where?

JIM FOSTER See him?

PAT FOSTER Oh, my God!

JIM FOSTER No. No.

PAT FOSTER It&apos;s not?

JIM FOSTER I thought it was. False alarm. Sorry about that.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Jim Foster has been looking for his son, Kraig, for 14 years. Kraig was a warm, smart business major at Humboldt State University in
California, when he met and succumbed in only one week to a recruiter for The Brethren. On the other side of the country, Charles and Dorothy Rooney (ph) have
traveled from Boston to New York to spend yet another weekend looking for their son, Patrick. She says she had always worried, but about the wrong things.

DOROTHY ROONEY, PATRICK&apos;S MOTHER Drinking and alcohol and AIDS. I worried about a lot of things, but I never worried about this. I didn&apos;t know there
was any â¦

CHARLES ROONEY, PATRICK&apos;S FATHER Any kind of such danger existed.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Their boy, Patrick, was a popular athlete, a nationally ranked skier in high school and a skateboarder. His parents say he was not even
particularly religious. Yet two weeks after meeting a recruiter for The Brethren, he sold his gear, quit college and has never called home. His parents are
baffled that their gregarious kid became the withdrawn figure in this surveillance photo taken by another parent.

CHARLES ROONEY We&apos;re going to have pick things up a little bit here â¦

DIANE SAWYER (VO) This day, following a lead, the Rooneys spot two Brethren on Staten Island and follow them secretly to corner them on the ferry.

CHARLES ROONEY Do you belong to a group called the Jim Roberts group? Or The Brethren? We&apos;re looking for my son. My son&apos;s name is Patrick.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) The brothers are cold and unmoved.

DOROTHY ROONEY You&apos;re not listening, are you? You&apos;re not listening.

CHARLES ROONEY Do you know what we&apos;re talking about? Do you understand that kind of an inner feeling and love for people, particularly family, your own
family?

DIANE SAWYER (VO) The brothers finally say they don&apos;t know Patrick. For the 20th time in a year and a half, the Rooneys go back home empty-handed.

CHARLES ROONEY Now his second older brother&apos;s getting married, and he wants Patrick home to be the best man. (Crying)

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Before they left the ferry, the impassive men in the tunics sent a message. Repent.

JIM SIEGELMAN, CULT EXPERT They use the Bible practically to tie a rope around these people&apos;s mind.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Jim Siegelman and Flo Conway (ph) have studied cults for 20 years. They say the Roberts group hijacks kids with lightning speed by using
what their parents taught-high moral standards, respect for the Bible.

JIM SIEGELMAN They&apos;ll talk to students. They talk to people for a couple of hours, and someone will say,&quot;I&apos;m not sure I want to go off with
you. Let me think about this.&quot;They go,&quot;If you think about this, the devil is going to pluck the seed we&apos;ve planted from your mind.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (on camera) Does it mean their parents did something wrong?

JIM SIEGELMAN No, I&apos;d say more often than not, it means their parents did something right. Their parents let these kids be open-minded.

1ST FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER There is a place in Bible where Jesus said a man&apos;s enemies will arise out of those-his own family. But Jim Roberts turned
that around and presented a case that everyone in your family is your enemy.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) These former Brethren, all devout Christians, were members of the group ranging from 14 months to 15 years. They say Roberts promised a
truly spiritual life but ruled with a weapon of fear. (on camera) But families, the Bible is full of families.

1ST FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER You had no choice because it was a package deal. If you communicated with your family, you were put out of the group. In his
mind, he was sending them to hell because, you know, that was what it meant to leave the group in his mind.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) They told us submission to Roberts and his brethren began with isolation and a gradual loss of identity. They changed their names to
Hebrew, spent six and seven hours a day studying the Bible and singing hymns like this one.

FORMER BRETHREN MEMBERS (singing) And how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) And copying scripture in tiny uniform handwriting. They not only gave all their possessions and money to the group, but in the name of
piety, gave up their laughter and joy.

2ND FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER We weren&apos;t allowed to show emotion. It&apos;s not that it wasn&apos;t there. We just weren&apos;t allowed to show it.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) The rule in his group is no sex without marriage. But the former members say Roberts has allowed no marriages in the last eight years.

2ND FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER I remember Jim Roberts telling me once that looking leads to liking, liking leads to lusting and lusting leads to sin.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) The women did the cooking and cleaning and were told to keep their heads down and be shame-faced. The men did the recruiting and foraging
for food. The former members showed us how and told us one male in every cell sent reports to Roberts. But even through suffering, people remained obedient.
The former members said abscessed teeth would go untreated. So would broken bones because Roberts allowed no outside medical care. They told us a child had
died from lack of medical care. (on camera) Did you want to say to them take the child to a hospital?

3RD FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Well, I did tell the sisters that short of taking the child to a hospital, you know, it will die.

2ND FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Even though many of us would have liked to seen this child taken to the hospital, we wouldn&apos;t dare say-suggest it.

DIANE SAWYER Does it seem inconceivable to you now that you stood by as a child was dying?

2ND FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Yeah.

DIANE SAWYER What do you think he cared about the most, Jim Roberts?

4TH FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Control.

1ST FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Yes.

4TH FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Bottom line, control.

1ST FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER Yes. Control.

DIANE SAWYER But who decided when you would move and who would go where?

1ST FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER He decided all of that.

2ND FORMER BRETHREN MEMBER He was a man of mystery, which led you to believe that there was a holiness about him because you didn&apos;t know him.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Roberts was the son of a Paducah, Kentucky, Pentecostal minister-a poor student who, after a stint in the Marines, ran a hairdressing shop
before forming a religious group of his own in the&apos;70s. Today, he&apos;s said to be bizarre, spacey, a wanderer. He&apos;s been seen using pay phones to
send instructions to his lieutenants like this man, Jonathan, a cell leader in Berkeley. These former members who once lived by his instructions say they left
the group 10 years to 20 years ago because somehow they came to see him as more a manipulator than leader. (on camera) What advice would you give to parents
terrified that their child will wander into this? (No response)

DIANE SAWYER Silence. (VO) It&apos;s hard to know how to protect your children when their good intentions are what make them vulnerable.

JUDY WILCOX, BART&apos;S MOTHER He was the all-American kid.

LARRY WILCOX, BART&apos;S FATHER The kind of child that you pray for.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) It has been seven years since Judy and Larry Wilcox&apos;s son, Bart, a former exchange scholar in South Africa-an athlete, a
Christian-sent his mother this hand-drawn birthday card from the University of Idaho, thanking her for being such a great mom. A few days later, he met a
member of The Brethren. Another letter arrived.

LARRY WILCOX&quot;Mom and Dad, I&apos;ve dropped out of school. I&apos;ve given everything away. Don&apos;t worry about me.&quot;DIANE SAWYER (VO) And not
long after that, a bombshell-in the tiny scrawl used by the other Brethren.

LARRY WILCOX It said&quot;God willing, this will be the last time you ever hear from me.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Months later, as they were searching for Bart at this Portland house, he ducked out a window while they went in the front door. And then,
last year in Phoenix â¦

LARRY WILCOX In many cases, we tried to get to him. In some, we barely missed him. In one, I walked by him.

JUDY WILCOX And didn&apos;t know it.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Bart was lying nearby, asleep on a bench. Today, the Wilcoxes pass out flyers and maintain a Web site in hopes of finding their son. But
this is one of the men who tries to make sure they can&apos;t. That lieutenant of the Berkeley cell, Jonathan. We saw him hauling garbage back from a dumpster.
But when we asked him about it, he bristled.

JONATHAN, THE BRETHREN CULT MEMBER A friend of mine found these. But what&apos;s wrong with that? If people want to say you&apos;re Garbage Eaters, then maybe
they need to rethink it.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) We did some research on Jonathan and were surprised to learn that he keeps a personal bank account, an inheritance of thousands of
dollars. And unlike many of the others, he sometimes sees his family. So when we saw him once more biking to a pay phone, we followed. As we said, that&apos;s
how he gets instructions from Jim Roberts. (on camera) Are you talking to Mr Roberts?

JONATHAN No, I&apos;m not.

DIANE SAWYER Could I speak with him?

JONATHAN It&apos;s not him.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) He refused to shake my hand, saying he doesn&apos;t touch women. So we asked about the three young men whose parents are in such pain-the
Wilcoxes, the Rooneys, the Fosters. (on camera) Is it possible for you to tell us where Kraig Foster is?

JONATHAN No. I don&apos;t know where he is.

DIANE SAWYER Can you tell us where Bart Wilcox is?

JONATHAN I don&apos;t know that either.

DIANE SAWYER Patrick Rooney.

JONATHAN I don&apos;t know who he is. I don&apos;t know where those people are.

DIANE SAWYER Can you tell us someone who can find them for us? Can you help us find them?

JONATHAN They&apos;re OK.

DIANE SAWYER You don&apos;t know them, but you know they&apos;re OK?

JONATHAN Well, excuse me. I do know Patrick. I know all three of them. At first, I didn&apos;t know who you meant, but I do know. They&apos;re fine.
They&apos;re fine. Their parents know what they&apos;re doing.

DIANE SAWYER Why-are parents the enemy?

JONATHAN It&apos;s really grievous. Sometimes they can be, OK? Sometimes they do. They do. They have, in the past, kidnapped their children. They&apos;ve
taken them by force.

DIANE SAWYER But not recently. Nobody&apos;s been taken by force.

JONATHAN We&apos;ve been hiding for that reason, so they can&apos;t do it.

DIANE SAWYER But you see your parents?

JONATHAN Yeah?

DIANE SAWYER Yeah.

JONATHAN Well, I have.

DIANE SAWYER Yeah, so why can&apos;t they?

JONATHAN It&apos;s their choice. It is. It&apos;s their choice.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Before we left, we made one more try with Jonathan. Would he at least deliver to Bart Wilcox some letters from his family. (on camera) As
God is your witness, do you promise to deliver these letters?

JONATHAN No. I don&apos;t. I don&apos;t promise.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Reluctantly, he agreed.

JONATHAN I&apos;ll take the letters, but you guys are really grievous. You all are really grievous. You&apos;re painted up like jezebel. You, yeah, it&apos;s
sickening. You are all really grievous people.

DIANE SAWYER (on camera) In a moment, you&apos;ll see what happens when some parents do find their children. But as you can imagine, there is often
heartbreak in these stories. You remember the Rooneys, the parents we saw on the Staten Island ferry at the beginning of this piece? Well, in an earlier
expedition in search of their son Patrick, some other parents were taking surveillance photos as Mr Rooney-he&apos;s there in the light baseball cap-talked to
one of The Brethren. When the Rooneys came home and looked at the photos, they realized that their son had been standing only a few feet away from his father,
who didn&apos;t know it.

(Commercial Break)

ANNOUNCER A dramatic meeting between a mother and son she could barely recognize, years after his disappearance into a shadowy group.

GEORGIA BUSWEILER I got face to face, and I just said,&quot;Do you know me?&quot;

ANNOUNCER And watch PrimeTime&apos;s surprising encounter with the reclusive leader of The Brethren, when PrimeTime continue after this from our ABC
stations. (Station Break)

ANNOUNCER PrimeTime-from New York, Diane Sawyer.

DIANE SAWYER As we said, the law now makes it difficult for parents to seize their children. Of course, presuming that they can find them, and only Jim
Roberts knows where they are among The Brethren. Beyond that, our experts tell us that members of this group are particularly hard to talk out. So what are
parents to do? Take the case of a young man who disappeared three years ago and what, in some ways, is the most baffling recruit of all. (VO) At age 25, Don
Busweiler (ph) was a vibrant young entrepreneur with a lucrative clothing line called Pervert worn by Janet Jackson and other stars. He&apos;d been a model
himself and owned his own clothing store in South Miami Beach. But it was stressful, and suddenly, one day he tossed his belongings into the Atlantic and said
he&apos;d found God with The Brethren. That was three years ago. These are surveillance photos of Busweiler taken in California. And when his mother, Georgia,
saw them, she flew out to find him.

JIM FOSTER That&apos;s a brother right there.

GEORGIA BUSWEILER, DON&apos;S MOTHER That&apos;s not Don.

JIM FOSTER No. That&apos;s not Don.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) She was helped in her search by another parent, Jim Foster, whom you met at the top of our story. For four days, they searched together
futilely.

GEORGIA BUSWEILER I just feel like it&apos;s hopeless. I just feel like I&apos;m not ever going to find him.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Then last week, Georgia got word that Don had shown up in Houston. There he is, sitting in a cafe, perhaps trying to recruit someone, when
his mother walks into the door.

GEORGIA BUSWEILER I was getting close, and I&apos;m like, he&apos;s not reacting. He&apos;s just staring at me, and I was staring at him. I got face-to-face
and I just said,&quot;Do you know me?&quot;And he said,&quot;Yeah, ma.&quot;And I lost it. I hugged him, and then I just asked him,&quot;Please don&apos;t
run away.&quot;And he said,&quot;I&apos;m not going to run away.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (VO) He told her he was pursuing a life with God and that The Brethren are now his family. He said he hadn&apos;t called her for fear she&apos;d
kidnap or try to deprogram him. She promised she wouldn&apos;t but said she needs him in her life. After eight hours, she was about to leave when he surprised
her.

GEORGIA BUSWEILER He said,&quot;Ma, come here.&quot;And he grabbed me and hugged me. It was like so great. I still can&apos;t believe he did it. I was just
so happy and fortunate just that I got to hug him and let him know how I feel.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) But the next day, he refused to meet with her again. At the end of last week, he returned a call but told her he was staying in the
group.

GEORGIA BUSWEILER I&apos;m just going to give it some time, and hopefully he&apos;ll keep in touch with me. Because I told him if he did that, I wouldn&apos;t
be searching all over the world for him. And all he did was keep telling me he&apos;d pray about it.

FLO CONWAY, CULT EXPERT These parents are up against artillery in terms of the kind of programming that these people are going through 24 hours a day.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Again, experts Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman. They say there&apos;s no magic phrase that can snap someone out of the hammerlock of a
cult.

JIM SIEGELMAN That&apos;s why this phenomenon is so insidious because these people can be in that waking trance state for years at a time and tell you that
they totally believe that they&apos;ve made a free choice, that they totally believe they are in control of their mind.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Which brings us back to Jim Foster, who has spent $75,000 and 14 years looking for his son Kraig. Kraig-the loving boy, the Eagle scout,
the college business major. Who, before he vanished, sent his parents this letter.

JIM FOSTER&quot;I don&apos;t know when I will contact you again, probably not for a while.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (VO) During the course of this piece, Jim Foster got word that Kraig had been sighted in New Orleans. He gathered his wife, Pat, and
Kraig&apos;s older brother, Keith. They had rehearsed this moment for years-how they&apos;re remind him of the old days, how they&apos;d mount a psychological
assault with love. With their binoculars and video cameras, they had parked across from this rundown house near the French Quarter, when another member of The
Brethren came up and accused them of stalking. Jim started an intense negotiation. He said other members could stand guard if only he could speak to his son.
After 14 years, finally Kraig came riding up. The 18-year-old was now 32. He didn&apos;t hug them and spoke mostly by quoting scriptures.

PAT FOSTER I didn&apos;t sense that he was feeling anything. It was all rote. All- everything he said was related to scripture that he&apos;d memorized.

JIM FOSTER Kraig told us that he was loving us by remaining separate from us.

PAT FOSTER But he didn&apos;t even want to smile. I said,&quot;Do you ever smile?&quot;And he said&quot;I try not to.&quot;

JIM FOSTER We&apos;re a threat to him. Because if we get through to him, and he leaves the church, to him, he&apos;s going to hell.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Kraig gave them only an hour. They could feel time running out.

KEITH FOSTER, KRAIG&apos;S BROTHER It felt really powerless to reach him. I told Kraig that I feel caught between wondering whether to grieve for him
permanently or to hope for him to return. And his immediate response was&quot;grieve me permanently.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Kraig climbed back on his bike and rode off. As he left, he asked them to stop searching for him. They made no promise.

JIM FOSTER I told him, I said, you know,&quot;I&apos;ve not agreed to anything here.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (VO) When he was almost out of sight, his brother Keith walked toward the fence.

KEITH FOSTER I shouted out, you know,&quot;I love you, and I miss you.&quot;

DIANE SAWYER (VO) And one more thing happened in the course of our report. One day, we were staking out a Brethren house in Richmond, California, when a man
walked by. We wondered, did he look familiar? The next day a PrimeTime producer followed him as he walked to a bus stop. As impossible as it seems, this was
the man from that old 1975 picture of the elder.

PrimeTime PRODUCER Mr Roberts, I&apos;m with PrimeTime.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) Out of the public eye for 23 years, Jim Roberts surfaces again-strangely jumpy and nervous. We noticed his hair looked dyed, and he seemed
to be carrying a computer case. We said we wanted to know about his group.

JIM ROBERTS We no ways believe that we&apos;re a cult.

PrimeTime PRODUCER What about your views on family? A lot of people feel like you are encouraging your members to cut their ties with their families.

JIM ROBERTS Well, sometimes we do that because of what Christ taught.

PrimeTime PRODUCER And what is that, sir?

JIM ROBERTS Well, maybe at a later time, I could speak with you.

PrimeTime PRODUCER OK, well, would you? How could I reach you?

JIM ROBERTS Pardon?

PrimeTime PRODUCER How could I reach you?

JIM ROBERTS Well, I need to catch this bus now.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) We remembered what one of the parents had told us.

PARENT Like the vampires, I don&apos;t think Jim Roberts can stand the light of day. And he doesn&apos;t want to be in a position where he has to defend what
he does.

DIANE SAWYER (VO) And how does he answer the other scriptures, the one that says,&quot;Honor thy father and mother?&quot;The one that says,&quot;Return
to the parents for this is acceptable in the sight of God?&quot;(on camera) And the parents say one thing you can do is tell your children about groups like
this, warn them to be on guard. You can get more information on this story on our Web site at abcnews.com on the Web or AOL.

 Drag that murder into a court of law... what is wrong with this generation??? This man needs more than a trip to the woodshed. I am surprised that he still
lives..that some parent or ex member has not tapped him on the head with a acme safe dropped from a cliff. He is a murder! A killer.. and should be made
accountable.

And if he is not taking Money than I bet his whole no looking no sex thing does not apply to him.. and how can you have free sex and no sex.. There is alway
two points in the three point power grid of any meglomanic.. money, power and sex.. find me a cult that is not functioning on two of these three and this guy
is clearly a meglomanic. Secretive.. you bet and I am guessing he has lots of secrets..ugly evil ones that would make grown men cry. Into court with him.. he
is a child a satan.. and should be punished for his crimes.. murder being one of them..

 God Willing 
 Â  

 
 March 19, 2011 
Â 


 God Willing is a powerful exploration of a 35-year-old American religious sect known as âThe Churchâ or âThe Brotherhood.â It also outlines the struggles of families whose children turn away from them to become âBrothersâ and âSistersâ in the group, renouncing their past lives and the world â often, without ever turning back. 
 
 Founded in 1971 by shadowy messianic figure Jim Roberts, the group has survived for decades as a separatist society that preaches a strict path to salvation, proselytizes for new members, adheres to strict ascetic values, subsists on discarded food and refuse, and shuttles its members from town to town, often on the run from concerned parents and family members who try to see or communicate with their children.
 
 
This documentary offers an inside look at the group, offering searing testimonials from both family members and former members of The Church.Â The film details the appeal of Robertsâ message to the sincere spiritual needs of young people, and the struggle that some of them face with fellow members and themselves when they find little more comfort in the fold than they had in their previous lives.
 


 

 It also grippingly presents the anguish of parents and other loved ones who grapple with the urge to pursue and rescue their children, and the psychological, emotional and tactical impediments that so often get in the way of reconciliation.Â  

 Extensive surveillance footage of Brothers and Sisters and rare, candid on-camera encounters further enhance this examination of families torn asunder, belief systems at war, and the perilous balance of futility and hope.

 GOD WILLING will air April 2nd at 11AM / 4PM / 9PM / 2AM / 5AM ET and again April 3rd at 7PM&amp;5AM ET on these PBS affiliates.

 Understanding Cults,
&quot; God Willing&quot; 
April 2, PBS 
 
 by Bob Etier


 March 31, 2011 



 Filmmaker Evangeline Griego âs nephew, Daniel, left home and became a member of the nomadic Jim Roberts Group , also known as The Brethren and The Garbage Eaters (because they eschew working in favor of foraging supermarket dumpsters for salvageable food). After he returned home she began work on a documentary, God Willing , an examination of The Brethren and families who have lost their children to the group. 

 God Willing will be shown on Public Television stations beginning April 2, 2011; check local listings for dates and times. Included are several former members of The Brethren who severed ties and returned to their families; they share some of their experiences and opinions about the group. 

 There are over 5000 cults in America; the Jim Roberts Group was founded in 1971 by Roberts, a âmysterious messianic figureâ who has not been seen in public since 1998. The group is allegedly Christian, with a strong reliance on scripture, but thatâs scripture as interpreted by Jim Roberts. âThe group has survived for decades as a separatist society that preaches a strict path to salvation, proselytizes for new members, adheres to strict ascetic values, subsists on discarded food and refuse, and shuttles its members from town to town, often on the run from concerned parentsâ¦â 

 Video of one mother who reunites on the street with her daughter after seven years is heartbreaking. Although the daughter does not reject her mother, she is far from welcoming and refuses another meeting because she has âthings to do.â Other parents report that they havenât seen their son in 22 years, since he ran off and joined the cult.

 Membership of the Jim Roberts Group is estimated at forty to sixty adherents, although the exact number is not known. Members joined with âsincere spiritual yearnings,â what once would have been called âmissionary zeal,â and renounced their past lives and the world. 

 Soâ¦what does Jim Roberts get out of this? There is apparently no financial gain for him, so is being âmasterâ of a group of indigent people the attraction? Isolating them from their families, negating their sexuality (even marriage is frowned upon), and relegating women to a subservient roleâis that a power trip? And what happens to the group when he dies (since he does all the thinking and planning for them)? 

 God Willing is a melancholy look at lives and families destroyed by a cult, and the commitment parents make to liberate their children. While some families reunite, others remain fractured with parents who havenât seen or heard from their children in years. For some, the only time they have seen their children is when theyâve been caught on videotaped surveillance of one of the groupâs camps.
