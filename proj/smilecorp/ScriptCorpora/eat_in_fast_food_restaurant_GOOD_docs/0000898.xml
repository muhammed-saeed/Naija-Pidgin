Can you please pass the salt? [or pepper, mayo, gravy, sour cream, mustard, chili, vinegar, hot sauce, cheese, ice cream...]

I love french fries. Who doesn’t? Growing up, I always had my fries with good ol’ketchup. But as the years passed, I started trying new things. I’ve eaten them with many different dips—from plain mayo or gravy to gourmet chipotle mayo or creamy chocolate ice cream [preferably a Wendy&apos;s frosty]. We have all heard of a poutine (gravy and cheese curds) or chill cheese fries, but have you heard of a smoked meat poutine? a Mexican poutine (meet, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, hot sauce)? A lumberjack poutine (gravy, cheese, sausages and a fried egg)? I only found out last summer at this unique poutinerie and I knew I just had to try it! Calorie count? Forget it! I love trying new foods!

 Working at a fast food restaurant, you’d probably get sick of burgers and fries. For many of us, that is the case. It really is no fun coming home wreaking of fast food while watching your dog lick away at the grease on your arm. But for the very few like me, I like to challenge my palate by constantly experimenting. I’m known for coming up with some delicious and weird combinations in both fast food and in ice cream [and sometimes a mix of the two—fries with a mix of gravy and ice cream isn&apos;t that bad].

It was working there that I noticed how everyone was eating their fries. One guy used to have four ketchup cups lined up with his fries. Some people sprinkle tons of salt and soak their fries in vinegar. Others have it with mayo, or a mix of ketchup and mayo. In fact, it was working there that I first tried mayo with my fries. Not bad. Then I tried the mix of ketchup and mayo. I fell in love. So tasty! Sweet, creamy, salty. Yum! And then I took it up a notch and made it my own by adding just a tiny squeeze of mustard for a bit of sharpness. Ever since, I’ve stuck to that tasty trinity. And sprinkling black pepper all over the hot fries before dipping is perfection! 

But only yesterday did I have them with vinegar for the first time. Shocking? Maybe, but I wasn’t the only one trying it for the first time. In fact, two others I was working with had not tried it either. So what did I do? Well I got us each one french fry and we dipped it in a tiny cup of vinegar. The french fry was long enough to dip it three times to really taste it. We all thought the vinegar flavour would be strong but in fact, it wasn’t even as strong a flavour as salt and vinegar chips. The vinegar soaks into the fries and it’s quite nice actually. What’s next? Malt vinegar. Maybe I should go out for fish and chips! In the meantime, I’ll stick to my tasty trinity.

About madtos
After spending 20 years living in the vision of a bright future, I now want to live in the present and just enjoy every minute while it lasts. I have been so focused on building a stable future for myself and devoting my time to school, work, relationships and friendships that I passed on so many opportunities to enjoy my youthfulness. This year, I lost everything that made me who I am; everything that mattered; everything I looked forward to. Now I need to find myself again. I need to dig deep and find what I want and who I want to be. Along that journey, I want to do things, see things and learn things I never have before. I&apos;m not rich, but I&apos;m a dreamer. I don&apos;t expect to be skydiving or climbing mountains anytime soon, but I want to take chances, face my fears and just live and love life and all it has to offer. View all posts by madtos »
