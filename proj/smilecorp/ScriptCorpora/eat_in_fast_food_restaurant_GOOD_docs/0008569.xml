New restaurant opening at A Perryville Place in Rockford
 Posted on February 7, 2011 at 6:30 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
Perry Rock is a new restaurant expected to open next month in the former Table 13 space at A Perryville Place in Rockford.

Abbie Shepp was a manager at Table 13 and is venturing out on her own for this new project. Table 13 closed in July. The space, 6957 Olde Creek Road, also operated as a restaurant called Ember Restaurant&amp;Bar.

Shepp hopes to open Perry Rock by March 1. She describes the menu as featuring“American bar food with a twist.”The plan is to serve food until 1 a.m. most days to give customers more options for late-night dining.

The chef for Perry Rock is Matt Martin, who recently returned to Rockford after working for several years in Las Vegas. Shepp said Martin worked at several high-profile restaurants along the Vegas strip.

Shepp is also from Rockford.

“We want to give Rockford something different, like Chicago casual dining,”Shepp said.“It’s a far cry from what Table 13 was. It’s different, and hopefully Rockford will embrace it.”

The plan is for Perry Rock to be open for lunch and dinner daily. Hours will be 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday.

Shepp said workers are taking down a wall between the dining room and the bar to open up the space a bit. The decor will include all new chairs and lots of high-top tables and bar stools for a more casual feel.

A website for Perry Rock should be up soon, and Shepp said she plans to use Facebook for marketing.
