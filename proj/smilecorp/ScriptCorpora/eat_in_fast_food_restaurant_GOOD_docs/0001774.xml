I had the same attitude when I turned 16. There&apos;s cashier at any retail store, and then there is the person who stocks shelves. Are there any industrial companies that you live close by? The fact of the matter is that since you are 16 now you will most likely get the job nobody wants, but if you show a good work ethic, you will be moved to better positions later on. I also advise you pick a job that is near an area to what you would like to be doing as a career later on. What I mean is, skills you learn at that first job can also be aplied to a career you would like to be doing later on. One thing I wished I had done when stocking shelves was learning how to do accounting from my boss. That was an opportunity I could have taken, but didn&apos;t think of it. Always find new things to learn at work.

It&apos;s always hard to find work for teenagers, but now it&apos;s nearly impossible.

You may have to settle for making work yourself, as suggested above - walking dogs, babysitting, pulling weeds.

If you are good online, you might be able to start an online site and sell on Amazon, Etsy, or E-Bay, altho an adult might have to help you set up the account.

It helps if you can find something you like to do, but all jobs have their very dull parts, and all of them, even fast food, can be a learning experience. You&apos;ll certainly meet a lot of people!

You could work at a store like Target or Safeway. Retail stores can be much more fun than working at a fast food restaurant. I wouldn&apos;t want to work there either.

Another place to work could be to start your own business. You could mow lawns or babysit for people. This can be a large money earner. I have mowed lawns for people in the past and got paid very well. One of the guys paid me $45 per time I mowed his lawn.

There are plenty of places for a 16 year old that would include some perks.

working as a clerk in your favorite clothing store - discounts on clothes
movie theater attendant - discounts on movies
lifeguard - water park attendant - discounts on pool use and water park admission

If I was 16 in today&apos;s world, I would never work fast food, retail, or anything like that. I would get on Webanswers and start answering questions. If you can do a little research and can write, you can make more money here than you can in a typical job. I started making $3 to $4 a day immediately and now make much more than that in just one month. If you have patience and persistence, you could end up making more money eventually than any teen job will bring you. Also, go to Hubpages and start writing some Hubs. It is free to start and the traffic is good. Youth targeted Hubs will bring you great traffic, especially concerning fashion, music, and movies.

When I was 16, I found a job in a college&quot;hang out&quot;restaurant that was great! The pay was much more than other guys my age, and the work was really fun. We got to listen to good music, eat free food, and meet a lot of people.

Another option that is a lot of fun is working at a music store. You really get to meet great people and have lots of fun and great conversation.

If I were you, I would start my own business.

As a teenager you could do lawn work, babysitting, dog walking, pet sitting, or even house cleaning. Consider being self-employed and entrepreneurial by starting your own company. And yes, even teenagers can have their own business.
