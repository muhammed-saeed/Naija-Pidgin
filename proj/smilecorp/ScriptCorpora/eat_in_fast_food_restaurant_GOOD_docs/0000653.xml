 VILLAGE OF BREWSTER v. MERRIEWEATHER ESTATES 
 Date of Decision: May 14,2012

 [Condemnation]
[In order to install underground sewer pipes, a section of the subject property measuring approximately 1,985 square feet and running through the center of the parcel was taken in eminent domain. Claimant&apos;s appraiser testified that the highest and best use (pre-taking) of the residentially zoned vacant parcel was &quot;single family residential&quot;, despite the fact that, at 5,710 square feet, it fell well below the 7,500 minimum lot size required by the 1991 Village Zoning Code. The Village&apos;s appraiser opined that, because of its non-conformity with the 1991 Code, coupled with its non-accessability owing to its &quot;land locked&quot; location (determined by a viewing during which the parcel and its surroundings were snow covered), the highest and best use of the subject was as an &quot;assemblage parcel&quot;. Claimant&apos;s appraiser agreed with the latter assessment, but argued that the subject&apos;s status was reduced to &quot;assemblage&quot;
usage only post-taking, after a center strip, measuring approximately a third of the property, was excised by the partial condemnation. In this post trial decision, the Court agreed with claimant&apos;s appraiser as to highest and best use and valuation, based on his opinions that the property, which pre-dated the 1991 Code, not only fronted on a public street (albeit unpaved and unimproved), but also met all minimum size, depth, and width requirements of the Code, which contains a grandfather clause permitting the use and improvement of pre-existing, dimensionally non-conforming lots. In addition, testimony in the record from the assessor of the Town of Southeast established that notwithstanding the fact that prior to 2005 the Putnam County Board of Health had denied applications for approval of sanitary facilities on certain undersized lots, in or about 2005 the State of New York determined that undersized lots could not be deemed unbuildable solely due to the lots being considered too small to support sanitary facilities. Based on that determination, neighboring lots, including one immediately adjacent to the subject, were granted Board of Health approval, and the Village assessor, after 2005, increased the assessment of the subject from $45,000 to $117,500. As such, only site plan approval from the local Building Department would be required for development of the subject, as witnessed by the fact that one adjoining undersized lot (having obtained Board of Health and Building Department approvals) had already been improved with a duplex home.] 

 AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PAPER MILLS SUPPLY COMPANY, INC.
v VILLAGE OF TARRYTOWN 
 Date of Decision: May 4, 2012

 [Tax Certiorari]
[ At a pretrial conference in July, 2010, an oral agreement was reached, and certain terms were set forth, with regard to tax years 2004, 2007, and 2008. In October, 2010, in order to effect the settlement, petitioner sent a draft stipulation or proposed Consent Judgement to counsel for the Village, which latter counsel rejected as not consistent with his understanding of the agreement as related to tax year 2007. In December, 2010, a new draft Consent Judgement incorporating the Villages proposed changes to tax year 2007 was forwarded to respondents counsel. The Villages counsel amended the new draft stipulation/Consent Judgement to change the assessment for yet a different tax year, 2008, again in conformity with his understanding of the agreement. He then signed the now revised draft stipulation/Consent Judgement, and delivered it to prior counsel for petitioner. The latter, however, declined to sign it, and inquired, by letter dated several days later, why the changes were made. In February 2011, petitioners prior counsel then sent an appraisal to the Village, and by letter invited a conversation regarding a revised settlement in light of this new appraisal. Subsequently, petitioner also sought to have the matter restored to the trial calendar, but neglected to file a Note of Issue relating to tax year 2007 on or before April 30, 2011, the last date of the four year period within which a note of issue must be filed.
The instant matter involves motions by petitioner for an Order compelling specific performance of a settlement agreement and/or Consent Judgement, pursuant to CPLR 2104; or, in the alternative, for an Order nunc pro tunc extending the time within which to file a note of issue pursuant to RPTL 718 (1). The motions were denied with the Court finding that:
(a) The matter was abandoned since within the four-year period following the commencement of the action, the parties did not stipulate to extend the period, nor was there any application to the Court for an Order granting, on good cause shown, an extension of the time period; and (b) there was never any final agreement between the parties as to the terms of the Consent Judgement since the corrections made by the Village&apos;s attorney to petitioner&apos;s proposed Consent Judgement constituted a counter offer which was rejected by petitioner&apos;s attorney.] 


 Legion of Christ, Inc. v The Town of Mt. Pleasant 
 Date of Decision: December 16, 2011

[Tax Certiorari - Religious Exemption]
 [Petitioners brought a motion for an Order granting partial summary judgment on their petition seeking a religious exemption (for tax years 2002 and 2003) pursuant to RPTL 
 420-a(1)(a) and 420-a (3). The Court found that petitioners met their initial burden of demonstrating entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, by showing that the parcel is and has for many years been used for religious, educational, and recreational purposes, by providing, as its application states, a place of quiet meditation, reading, studying, and group discussions for Roman Catholic priests, laymen, and seminarians, as well as an area for outdoor religious activities, including Stations of the Cross, a Rosary path, and a Grotto. In response, respondents asserted that no building permits were sought by petitioners for the work done, and therefore the described work, supportive of the religious use, had not been accomplished. The Court found such assertions to be meaningless, however, when the 
 outdoor structures - the Grotto (a statue of Mary on a rock, surrounded by an open space for prayer), the Outdoor Chapel (an open area with movable benches, a stone altar, and a crucifix), and the Stations of the Cross (which were added to an already-existing path) - referred to by petitioners in their application, were not buildings within the meaning of 218-3 of the Zoning Code, and thus did not require building permits. Based on the above, and the inadequate assertions of the assessor, the Building Inspector, and the Police Chief, respondents failed to show the existence of any reasonable questions of fact on the issue of whether such uses actually took place, and petitioners&apos; motion for partial summary judgement was granted.] 

 AAA Electricians, Inc. v. Village of Haverstraw 
 Date of Decision: December 9, 2011

[Condemnation - Highest and Best Use - Valuation]
[Post-trial Decision/Order/ Judgement in Claimant&apos;s EDPL Article 5 proceeding challenging the valuation of its 18.9 acre river front property by the Village. Condemnor/Village, urging that the highest and best use of the property was &quot;light industrial&quot; made an offer for the taking of
 $2,596,150. AAA, based upon the substantial size of the property, its excellent location with superb Hudson River views, and sewer and road access opined that its highest and best use was as a multi- family residential/condominium development. With a per unit valuation of $47,000, AAA estimated its total valuation to be $16,300,00. After a thorough analysis, the Court rejected the Village&apos;s methodology, conclusions, and comparable property evaluations and adopted AAA&apos;s highest and best use conclusion. Rather than a per unit calculation of value, the Court determined that a per acre analysis and calculation was more appropriate, and utilizing Claimant&apos;s comparable properties, but with modifications to a number of its adjustments, arrived at a final conclusion of value of $6,500,000.] 

 New York Funeral Chapels, Inc. v. the City of New Rochelle 
 Date of Decision: September 14, 2011

[Tax Certiorari]
[Property was originally purchased in 1970 by Frank E. Campbell - The Funeral Church, Inc.
Article 7 petitions were filed in 2006 and 2007 by New York Funeral Chapels, Inc. (NYFC) and by Campbell Funeral Chapel, Inc., c/o SCI Funeral Services (Campbell/SCI) in 2008-2010. The City, alleging that Frank E Campbell was the true owner, moved to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(3) for lack of standing of the latter two entities. The Court determined that the motion was untimely since the City did not file its objections until several months prior to the trial of the five years of petitions. Even if timely, the objections would fail since, upon analysis, 
(1) The petitions naming Campbell/SCI, were valid since they were the true owners of the property for the 2008-2010 tax years, and (2) the naming of NYFC , the manager of the premises and a subsidiary of the actual owning entity, is a technical defect, and thus is not only waivable but curable by amendment. Accordingly, the cross-motion by petitioner to amend the petitions relating to the 2006 and 2007 petitions, to substitute SCI Funeral Services, Inc. as petitioner on each, was granted.] 

 Matter of the Village of Spring Valley 
 Date of Decision: August 23, 2011

[Condemnation - Trade Fixtures Claim - Discovery - Motion to Compel Response to Interrogatories]
[Pursuant to prior Court Order, condemnor served a set of Interrogatories on claimants which sought, inter alia, trade fixture appraisals, mortgage applications, leases, certificates of occupancy, tax depreciation schedules, tax returns, surveys and building plans, and business loan applications. In response, claimants informed the Village that they were rejecting the Interrogatories in toto, alleging that said interrogatories included material which exceeded and was outside the scope of the Order. By the instant motion, the Village sought enforcement of the Order and sanctions for noncompliance with same, and Petitioner cross- moved to strike the interrogatories.
Condemnor&apos;s motion was granted to the extent indicated in the decision and otherwise denied; petitioner&apos;s cross-motion was denied in toto. The request for sanctions was denied with leave to renew in the event that there is any noncompliance with the instant decision and Order.] 

 Matter of The Stop and Shop Companies, Inc. v. Assessor of the City of New Rochelle, et al 
 Date of Decision: May 25, 2011
[Tax Certiorari]
[Respondent&apos;s motion to dismiss alleged that petitioner, as fractional lessee and not the true owner of the property, was not an aggrieved party, and therefore lacked capacity or standing to bring petitions in its own name. In response, petitioner asserted: (1) that (pursuant to Matter of Waldbaum v. City of New York) petitioner had standing since the lease gave petitioner either the right to require the landlord to bring an Article 7 proceeding or (as is the case here) to require the owner to permit the tenant upon its request to bring such a proceeding in its own name, and (2) that, in any event, respondents&apos; motion was untimely and prejudicial since it was made on the eve of trial, between 2 1/2 and 5 years following the commencement of the various actions, at which time respondents were given actual notice that the petitions were brought in the name of the fractional lessee and not in the owner&apos;s name. Respondents&apos; motion to dismiss the petitions was denied.] 

 Michael F. X. Ryan v. Town of Cortlandt, et al 
 Date of Decision: March 10, 2011
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioners motion for renewal and/or reargument, or for vacatur pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(3) denied for the reasons stated in the decision. Petitioner&apos;s assertion that payment of a single filing fee to cover several consolidated matters constituted a new fact or facts justifying reargument and/or renewal of prior Order rejected. In addition, petitioner&apos;s failure to comply with R.P.T.L. 708(3) required dismissal (with regard to the school district) in two separate respects. He not only failed entirely to serve the Notice of Petition and Petition upon the School District, in violation of the statute, for three consecutive years, but he also failed to file affidavits of service of such notice with the Court within ten days of such mailing, again for three consecutive years.] 

 Matter of The Village of Spring Valley 
 Date of Decision: January 26, 2011
[Condemnation - Trade Fixtures Claim - Discovery - Interrogatories]
[Motion by the Village for discovery by way of the taking of depositions upon oral questions denied for lack of showing of necessity, however, as a matter of discretion, the Court allowed service of interrogatories upon the former fee owners of the parcels at issue, and the various trade fixture claimants related thereto, with respect to the cost, design, acquisition, dates of installation, manner of installation, operation, maintenance, and use of the fixtures alleged to be compensable.] 

 Megamat Laundromat, Inc. v. The Village Of Port Chester 
 Date of Decision: January 10, 2011
[Condemnation - Trade Fixtures Claim - EDPL§701 Application]
[Claimant brought the instant motion for additional allowances pursuant to EDPL§701. The trial court&apos;s finding of $1,104,026 as the current sound value of the trade fixtures was reversed and remitted for recalculation, with the Appellate Division finding the court&apos;s total CSV award (nearly twice the original cost for constructing and equipping the entire laundromat approximately four years earlier) to be a&quot;windfall.&quot;Upon remand, the trial court calculated a total amended award of $539,993.99 plus interest. condemnor argued that additional compensation should be denied since the reduced award only barely exceeded the Village&apos;s proof at trial of $419,939. Claimant countered that the award, even as reduced upon remittur, is several times the condemnor&apos;s pre-vesting offer of $110,105, which occasioned the necessity of appraisal fees, trial expenses, etc. The court agreed that, in order to achieve just and adequate compensation, claimant was entitled, under§701, to an allowance for attorney fees, appraisal costs, and appropriate costs and disbursements (upon re-submission of a proper bill of costs), but reduced the amount of legal and appraisal fees to 50% of the amount sought - based upon claimant&apos;s pursuit of a valuation theory which was squarely rejected upon appeal, which constituted an amount substantially in excess of the recalculated amount, and which played no role in the courts revaluation of the trade fixtures.] 


 Matter of Hampshire Country Club v. Town of Mamaroneck, et al 
 Date of Decision: November 16, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[While this matter was being readied for trial, including by the preparation and timely pre-trial exchange of appraisal reports, petitioner disclosed that the subject property had been offered for sale, and that several parties had expressed interest in the property. Respondents asserted that the negotiations ultimately resulted in a sale of the premises for $12,100,000.00. Consequently, the Town and the Village both served notice upon counsel for petitioner pursuant to CPLR 3120, seeking disclosure of the details of the sale. Petitioner declined to comply with the disclosure notice, and respondents filed the instant motion seeking said disclosure. Petitioner opposed the motion for several reasons, including the untimeliness of the request as served on the eve of the scheduled trial of this matter. Since the items noticed by the Town and the Village for discovery and inspection by petitioner relate directly to the facts and circumstances of the recent sale of the subject premises, the items are material and relevant to the factual issues in this tax certiorari matter. As the applications were promptly made for the sought-after information upon discovery that the sale had occurred, the Court directed petitioner to comply with the previously-served discovery notices.] 

 Michael F. X. Ryan v Town of Cortlandt 
 Date of Decision: November 15, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[Croton-Harmon School District sought leave to intervene in the instant tax 
 certiorari proceeding as well as relief from the effects of a stipulation 
 between respondent town and petitioner for lack of service on the district
 superintendent. Petitioner challenged tax assessments for tax years 2007 through 
 2009 for the subject premises. The town settled the matter for assessment 
 reductions in each year, and petitioner presented the stipulation to the
district seeking refunds. The district argued petitioner failed to timely serve 
 the superintendent as required. It also argued proof of service was not properly 
 filed with the court. The court noted failure to serve notice on the district, 
 whether through lack of service or misdirection of service to an incorrect 
 party, mandated dismissal absent a showing of good cause for such lack of
service. Also, it stated a lack of prejudice could not supply the &quot;good cause 
 shown&quot; to excuse a total lack of service, as occurred here, rather than untimely
 or improper service. The district, in recognition of the prior settlement, 
 sought only to be relieved from the binding nature of the settle on the district 
 only. The court granted intervention as well as relief from the effect of the
stipulation on the district.] 


 Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. City of Mount Vernon 
 Date of Decision: November 29, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[In 2006, petitioner MTA, a public benefit corporation and public authority pursuant to Article 5 of the Public Authorities Law, leased the subject premises for the purpose of housing a MTA Police Department Station to assist passengers in furtherance of its commuter railroad business. In August, 2009, MTA requested that the City grant an exemption for the subject premises pursuant to§1275 of the Public Authorities Law. In September, 2009, the City Comptroller responded that OTR, the owner of the premises, was not a tax exempt entity. MTA then corresponded with the Corporation Counsel, and was directed to the City Assessor who replied in November, 2009 that he had the authority to grant the exemption and was consulting with an expert on the matter. Thereafter, MTA never received a determination. The instant Article 78 action, challenging the denial of its request for an exemption, was filed upon receipt, in early 2010, of the 2009 tax bill. The City opposed the application arguing that the instant action was time barred as commenced more than four months following its determination conveyed via the Comptroller&apos;s September, 2009 letter regarding OTR&apos;s non-exempt status. The Court, agreeing with MTA&apos;s position, determined that MTA was entitled to an exemption for leased property devoted to Authority business, and that the action was not time barred as the time within which to commence an Article 78 action begins to run when the determination by the municipality becomes final, here, upon receipt of the tax bill in 2010.] 


 Marianne Shoecraft and AKA Realty Partners v Town of North Salem 
 Date of Decision: November 15, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner and her now deceased husband purchased the subject home and property in 1999 for $2,250,000.
At the time it was in an advanced state of disrepair and, in response to a challenge filed by the prior owners, the assessment was significantly reduced that year. Petitioner commenced a series of extensive renovations, repairs, and upgrades to the property during the succeeding years. In 2001, the former assessor, having observed substantial work at the property, increased the improved and total values by $100,000. By 2003 and 2004, the total value was increased by an additional $327,750 and the improved value by $300,000.
The trial of the instant matter involved petitions filed in 2005-2008, and, after an extensive analysis, the Court reached the following determinations: (1) From 1999 to the date of trial the Town had neither conducted a Town wide reassessment, nor did it have in place a comprehensive plan (with proof of methodology) to increase valuations based on the equalized costs of improvements to similarly situated properties - any increases to the assessment of the instant property were therefore the product of unlawful selective reassessment: (2) any pre-2005 errors in valuation may not be considered by the Court since (a) there is no evidence that timely challenges to those assessments were made nor were petitions filed for those years and (b) no appraisals or expert testimony were introduced as to valuation errors by respondent for those years; (3) the petitions for the years 2005-2007 were sustained to the extent that the assessment for each year should not have exceeded the 2004 value of $760,750; and (4) the 2008 petition was not sustained where the assessment was reduced by $162,400 - a 25% reduction which is over $35,000 less than the 1998 value with all parties conceding that substantial improvements, likely valued at nearly $1,000,000, occurred at the premises in the interim.] 


 Mavis Tire Supply Corp. v. Town of Ossining 
 Date of Decision: September 23, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner&apos;s motion to reargue Court&apos;s November 17, 2009 Decision, Judgement, and Order [25 Misc.3d 1231 (A)]
was granted to the extent that the final adjusted derived market values for the tax years 1990-2000 were revised as indicated based upon a determination that the testimony of respondent&apos;s appraiser was not accurate as to the size of Comparable Property #1, that he had grossly underestimated the size of the property with the actual dimensions rendering it too large to be effectively utilized as a comparable, and that it should not have been used (and relied upon by the Court) to determine value at the trial of this matter. Respondent&apos;s cross-motion for reargument with respect to the presumption of validity and requirement for substantial evidence was denied.] 


 Matter of Village of Dobbs Ferry v. Stanley Avenue Properties. Inc., et al 
 Date of Decision: September 14, 2010
[Condemnation]
[In a post-trial decision dated November 8, 2007, the Village was ordered to pay the sum of $1,372,750.00 (less any amounts previously paid) plus interest, costs, and allowances to Stanley Avenue Properties for the calculated cost of the loss from the taking. The Court did not, however, direct submission of an Order or Judgement on notice pursuant to 22 NYCRR§202.48. Subsequently, although both parties filed notices of appeal, neither was perfected due to a combination of factors which included the effect on the remainder parcel of construction of a DPW facility on the condemned property, and settlement negotiations between the parties which produced an apparent agreement whereby the Village would not be obligated to pay on the condemnation award in exchange for a commitment by Stanley to build an affordable housing project on the remainder property with financing provided by the County of Westchester and an increased density allowance by the Village. When the negotiations irretrievably broke down, Stanley submitted the Judgement (which had been deferred for the approximately twenty-nine month period of good faith efforts to resolve the matter) to the County Clerk, who declined to accept the Judgement absent an Order of the Court. The Court, finding
22 NYCRR§202.48 inapplicable, and the late submission of the Judgement excusable for good cause shown, denied the Village&apos;s motion to deem the compensation award abandoned, and granted Stanley&apos;s cross-motion for an Order directing the Clerk to enter Judgement.] 


 Rockland Hebrew Educational Center, Inc. v. Village of Spring Valley, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 8, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[In this RPTL Article 4 and CPLR Article 78 proceeding, petitioner and its principal, Rabbi Naftali Weinstein, challenged the revocation by the Village of the Center&apos;s previously enjoyed real property tax exemption. The Rabbi and his family resided in the premises where he conducted numerous acts in furtherance of the petitioner&apos;s non-profit religious and educational purposes including preparation for and the conducting of religious services, outreach education with unaffiliated Jewish children, authoring of religious books and pamphlets, counseling people on religious matters, production and delivery of Jewish holiday goods, and engaging in fund raising activities. In this post-trial decision, the Court determined that even though the Village failed to disprove that the primary use of the premises was the conducting of religious activity in conformance with the Center&apos;s avowed religious purpose, the holding of religious services at the site in knowing violation of the Village zoning code was a complete bar to eligibility for a RPTL§420-a(1) exemption. Since the evidence showed that the Rabbi presided as clergyman for the Center and that he and his family resided at the premises, petitioner was, however, found to be entitled to a&quot;Parsonage Exemption&quot;under RTPL§462.] 


 Matter of Hansen v. Town of Red Hook, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 9, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[Following enactment of a local conservation easement law, petitioners voluntarily entered into a conservation easement agreement dedicating a portion of the subject parcel for conservation uses in return for a 75% partial tax exemption. Upon application, the exemption was denied by the assessor based upon the alleged illegality of the Agreement and the Law. Petitioner filed an Article 7 petition challenging the denial of the exemption. The instant motion to dismiss the action was brought based upon improper service upon the superintendent of the school district. The motion was denied with the Court finding that the service procedure utilized in the case complied with RPTL§708 (3). Here, petitioners&apos; attorney called and spoke to the superintendent&apos;s personal secretary who notified him that she and the superintendent would be unavailable for personal service at the time the attorney intended to personally deliver the papers, but directed him to serve the notice and petition upon another named district employee who would then bring the papers to her for delivery to the superintendent upon his return from vacation. The attorney followed the instructions and later confirmed that the notice and petition were received by the secretary and superintendent, and then conveyed, per district policy, to the tax collector.] 


 Washed Aggregate Resources, Inc. v. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
 Date of Decision: August 31, 2010
[Condemnation]
[Claimant purchased the subject parcels for $675,000 immediately prior to their taking by the MTA in eminent domain to facilitate the construction of a new commuter railroad station, an adjacent parking lot, a rail access road, a railroad car storage yard, and the creation of a grade crossing incident to the new station and parking lot. The properties had been utilized at varying degrees of output for the mining of sand and gravel reserves prior to the taking. The instant action was commenced to challenge the valuation and pre-vesting offer by the MTA of $37,611.00 for the direct taking, and to seek compensation not only for the 12.7 acres which were the subject of the direct taking, but also for consequential damages resulting from the loss of the ability to conduct mining operations on the remaining portions of the parcels as a result of the taking. After an exhaustive analysis, the Court determined, in this post-trial EDPA Article 5 decision/order/judgement, that the complainant was entitled to consequential damages as a result of the diminution and/or exclusion of access to the parcels caused by the taking and the improvements thereon. In computing damages, the Court rejected claimant&apos;s discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis which, computed over a 20 year period, yielded an estimated $11,515,556 in damages for the mineral preserves which were unable to be mined as a result of the taking. The Court, utilizing its own analysis and adjustments, awarded the amount of $65,000 for the direct taking and $435,000 in consequential damages for a total of $500,000.00, with interest thereon from the date of the taking, July 27, 1998, less any amounts previously paid, together with costs and allowances as provided by law.] 


 County of Rockland v. Donald A. Lucca, Jr., et al 
 Date of Decision: June 28, 2010
[Condemnation]
[The respondent-owners/condemnees had previously unsuccessfully challenged the taking of their property by the county and the direction by the Court, based upon the existence of two apparently unsatisfied mortgages on the property in addition to the condemnees&apos; competing interest, that any advance payment funds be deposited with the county clerk, rather than being remitted directly to the condemnees. The instant motion to reargue challenged only that portion of the Order which directed the deposit of the funds with the Court urging that Chapter 1161 of the Laws of 1971 (relied upon by the condemnor as authority for the deposit of advance funds with the County Clerk) was repealed by the EDPL which was subsequently enacted and intended to supplant all previous statutes relating to condemnation proceedings. The motion to reargue was denied with the Court finding that (a) even if the EDPL controlled in this case, EDPL§304(D) clearly provides that a deposit of advance payment sums must be made to the clerk of the court where&quot;... a conflict arises over the percentage of the condemnation award which should be paid to each of the several owners of interests in the condemned property...&quot;and (b) in any event the instant acquisition, as financed by federal highway appropriations, is governed by 42 USC§4601 et seq which at§4651(4) specifically provides for the deposit of advance funds&quot;... with the Court ...&quot;] 


 Camp Comfort Realty, LLC v. Assessor of the Village of Tuxedo Park, et al 
 Date of Decision: April 15, 2010
[Tax Certiorari]
[In this Orange County Article 7 case, petitioner&apos;s CPLR§3212 motion for summary judgement and respondents&apos; CPLR§3211 cross motion to dismiss the petition for failure to state a cause of action and for failure to comply with RPTL§708(3) were denied. With regard to the motion for summary judgement, although petitioner&apos;s evidence of the recent 2008 sale constituted substantial evidence to rebut the presumption of validity that attached to the assessment, petitioner failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the property was overvalued, raising a question of fact. With regard to respondents&apos; motion to dismiss for failure to comply with RTPL§708(3), untimely mailings made to the correct persons were not fatal to the petition where no prejudice was raised or apparent. Here, the lack of prejudice alone was found to constitute good cause shown for the late service. The decision distinguishes cases in which the required mailings are not made at all or are not made to the correct persons where such errors are fatal in the absence of good cause shown, which cannot be established by the lack of prejudice alone.] 


 

 Dominick D. Bologna and Bart A. Didden v. The Village of Port Chester 
 Date of Decision: April 2, 2010
[Condemnation]
[Post-trial EDPL Article 5 decision analyzes the highest and best use, valuation, and propriety of consequential damages resulting from the acquisition in eminent domain of several contiguous properties assembled for economic development by the claimants.The Court determined that an assemblage of properties had been engineered by the claimants in order to create a footprint capable of accommodating a large retail store such as a CVS drugstore, and rejected the opinion of the Village&apos;s appraiser that each of the properties should be valued individually on an&quot;as is&quot;basis. The decision also involves a complex analysis of the valuation of the properties by the Court which utilizes and intertwines the income capitalization and sales methodologies proposed by both assessors and modifies adjustments appropriately, and awards consequential damages for the diminution in value which occurred to certain of the lots by blocked rear exit capability resulting from the post-taking construction of a Walgreen&apos;s Pharmacy by the developer and the Village.] 

 TBS Realty Management LLC v. Village of Hillburn, et al 
 Date of Decision: December 22, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner&apos;s motion for summary judgement granted to the extent indicated in the decision based upon the uncontradicted proof that it participated in an arms length transaction in purchasing the subject premises as evidenced by the fact petitioner had no business dealings with the principals of the former owner prior to the sale, that they had not met prior to the closing of title, that all negotiations were conducted through a real estate broker, that both parties were represented by separate counsel, and that no unusual financing arrangements were involved.] 

 Michael H. Barnett v. The Town of Carmel, et al 
 Date of Decision: December 22, 2009 
 [Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner&apos;s motion for summary judgement alleging that the Town, rather than pursuing a Town-wide revaluation, has selectively reassessed the subject property by raising the assessment from $150,000 to $240,000 granted.
The Court found that petitioner proved that the property was improved in 2002 by the construction of a three car garage with second floor storage, heat and electricity,but no other utilities and no bath or kitchen, for which the assessment was raised from $105,000 to $150,000, and that the condition of the garage was unchanged in 2008.The respondent failed both to proffer an explanation for the increased assessment or a description of its own assessment methodology, and based the increase on the false and unsubstantiated premise that additional improvements to the garage(to wit: finishing it and rendering it residential) occurred after the 2002 reassessment.] 

 Village of Spring Valley v. N.B.W. Enterprises, LTD. 
 Date of Decision: November 23, 2009
[Condemnation]
[Post-trial EDPL§701 motion by claimant N.B.W for additional allowances for attorney&apos;s fees, appraisal fees (excluding invoice for the Appraisal Report, but to include fees incurred in connection with consultation and trial testimony), and disbursements necessary to achieve just and adequate compensation, where pre-taking offer by condemnor was $165,000 (with an actual value offered in proof by the Village at trial of $171,000) and the final award by Court was $325,000, exceeding the condemnor&apos;s offer and/or proof by a factor of over 90% -- MOTION GRANTED -- Claimant was awarded the amount of $91,352.39 with interest (although it may be noted that the Court declined to include, in the above award, interest on unpaid professional invoices, determining same to be unnecessary to achieve just and adequate compensation.] 


 Mavis Tire Supply Corp. v. Town of Ossining 
 Date of Decision: November 17, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Post trial decision in which the Court determined that substantial defects existed with regard to both parties&apos; appraisals. Although the Court approved of Petitioner&apos;s use of both the comparative sales and income capitalization methods, petitioner&apos;s methodology was found to be unclear both in his method of reporting average sales and in his computation of lease values. Respondent&apos;s decision to utilize only the comparative sales approach and its appraiser&apos;s determination to reject an income capitalization approach with regard to the subject (&quot;owner occupied&quot;) income producing property was rejected. The Court also found other deficiencies in respondent&apos;s appraisal such as numerous instances in which the appraiser under-reported the size (i.e. square footage) of comparable properties. As a result, the Court was required to make corrections and/or adjustments to both parties&apos; calculations in determining final indicated market values for the tax years at issue.] 


 Ray River Co., et al v. The Village of Haverstraw 
 Date of Decision: November 16, 2009
[Condemnation]
[Claimant&apos;s motion to compel condemnor to make an advance payment granted, despite previous rejection by claimant of condemnor&apos;s good faith offer of $1,190,000 for the acquisition, since the matter no longer appears to be on appeal as the Appellate Division has affirmed this Court&apos;s prior Decision and Order, and claimant&apos;s motion to reargue and/or renew to the Appellate Division has been denied; for the same reason, claimant&apos;s instant motion to renew and reargue is denied as moot.] 


 Cloverleaf Realty of New York, Inc., et al v. Town of Waywayanda 
 Date of Decision: September 30, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Respondent brought the instant motion to dismiss petitioners&apos; Article 78 action challenging special assessments by the Town for water and sewer improvements to their properties. Town Law 202 and 202 (b) govern the assessment method for financing municipal improvements and generally provide that special assessments be imposed on a benefit basis, or where such benefit basis is not designated, in the same manner as other Town charges, or as may be ordered by the Town Board [ 202 (3)]. By various resolutions the Town created new water and sewer districts and projected the cost per parcel for water and sewer, noting that residential properties were to be assessed based on size, and commercial parcels based on assessed value with additional charges based on metered usage. The resolutions each also ordered that the expenses of the sewer and water improvements&quot;...shall be assessed, levied, and collected...in just proportion to the amount of the benefit...&quot;determined by the Town Board to be conferred upon the properties. Since a benefit based assessment was intended and the current system is not benefit based, but a flat rate as to residential and ad valorem as to commercial properties, petitioners have stated a cognizable cause of action with respect to the respondent&apos;s failure to tax on a benefit based method.
Accordingly, respondent&apos;s motion to dismiss was denied.] 

 Affordable Housing Construction, LLC v Town of Monroe, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 25, 2009
[Tax Certiorari] 
 [Petitioner&apos;s Article 78 proceeding challenged changes in assessments to its multi-parcel residential development on a number of grounds including non-receipt of tax change notices (non-mailing acknowledged by the assessor), and for assessments to properties which were not completely improved with completed structures (contrary to assessor&apos;s policy of not taxing such incomplete improvements); petitioner&apos;s application to the County Real Property Tax Service Agency for relief on the grounds that the assessed value recorded on the property record card differed from that entered on the tax roll and thus constituted a&quot;clerical error&quot;was denied by the Agency Director without any referral of the Agency&apos;s report and recommendations to the tax levying body for the Town of Monroe -- Orange County -- for consideration and a determination on the application pursuant to RTPL§§556 (4) b and 556 (5) a-b-e.The Court on its own motion remanded the application to the Orange County Legislature for its consideration and determination. The respondents&apos; motions to dismiss were denied with leave to renew, and the matter was ordered to be held in abeyance pending such determination by the County Legislature.] 

 Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. v. The Town of Pleasant Valley, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 24, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Motion by intervenor school district to dismiss 2004-2008 petitions for improper service; when tax certiorari petitions were mailed to the Arlington Central School District, whether addressed to the superintendent (2006-2008 petitions) and initially forwarded to his office, or addressed to the School District (2004&amp;2005), the petitions were uniformly forwarded to the District’s Business Office for referral to counsel; therefore, based on its custom and practice, the District did not designate the superintendent of schools as the person to receive tax certiorari petitions, but, rather, designated its business office. Despite the district&apos;s policy and lack of prejudice herein, the 2004&amp;2005 petitions were dismissed for lack of a showing of good cause to excuse the improper service, but the Court noted, as it had in Wyeth Holdings, Inc., that even upon dismissal petitioner may seek leave to recommence the action pursuant to CPLR§205(a); service of the 2006-2008 petitions upon the Superintendent at the district office was excused based on this Court&apos;s holding in Bon Aire Condominium] 


 Wyeth Holdings Corporation v. The Town of Orangetown, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 22, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Motion by Nanuet Union Free School District and respondent Town of Orangetown for an Order dismissing the petitions for lack of service on the Superintendent of Schools for Nanuet denied; cross-motion by petitioner Wyeth seeking that such service be deemed proper nunc pro tunc pursuant to RTPL 708(3), or for permission to recommence the proceedings, without prejudice, pursuant to CPLR 205(a) granted in its entirety; here, industrial complex consists of ten parcels five of which were in the Pearl River School District and five in the Nanuet District; petitioner served only the Pearl River Superintendent after making a good faith effort (outlined in the decision) to determine the proper school district (of the four which served the Town); Court held that the well-meaning, but imperfect steps taken to notice the proper district constituted good cause which when coupled with the lack of prejudice to respondent excused the geographical error and improper notice; in so determining, Court rejected Nanuet&apos;s claim of prejudice based upon the severe financial implications of a possible adverse ruling.] 


 County of Orange v. Monroe Bakertown Road Realty, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 23, 2009
[Condemnation]
[Pretrial motions by all parties, seeking to strike each other&apos;s appraisals, held in abeyance, with leave to renew at time of trial; the Court adhered to its long practice, except in the most egregious circumstances, of deferring decisions on motions to strike appraisals to the conclusion of testimony at trial, reminding the parties that prior to hearing testimony from the experts retained by the parties, it is difficult for the Court to assess any proponent’s compliance, or lack of same, with Rule of Court (22 NYCRR 202.59) relating to the preparation of trial appraisals.] 

 Panorama Flight Service, Inc. v. Town/Village of Harrison, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 17, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner&apos;s motion for Summary Judgement challenging the revocation of its previously held exemption granted; respondent&apos;s cross-motion denied; respondent alleged that Panorama&apos;s facility at the Westchester County Airport did not provide services to the general public, and thus did not serve a public purpose, since only licensed pilots and light aircraft owners, constituting only a very few private individuals and corporations who could afford such services, utilized petitioner&apos;s facilities; Court disagreed finding that the Town (which had the burden of proof since it revoked the exemption) had failed to prove that the services (provided by petitioner) including flight training, aircraft rental, hanger storage, aircraft deicing, car rental, towing, and baggage handling were offered to the general public without any grant of exclusive rights, discrimination, or excessive fees, and had failed to prove that the persons and entities utilizing such services were not members of the general public who avail themselves of the services and facilities provided at the Airport and for whom such services are intended. Rather, the proof showed that such services comported to the terms of the Master Lease. The County’s intent, as stated in the Lease, is the offering by Panorama of airport services for the accommodation, convenience, and welfare of the public. In addition, the Lease outlined services that the Airport held out as available to the public in its promotional and informational materials.] 


 Copley Court Condominium v. The Town Of Ossining, et al 
 Date of Decision: September 10, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Motion by respondents for an Order dismissing 2002-2007 petitions for improper service on the Superintendent of Schools for the Ossining School District rather than upon the Briarcliff Manor Superintendent denied and petitioner&apos;s cross motion for leave to serve Briarcliff nunc pro tunc, granted; while the lack of prejudice alone has been held to be inadequate to supply the good cause required to excuse a lack of service (see e.g. Landesman v. Whitten), in this case, petitioner sought to properly serve the superintendent of the school district within which the subject parcel lay, but inadvertently served the superintendent of an adjacent school district; in the exercise of its discretion, the Court determined that the instant inadvertent geographical service error mirrored the facts in Harris Bay Yacht Club, Inc. v. Town of Queensbury, et al wherein the 3rd Department affirmed the lower court&apos;s finding that good cause existed to excuse the improper service and to allow leave to re-serve the petitions upon the proper school district.] 

 Jason and Donna Levitz v. The Assessor of the Town of New Castle 
 Date of Decision: September 10, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioners&apos; motion for summary judgement based on selective reassessment granted; in this case the subject residential property, although subdivided into two zoning lots (one containing a residence and the other only a tennis court) was assessed as a single tax lot at $393,000; at or about the time of the sale of the property to petitioners, the respondent assessor (pursuant to the request of the former owner submitted prior to the 2007 sale) converted the parcel into a two-tax-lot condition, reducing the assessment of the residential lot to $370,000, but raising the assessment of the tennis lot to $160,000 (based upon its now buildable status), thus increasing the total valuation of the properties well in excess of the assessment prior to the split, and occasioning the instant finding of selective reassessment in the valuing of the tennis parcel not for its current improvement, but for its building potential.] 


 Atlantis Group, LLC v. The Town of Blooming Grove Date of Decision: September 8, 2009 
 [Tax Certiorari]
[Motion by Town to dismiss petitions for failure to comply with discovery demand (for specified documents) which also contained language requiring a personal appearance by the owner or authorized agent before the BAR and a further advisement that if the owner or agent&quot;... shall willfully neglect or refuse to attend ... such owner ... shall not be entitled to any reduction of the assessment ...&quot;Thereafter, petitioner&apos;s counsel responded by delivering some of the requested material or an explanation of the lack of existence of information, accompanied with an offer to supply any additional information that the BAR might require. When neither the petitioner nor counsel appeared at the hearing (later asserted to be based upon law office failure) a letter was sent to petitioner denying any reduction&quot;... because of your willful neglect or refusal to attend this board&apos;s hearing ...&quot;The motion was denied. Although the BAR did explicitly find the non-appearance to be willful, the cause of such willful neglect or refusal was not disclosed in the Notice of Determination, nor was any evidence for the basis of such determination contained in the record other than petitioner&apos;s explanation for its non-appearance.] 


 Marianne Shoecraft, v. The Town of North Salem, et al : Date of Decision: August 10, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]

 Cong. Kolel Bnei Brak, Inc., v. Tax Assessor for The Village of Spring Valley, et al: 
 Date of Decision: July 24, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Motion by petitioner for Summary Judgement challenging the denials by respondent Village of renewal applications 
 for a religious exemption denied; the Court found that although it was conceded that petitioners received Section 8 
 subsidies, material issues of fact exist as to whether petitioner is profiting from the rental of the instant parcels and 
 regarding the true ownership and charitable use of the subject premises pursuant to Congregation Or Yosef and 
 Shimel decisions] 


 Leone Properties, LLC v. Town Of Cornwall, et al 
 Date of Decision: July 13,2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner and respondents each requested the Court to reconsider their previously denied motions for summary judgement based upon newly agreed stipulated facts; petitioners motion was granted and respondents&apos; was denied; the Court found that the Town&apos;s increased assessment changes to petitioner&apos;s property for the tax years in issue was selective since they were made without providing an explanation for the increases and failed to provide details of the methodology utilized by the assessor or that an appropriate comprehensive reassessment plan was in place for all similar properties in the Town] 



 St. Francis Hospital v. Kathleen Taber, Assessor, Town of Poughkeepsie, et al 
 Date of Decision: June 25,2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioner’s motion for summary judgement seeking a partial tax exemption (32% of the subject parcel) pursuant to RTPL§420-a granted.

 Ardsley Country Club v. Assessor of the Town of Greenburg, et al: May 18, 2009
[Tax Certiorari]
[This decision was occasioned by respondents&apos; motions for an order striking certain of petitioners&apos; notes of issue for failure to provide income and expense statements pursuant to 22 NYCRR 202.59 [b] and [d]1, which required such discovery to be provided in a timely manner to the municipalities in connection with the subject&quot;income-producing&quot;property. The issue in the case was whether the instant golf club was an&quot;income-producing property&quot;in accordance with the statute&apos;s requirements. The decision ultimately determined that the property was not income-producing and denied respondents&apos; motions, but nevertheless granted leave of the Court to compel production of the requested material by traditional discovery pursuant to CPLR Article 31 and§408.]

[Where neither party had filed a note of issue for the 2008 filing and Petitioner had not filed an income and expense statement for the year 2008, respondent&apos;s motion for an order granting consolidation for trial of the 2008 matter with the matters involving tax years 2003 through and including 2007 granted solely upon the condition that petitioner timely serve and file income and expense statements within 15 days of the instant ORDER and that a Note of Issue be filed at that time or immediately thereafter.] 

 Central Hudson Gas&amp;Electric Corporation v. Town of Newburgh, et al : December 23, 2008
[Post Trial Article 7 Tax Certiorari decision incorporates a detailed analysis of the valuation of a gas and electric utility company’s properties, including electric transmission lines and pipelines, transfer stations and substations, land values, transmission towers, wood poles, including consideration of the feasibility of“in house”construction by petitioner&apos;s employees vs. cost incurred by use of an outside contractor with overhead and profit. The decision also contrasts the different valuation and appraisal methodologies utilized by petitioner and respondents, including analysis of depreciation methodologies, functional obsolescence, and net salvage value, and gives a good summary of the law in this area.]

 David Weiner and Jennifer Phillips v. The Board of Assessors and/or the Assessor of the Town of Harrison et al : September 16, 2008
[Tax Certiorari]
[Petitioners&apos; motion for partial summary judgement granted solely on the issue of selective reassessment; respondents&apos; cross-motion for summary judgement denied. The Court determined that where original 3,600 square foot house was demolished and removed except for the foundation and portions of two of the original walls, both of which were utilized and expanded in the construction of a new 7,800 square foot home, the work done did not constitute new construction, but rather an improvement to an existing structure. Based on the lack of proof of the existence of a comprehensive municipality-wide reassessment plan, the Court ordered a new assessment, in which the equalized value of the improvements (to be determined by the assessor or at trial if necessary) is to be added to the prior assessment.] 

 In the Matter of the Application of Ferry Landing, LLC and Westchester Industries, Inc., et al 
 v. The Assessor of the Village Of Tarrytown and The Assessor of the Town of Greenburgh, et al : August 20, 2008
[Post-trial Tax Certiorari RTPL Article 7 decision analyzes the valuation of petitioners&apos; seven contiguous tax lots by the Town and Village, and generally rejects certain analysis of their appraisers for several reasons: (a) with the exception of two parcels, respondents&apos; appraisers, in order to transform seven separate tax lots on which numerous physical improvements and uses had been located during the years in issue into one large parcel of vacant land ready for development, inappropriately valued the remaining 5 parcels&quot;as though vacant and available for development to their highest and best use&quot;instead of on an&quot;as is&quot;basis, recognizing their current income producing condition and use; (b) in order to support their flawed methodology, respondents variously describe the use of the parcels and/or the income generated from parking as&quot;interim&quot;, or argue that the parcels are&quot;functionally vacant&quot;, or&quot;of little use&quot;, or contain buildings which are&quot;unused&quot;or&quot;generate no income&quot;, all of which are wholly, or partially factually inaccurate; (c) respondents placed undue emphasis on the fact that the zoning of the subject parcels was changed in 1998 to facilitate residential and other development contemplated by petitioners and that such zoning should be considered along with reasonable development potential in valuing petitioners&apos; underdeveloped land -- even if one were to accept that the parcels were entirely unimproved, despite the change in zoning, it has been conclusively established herein that initial approval for development of the subject parcels (i.e. acceptance of the Final Environmental Impact Statement) occurred only after the period in issue. Finally, the Court undertakes a detailed valuation of the properties utilizing variously the sales comparison and income capitalization methodologies, at times favoring a position of one party or the other (e.g. the Village&apos;s sales comparables or petitioner&apos;s calculation of the average market price increase), while undertaking a modification of aspects of both parties&apos; analysis, where appropriate, including to adjustments proffered by petitioner, and as to capitalization rates utilized by the parties. Based on the above, the Court ordered reductions in assessed value for each of the tax years by each of the municipalities and appropriate tax refunds, plus interest.] 

 In the Matter of the Application of BAJ, LP v. The Assessor of the Town of Goshen, et al : June 3, 2008
[Post-trial Tax Certiorari RTPL Article 7 decision analyzes the valuation of Petitioner&apos;s mixed residential/commercial parcel by the Town and rejects the analysis of its appraiser for several reasons: (a) Town&apos;s appraiser&apos;s inappropriate valuation of the property as if it had full approval for all tax years in issue (which was not the case) led to a per housing unit analysis of the residential portion by the Town rather than one based upon acreage, a flawed methodology, since absent final approval, any per unit calculation was speculative at best. As a result, the Court elected to apply adjustments ranging from -10% to -25% based upon the mixed state of approvals during the several years at issue; (b) the decision also rejected the Town&apos;s effort to compare two separate groups of properties to the subject, those that were residential only, and those that were commercial and/or industrial only, recognizing that the comparables should have reflected its current status as a mixed use parcel; (c) finally, the Town&apos;s failure to consider wetlands restrictions and buffer requirements which devalued the commercial portion of the subject parcel further flawed their analysis.] 

 State of New York (New York State Board of Real Property Services, et al) v. The Town Of Haverstraw : April 11, 2008
[Tax Certiorari Decision]
[Respondent&apos;s motion to dismiss petition, for failure to comply with discovery obligations before the Town BAR pursuant to RPTL§525 denied, the Court finding that respondent ORPS complied with respect to all information and documents except those relating to assessments outside the Town and wholly unrelated to the subject properties’assessments, which ORPS declined to provide on grounds of immateriality; that the non-Town information was in fact not material to the BAR proceeding as asserted by ORPS; that it was not improper for ORPS to object to questioning before the BAR by a consultant for the assessor; that the Town in any event waived any defect in this objection by consulting with counsel and apparently electing not to continue with questioning by the consultant; and that dismissal is not appropriate absent proof of willfulness on the part of ORPS, or of a specific finding by the Board of willful refusal by ORPS to comply with discovery obligations, both absent here]
