 Coming to America casts comedian Eddie Murphy as pampered African prince Akeem, who rebels against an arranged marriage and heads to America to find a new bride. Murphy&apos;s regal father ( James Earl Jones ) agrees to allow the prince 40 days to roam the U.S., sending the prince&apos;s faithful retainer Semmi ( Arsenio Hall ) along to make sure nothing untoward happens. To avoid fortune hunters, Prince Akeem conceals his true identity and gets a &quot;Joe job&quot; at a fast-food restaurant. Murphy and Hall play multiple roles, and there are innumerable celebrity cameos peppered throughout the proceedings -- including the Duke Brothers ( Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy ) from Trading Places .

 Editor&apos;s Note In this modern-day fairy tale, Eddie Murphy stars as a wealthy and pampered African prince who comes to America in search of a bride. His destination, of course, is Queens, New York. Accompanied by his closest companion (Arsenio Hall), the Prince quickly finds a job, new friends, new digs, new enemies, and more trouble than he ever imagined. COMING TO AMERICA is a hysterical fable with Murphy and Hall playing hilarious multiple roles with the help of astounding makeup effects.

 Coming to America - DVD Review By: Eric Meyerson filmcritic.com DVD Reviews Published on: 6/28/2007 8:23 PM In 1988, with his stock trading at an all-time high, Eddie Murphy outdid even himself with Coming to America. In the wake of a triptych of movies (The Golden Child, Beverly Hills Cop II, and the standup flick Eddie Murphy: Raw) hated by critics but consumed voraciously by his expanding audience, Murphy ditched the vulgar street-smart routine for African royalty and New York romance. And Coming to America became Murphy&apos;s biggest hit at the time in spite of pure, unadulterated wholesomeness. ... read the full review

 Plot Summary This fantastical fairy tale stars Eddie Murphy as Prince Akeem, a pampered African prince who is yearning to be self-sufficient in his extremely opulent society, where his every whim is catered to. When Akeem turns 21 he defies the wishes of his kingdom and refuses to marry the beautiful bride who has been chosen for him. Instead, he sets out for America to find true love with his trusty sidekick, Semmi (Arsenio Hall). Determined to appear common, the pair arrive in Queens, New York, and quickly have to adapt to a world where they are no longer royalty and can&apos;t seem to find a modern woman who suits the prince&apos;s tastes--until he meets Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley), the lovely daughter of Cleo McDowell (John Amos), who owns McDowell&apos;s restaurant, a fast-food restaurant suspiciously like McDonald&apos;s. Akeem and Semmi get jobs at McDowell&apos;s and set about charming the unsuspecting Lisa. As the romance blossoms, Akeem has an increasingly difficult time hiding his true identity, especially when his royal parents (James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair) and their entourage arrive in New York, eager to return their only heir to Africa. John Landis&apos;s comedy is an intelligent, funny movie that shows off the myriad talent of Murphy and Hall.

 Ultimate DVD 
 4 stars out of 5 -- &quot;Sharply scripted....It&apos;s still laughter-packed almost 20 years on, and Murphy and co-star Arsenio Hall are a hoot in multiple cameo roles.&quot; 08/01/2007 p.85 Crazy for Cinema 8 of 10 
 &quot;An enjoyable, though somewhat dated, prince out of water tale that shows Murphy doesn&apos;t have to be foul-mouthed to be funny. The precursor to his multi-character turns in The Nutty Professor , Murphy shows his softer side as the heir to an African throne looking for his true love in Queens, New York. Rather than settle on the perfect bride picked by his parents, Prince Hakeem wants a woman who will love him for who he is not for his future kingdom and bank account. With his trusted sidekick Semmi (Hall) in tow, they head to the Big Apple incognito to try to find the love of Hakeem&apos;s life...This being a comic fairy tale, all ends happily and wackily ever after. Though not a new idea, the plot ticks amusingly along thanks to the talented cast. Hakeem gives Murphy a chance to show his sweeter side and he&apos;s utterly charming, despite the limitations of his character. He&apos;s what makes this trifle worthwhile.&quot; DVD Talk 8 of 10 
 &quot; Coming to America is one of those perennial comedies that has been a staple of most people&apos;s lives thanks to home video and cable... Coming to America is an impressive comedic effort. One of the greats. It still inspires laughs after all this time, and it even manages to amaze from a technical standpoint. Given all the pieces Landis and his team have to work with--a romantic story, a stranger-in-a-strange-land story, parody, outrageous characters--the fact that it all fits together so well is quite an achievement. It could have been a real mess, but instead it&apos;s glorious fun...Eddie Murphy gives one of his most charming performances as Prince Akeem, but he also gets to cut it up as various other characters, thanks to awesome make-up by master special effects wizard Rick Baker. Always funny, Coming to America is one of those DVDs you&apos;ll watch again and again.&quot; - Jamie S. Rich The Washington Post 6 of 10 
 You won&apos;t believe it: Eddie Murphy, King of the Expletive, playing a good-natured, romantic lead and African king of the jungle...Confined to being a nice guy, a royal nice guy, he precludes himself from the kind of comedy his fans would expect. What you get instead is a light, slow-moving love story only scantly peppered with laughs...In Eddie Murphy Raw , the comedian&apos;s misogynic and remarkably unfunny concert movie, Murphy expressed a desire to meet a woman who knew nothing of his millions and who wouldn&apos;t take up the lifestyles of the rich and famous as soon as he married her. He figured only an African tribal woman would fit the bill...Well, here he acts out that fantasy, only in slightly altered form: Murphy is the African, and the Ideal Murphy Woman, he figures, is American. He&apos;s Prince Akeem, sole heir to the rich, fictional kingdom of Zamunda -- a soundstage Busch Gardens: The Dark Continent, where benevolent wild animals roam and where Prince Eddie, er, Akeem, basks in the extravagant attention of his slaves. They serenade him when he awakes, sponge him (all over) in the bath and strew petals in his path. But now that he&apos;s 21, it&apos;s time for an arranged bride, say his sovereign parents...This lightweight vehicle spends most of its time lugging exposition; and the main lugger is romantic lead Murphy, whose comic energies are thus wasted. Hall, former nutty-witty host of Fox Television&apos;s The Late Show , is not allowed to strut his stuff or play off Murphy. Most of the laughs are invested in the subsidiary (and broader) characters, some of them played by Murphy and Hall in disguise. The main pleasure in &quot;America&quot; comes in the romancing of prince and pauper. But the comedy is a mere handmaiden. - Desson Howe The Onion A.V. Club 8 of 10 
 In 1983&apos;s Trading Places , Eddie Murphy plays a pauper who becomes a prince of finance. In 1988&apos;s Coming To America , he plays a prince who masquerades as a pauper to find his ideal wife. Both films cleaned up at the box office during Murphy&apos;s Reagan-era heyday, and both let director John Landis channel Frank Capra. Trading Places taps into the farcical prankster side of Capra&apos;s persona--Landis describes it as his version of a &apos;30s-style &quot;social comedy&quot;--in its irreverent tale of a small-time con man (Murphy) who trades places with stuffy uber-WASP Dan Aykroyd at the whim of playfully perverse tycoon brothers Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche. America, meanwhile, shares Capra&apos;s fondness for moral comedies about pure-hearted innocents who&apos;d rather make their own way in the world than blindly follow tradition...Bellamy and Ameche reprise their battling-brothers characters for a goofy in-joke cameo in Coming To America , a disarmingly sweet fish-out-of-water comedy in which Murphy&apos;s good-natured African prince toils as a janitor at a fast-food restaurant in Queens while wooing the pretty daughter of owner John Amos. Murphy and sidekick Arsenio Hall--whose scene-stealing performance here seemed to promise a dazzling film career that never materialized--famously donned Rick Baker&apos;s makeup to play multiple characters, but unlike in Norbit, the effect is sweet and affectionate rather than grotesque and scatological. Murphy would soon exhaust the comic possibilities inherent in donning layers of latex to become a one-man lowbrow vaudeville extravaganza, but his shtick still felt fresh here, probably because there&apos;s an awful lot of heart hiding under all the prosthetics. - Nathan Rabin
