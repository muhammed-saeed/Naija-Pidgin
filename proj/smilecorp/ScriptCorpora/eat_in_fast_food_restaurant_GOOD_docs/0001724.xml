 Join Date: Oct 2005 Location: Bloomington Minnesota Posts: 2,033 Lost Drive-In Restaurants I did a search for Drive-Ins and Drive-Inns and came up with a couple threads for Drive-In Movie Theaters but none for Drive-In Restaurants, so, with the closing of 58 year old Porky&apos;s Drive In in St. Paul Mn. this past weekend, I thought there should be a thread for Lost Drive-In Restaurants only! No Theaters! It would be GREAT if pictures of these lost TREASURES could be posted, so those not old enough to remember them could get an idea of what they looked like.

This is for anyone and everyone, not just Minnesota. At one time Drive-In Restaurants were the place to be!

Picture this, it&apos;s 1955. Tom is the reining King of Forest Lake&apos;s Skateland. God&apos;s in his heaven, all&apos;s right with the world!

You and your steady girl have just exited the Rose Drive-In Theater. There are some cool sounds coming from your car&apos;s Motorola by a new kid from Memphis. You&apos;re cruising to find the Drive-In Restaurant that your buddies are hanging out at tonight. If this evening is going to proceed the way you want it to, you are at least going to find a nice California burger and cherry coke to feed your girl.

You passed the Roadside on your drive down Snelling but tonight your friends seem to be elsewhere. Maybe down by the fairgrounds at Sugar Dan&apos;s. As you take a left off Snelling and pass the place, you realize that you will have to search further.

OK...let&apos;s head over to St. Paul&apos;s east side. Maybe the Roller Rink has now let out and they will be somewhere on Arcade Street at Nelson&apos;s Drive-In.

A distinct sound of Porter Mufflers is coming up behind you. You proceed thru the yellow light knowing full well that by the next red light, he will be right along side of you in the other lane.

Is this going to be another night where your car and your driving ability are about to be &quot;tested&quot;? Maybe he&apos;ll just think he&apos;s not up to it and you and your girl can go on to meet your friends and do a bit of bragging anyway.

Come on &quot;old timers&quot;...SNAP OUT OF IT! It&apos;s 2011. Please help the rest of us revisit, in print, some of those wonderful memories of the great &quot;eating emporiums&quot; that were around the Twin Cities in the &apos;50s, &apos;60s, and &apos;70s where so many of us hung out. __________________

THE TWIN CITIES DRIVE INN SCENE, CIRCA 1960-1970

Back when gas was about 35 cents a gallon, we likely had a part time job at a grocery store making less then $1.00 per hour. After school, when we got real jobs, money was not quite so tight so filling the tank was not a hardship.

For me, in 1962, venturing out from Midway all the way to Porky&apos;s on the west side of Lake Calhoun in Mpls. made you think twice about your budget. With stops at all three Porky&apos;s locations (owned by the Truelson family then), even driving a stock 283 in my &apos;57 Chevy, one could go through $3.00 in gas. Add a cherry coke and maybe fries, cruising was cheaper if a few of you piled into one car.

I recall Porky&apos;s on University being the biggest attraction followed by the Three Bears also on University, just east of Lexington. The stretch between Porky&apos;s and Bridgeman&apos;s downtown to &quot;cruise the loop&quot; you would find yourself driving alongside &quot;Raggedy Ann&quot;, a &apos;57 Ragtop, &quot;Miss Mn&quot;, a turquoise &apos;55 Ford, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; and &quot;El Vega Baca&quot;, both red Chevy&apos;s if I recall. Remember, you had to have a name on your car either on the continental kit or more likely the front quarter panels to be truly cool.

Other stops included the Sun Drive-In on Central, Sandy&apos;s on Lexington and the Aloha near the old Holman field. My favorite was the Roadside across from the HarMar Mall as you had to use special coins to get out because they had so much traffic that they wanted paying customers. I found one of those coins not so long ago with a pinkrabbit&apos;s foot in a junk drawer. A real treasure!

Now for a fun story which is completely true. A fellow MSRA member, (whose name shall remain anonymous but drove a plum &apos;49 Merc.) on the Avenue had a favorite trick. Mr M would stop by the Three Bears, pour a can of &quot;carb out&quot; in the engine and by the time he got to the Drive-In, he would rev up the engine and nobody could see anything for several minutes. By the time, the manager was called, he was long gone.

Gary wrote the following about a picture that was included in his article that was way too small to post here;

This photo is of the crowd that virtually shut down University Avenue and the cops got so scared they left. Bleach burn outs were going on with room for only a one car width as you pulled into Porky&apos;s. You pulled out to your right, stopped, then did a burn out and the crowds just egged everyone on.

A couple friends were with me and we got a little nervous and left as it was totally out of control. MSRA got called to talk to the police after that. &quot;Back To The Fifties&quot; has tamed down since the early days.

Ah......The Roadside. That&apos;s where Ster and I went after our first date in 1957.

I remember when McDonalds built their first burger place in St. Paul and it was almost next door to the Roadside.

Teens had been going to the Roadside for years for their &quot;goodies&quot; like their lemon lime, but since a new place went up, we all had to &quot;try&quot; it out the first night it opened.

Next night.....right back to the Roadside and there we stayed! __________________

 Join Date: Jan 2009 Location: columbus, ohio Posts: 8,422 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants I was just thinking this week, Jim, about THE cool place in our little town of Logan, Ohio. It was called the Shake Shoppe and featured a sign depicting a guy and gal on 1890s period dress on a big-wheel bicycle. It was THE west terminus for all us cruisers, before we burned gas to go back the other way, trying to make noise -- and impressions -- all the way. Yeah, we had to keep an eagle eye for the cops.

As many times as my dad and mom took me there when I was little AND all the times I ran my various V-8s through there later , I NEVER once though to keep a napkin, a wax cup NOR take a photo showing the sign and similar logo! Now, I kick myself, the same as I mentioned in my Old Time Junkyard regrets on that thread. I suppose that I just thought that it should ALWAYS just, well, BE THERE! Forever.

It is now a Burger King.

When John Milner lamented in &quot;AG&quot; that, &quot;It used ta take an hour and a tank o&apos;gas&quot; to make the round trip from one end of town to the other, it was like an arrow in my heart.

Now, the Shake Shoppe is gone, and it&apos;s a chain fast-food restaurant. SAD thing is: The young kids don&apos;t know what it was like &quot;in the day.&quot; 

Milner knew, even if his comment was made in a &quot;movie.&quot;

 Join Date: Aug 2004 Location: Wa. Posts: 985 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants It is 7:00 in the evening, 1953 at the Olive Way Triple XXX in Seattle.
The roadsters and coupes start drifting in and parking back on the bank
where Nick the owner said we could hang out...A few hot street bikes show up also.
I am the envy of many because I am going steady with the best looking car hop
working there and that gets me free coffee.... Soon the cars started pairing up for
a friendly race at the various little used streets....Bikes are welcome also but they almost always win the street races....They don&apos;t fair so well against the cars at the drag strip though...
After the evening races, it is time for more grease burgers.
One of the biggest events of the evening is after the restaurant closes and all the cars
leave it is time for &quot;hot laps&quot;.....One car at a time to see who could can get around the building the fastest.
I quit doing that event when some guys started bringing out street legal track roadsters running alcohol....Eventually the Olive Way barrel closed and everyone moved either to the Rainier barrel or the Ballard barrel....it was never the same though.

Although everybody remembers Porky&apos;s east and Porky&apos;s west in Minneapolis, there was another drive-in located between the two... just off Lake Street on 28th and Grand Avenue. It was called the Chat &apos;n Nibble, but nobody seems to have a picture of it. I spent many days and nights there, but as jimi&apos;shemi291 says, &quot;I never once thought to... take a photo!&quot;

I do have a photo of the menu board that I got from a buddy who used to be one of their cooks in the 1960&apos;s. I&apos;ll post it later.

Also, two blocks up on Grand and Lake Street was Doyle&apos;s Chicken Shack. It wasn&apos;t a drive-in, but they had the best chicken in town... battered and deep-fried...buttered toast...dill pickle... and some of the best fries in the land. Every booth had a mini juke box selector that fed the main juke box on the floor.

If you were low on funds, you could get a whole tray of fries for 25 cents and you could sit by the window and watch the cars cruise Lake Street. Last edited by 51wagon; 04-05-2011 at 07:56 PM .

 Join Date: Feb 2007 Location: Texas Posts: 10,532 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants Here in Pasadena TEXAS there was Traynor&apos;s, The Corral, Vickie&apos;s in nearby South Houston, and across the Houston area were many Prince&apos;s and Ritzee drive-ins. All but the Prince&apos;s are gone.

The first and last Prince&apos;s Drive-In was in the middle of downtown Houston and closed quite a few years ago. Several Prince&apos;s have been built over the last years since but none are drive-ins.

C&amp;D Burgers is still in business but eat in not drive in any more. Broiler Burger still has a couple of locations...eat in only I think. There are others as well in the Houston area and smaller towns around that survive. Last edited by pasadenahotrod; 09-15-2011 at 02:39 PM .

 28th and Grand...I live just a few blocks from there and drive past that corner every day on my way home from work. There are 1960s era apartment buildings on the NE and SW corners, an older duplex on the NW corner that&apos;s been there forever, and on the SE corner is a small neighborhood market that&apos;s pretty old as well. Was the drivein on one of the corners now occupied by apartments? You can call it up in Google Street View and look around.

In answer to your question, the Chat &apos;n Nibble was located on the NE corner of 28th and Grand... Rosen&apos;s Grocery was on the SE corner...large house on the SW corner and the Duplex that you mention sat on the NW corner.

On Pleasant Avenue, directly east of the Chat, was Havir&apos;s DX gas station.

I have attached a photo of the menu board from the Chat. It is the only picture that I have ever found of the Chat &apos;n Nibble. (Thanks Jerry.) The car hops in the photo are facing Grand Avenue. Attached Thumbnails

 Join Date: Nov 2010 Location: somewhere Posts: 1,972 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants Here in CT We have Harry&apos;s Place near the town green in Colchester, CT. Its celebrating 91 years this year!!! It&apos;s not lost, and it hasn&apos;t been bulldozed yet but i figured it was well worth sharing. It&apos;s a little white shack that has been painted over and over again with the original lettering painted over and over again. It truly is the BEST burger you have ever had.

Their burgers are small but juicy topped with fresh tomatos, lettuce, onion, etc. Their burger buns are homemade at the local vintage colchester bakery just up the street. Fries are awsome and they even serve ice cream and hot dogs, etc. They have a big menu but you really cant go there and not have a burger....or two. They close for the winter but they recently just opened. there is a line no matter what time of day it is, if its frezing, pouring, or sweltering hot.

Back before there was highways Harry&apos;s was on the main route to get to the shoreline. Back in the day, the CT shoreline was the place to be for family vacations, etc. People coming and going from the shore still pass by and stop to eat here.

My grandmother used to tell us stories every time we went to eat there. she used to explain how her and bunch of friends use to jump in her convertible and they would all take car loads and go to harry&apos;s for a night out.

I live about 40 minutes away and we still managed to get there maybe once a week if we&apos;re really tempted.

Harry&apos;s just secures the fact that CT is the capitol for the best cheeseburgers

It has had one name change since the &apos;40s, my dad used to eat there when he worked for an old AM radio station outside of town (KTKC). It is now in the middle of town.

 

The old radio staion was another neat building, art deco with plenty of glass brick, they recently &quot;re-modeled&quot; it. Just an ugly box now. __________________

 About what year did it close? I grew up around 27th and Fremont and vaguely remember a drive in there. And don&apos;t forget after hours the White Castle on Lake street was always open.

here it was:

and there it goes:

Uncle Ken&apos;s was a former Tastee Freez opened in the 50&apos;s.

 http://www.agilitynut.com/eateries/tastee.html 

I&apos;m not sure why they demolished it. I don&apos;t remember it being there so it must&apos;ve been demolished several years ago now. The lot is sitting emty and the only thing left is the pad it once sat on. Extremely frustrating...why didnt they just sell it to someone who would take care of it and open it? I have no clue what happened to the sign but it looks like it was saved (from the demo photos) .... and then probably re-sold.


That lot is just itching for another cool drive-in! Last edited by farmergal; 04-06-2011 at 08:44 AM .

 Join Date: Jul 2002 Location: Abilene Kansas Posts: 3,331 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants My mom used to work at Hallmark Ice Cream in the 60s when it was on Boston Post Road in Old Lyme Conn.

It moved in the early &apos;70s a few miles away, but closer to the beach. Great ice cream and burgers.

 


Another great ice cream place is Salem Valley Farms at the end of rt 11.

 

I used to work at the UConn creamery when I went to ag school there.

 


And I love Frostee Freez in Middletown Rhode Island too.

 

And you have to go to Grey&apos;s down in Tiverton RI.

 

I guess these aren&apos;t &quot;lost&quot;, but maybe not discovered yet by some people. All great reasons to get out and drive the old car or hotrod or custom though.

 Join Date: Nov 2008 Location: phoenix, az Posts: 5,940 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants I hate to go all the way back to the first couple of posts and not quote, but they were pretty long and would take up a bunch of space. At the relatively young age of 46 I remember The Roadside and the Rose drive in theater that was mentioned in the second post. My family home as a kid was at Fairview and county rd. C. Dad was a hot rodder, and the first place either dad&apos;s or mom&apos;s T-Buckets went when the snow melted was The Roadside! And I have to admit that later, when my mom remarried, a memoralbe evening was spent at the Rose where our newly united &quot;Brady bunch&quot; type family watched &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; from two cars... Station wagon full of kids at one end, parents in another! __________________

 The Dari-Ette Drive-in started out as an ice cream stand in 1951. They later added drive-in parking, speaker boxes and a small indoor dining area to the original structure. The Dari-Ette still has car hops. It also offers many Italian items and is famous for its spaghetti sauce. Attached Thumbnails     __________________

 http://www.rhs1962.com/drive-ins.htm 

 The popular Airloha, owned and operated by the Elman Lemley family featured the famous &quot;Stratoburger&quot;, which was a burger with two patties with melted cheese in between, two strips of bacon and lettuce and tomato, a first!

I&apos;m not sure when the Chat &apos;n Nibble closed, but I would guess in the mid to late 60&apos;s. Prior to becoming the Chat, I think it was a Twin Kiss drive-in and then a Polar Twin drive-in. Both places specialized in twisted ribbons of chocolate and vanilla ice cream in the same cone.

I do remember White Castle on Lake Street ... both of them. The Vogue and the American theaters were just down the street from the one on West Lake.

Juan Delgadillo was the owner at the time and he made us all feel as though we were in some kind of circus side show with the antics he pulled. We stayed an extra hour just to watch him tease his customers. His show stopper was &quot; Do you want mustard on your hot dog?&quot; And when you said yes he&apos;d point the mustard bottle at you and squeeze. Out came a long yellow string that looked like mustard and everyone in line would jump back about 5 feet. Great fun. A true Route 66 Drive In.

I remember they had &quot;mashed potato&quot; french fries!! We moved to Texas when I was in 1st grade, and now when i go back (im 36), I still see the old building, but the original is long gone...I still remember the sign tho!! My favorite spot was the 2nd st. &quot;Footer&quot; stand...it&apos;s still there and when i visit, i eat there almost everyday!!

It was THE west terminus for all us cruisers, before we burned gas to go back the other way, trying to make noise -- and impressions -- all the way. Yeah, we had to keep an eagle eye for the cops.

As many times as my dad and mom took me there when I was little AND all the times I ran my various V-8s through there later , I NEVER once though to keep a napkin, a wax cup NOR take a photo showing the sign and similar logo! Now, I kick myself, the same as I mentioned in my Old Time Junkyard regrets on that thread. I suppose that I just thought that it should ALWAYS just, well, BE THERE! Forever.

It is now a Burger King.

When John Milner lamented in &quot;AG&quot; that, &quot;It used ta take an hour and a tank o&apos;gas&quot; to make the round trip from one end of town to the other, it was like an arrow in my heart.

Now, the Shake Shoppe is gone, and it&apos;s a chain fast-food restaurant. SAD thing is: The young kids don&apos;t know what it was like &quot;in the day.&quot; 

Milner knew, even if his comment was made in a &quot;movie.&quot;

 Join Date: Apr 2007 Location: UT Posts: 30 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants Here in UT we have a couple that are still around. Hires has 3 locations in the SLC area. The downtown and Sandy locations still have car hops. The owner actually passed away a few months ago. He was in his late 80&apos;s if I remember correctly. He worked every day until the last couple of years. His son now owns and runs Hires.

Back in the 60&apos;s my Dad owned the Frostop in Boise ID on State St. It was the big hang out back then. He had carhops and root beer served in frosted mugs. Anyone that could chug 1 qt of root beer and did not throw it back up, got it for free. What most people did not realize is that he had plenty of carbonation in the root beer. One day one of my dads friends came in and ordered a double cheeseburger. As a joke my dad put everything on it except the meat. The guy ate the burger and never said a word or mentioned there was not meat on it. My dad laughed over that for many years.

I wish I had pics of the old place. __________________

 6244 Cedar Avenue, Richfield, Minnesota; courtesy of Roosevelt High School Class of 1963.
 
 Note the sign for &quot;Pizza Pie&quot;. It would be fun to be able to read the menu prices on the structure at the right, wouldn&apos;t it? I believe Qwest Communications is located on or near this property today. 

 &quot;I worked at the Tom Tom Drive-In at the corner of Hiawatha and Minnehaha Avenues South at 53rd Street. They had car hops. It was owned by Herb DeRoma, and in 1960 he started the first broasted chicken eat-in and home delivery just off 66th and Lyndale Avenue South. I moved with him to this establishment called the Chicken Farm, located next to Peck Brothers Sporting Goods. I worked for DeRoma in 1959 and 1960.&quot; ~ F. David Shrewsbury, RHS, &apos;61 ~

Picture is said to be 1956.

 I remember that place, the DQ anyway, not the gas station. I lived near Vancouver in the late 70&apos;s. Cruising was so big then that it would take you half the night to make the circuit. Got so bad they blocked off the entrance to the DQ on Friday and Saturday nights to try and curb it. Guess it worked. __________________

 Sadly the old Vancouver Burgerville will be gone in October. They&apos;ve sold the property to a developer planning a &quot;mixed use structure&quot;. Burgerville has stated the old restaurant doesn&apos;t fit in with their more modern locations... __________________

 Here is another Drive-In called Kermit&apos;s Hotdog House and is also located in Winston Salem NC. 
 About one block west of the restored shell shaped yellow Gas Station the was built by Shell Oil in the 1930&apos;s and operated by Quality Oil of Winston Salem NC, now it is a Historic site that also provides a cool photo background for Classic Autos.

 Hey there in Afghanistan, Matt! Dude, I imagine most evenings over where you are, it would be GREAT to have a place like the ol&apos; Shake Shoppe in Logan, Ohio, to drop by. Family-owned but way cool. Food, fountain drinks, sundaes, splits, great company, gals to scope, the occasional loud pipes and the peel-out. It was one super spot. Now we mostly -- you, too? -- make out with chain fast-food places. Not the same feel, at all. 

 Anyway, man, I hope you and your buddies -- guys and gals in the services -- know that the patriots back home salute you for doing your uncomfortable, dangerous jobs! God bless you AND the USA!

I have memories of the Roadside from my childhood.
I was born in &apos;61, and with my Sister being 14 years older, I remember tagging along with her and her boyfriend at the time to the Roadside when she was left in charge of me.
I&apos;m sure I was a real buzz kill.

Very good food and I guess they have a yearly event for cars to show. Here in the Milwaukee area, a few drive ins exist, most notably Leon&apos;s. Still sporting the huge neon signage and stainless steel sides. As someone mentioned before, Gus&apos; in East Troy which still brings in many cars. There used to be Karen&apos;s on the north side of Milwaukee where I got my first DJ gig doing a cruise night but that got torn down to make way for a Walgreen&apos;s. Georgie Porgies in South Milwaukee has been around since the 70s but has an amazing Saturday cruise night and tasty yummies. As far as chain cruise nights go , the Solid Gold Mc Donald&apos;s is being torn down and replaced with the more upscale modern look McDs is going for. Solid Gold had great memorabilia for Rock and Roll and cars.

 Fantastic photo from 1945, posted on flick r by &quot;Army.Arch,&quot; shows carhop 
 Betty Whittington serving customers at Price&apos;s Drive-In, Houston, Texas. 
 Photo was apparently taken by a U.S. Army Signal Corps member and is 
 in the U.S. National Archives and, thus, in the public domain. That all 
 said, THANK YOU ArmryArch and flickr! Started in 1934, Prince&apos;s even 
 made the cover of LIFE magazine! By &apos;41, carhops were dressed in showy 
 majorette uniforms, and Jeanette Hall was named &quot;Miss American Carhop,&quot; 
 landing herself a magazine cover. Yow. For a good read, go to Prince&apos;s 
 website and browse! www.princeshamburgers.com/ The customer and 
 employee MEMORIES are great! Once, at least, the drive-in was truly 
 part of the culture and people&apos;s lives! Damn! I love the HAMB!

 Join Date: Jan 2009 Location: columbus, ohio Posts: 8,422 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants If anybody&apos;s wondering when and where the roots of the drive-in 
 restaurant were planted, here are some clues at least! After a tad 
 of digging, I found out what LIFE issue carhop Jeanette Hall was 
 featured on: Feb. 26, 1940. Yeah, THAT early ! And way before the 
 roller-skates became the drive-in stereotype, Prince&apos;s in Houston 
 dressed their carhops in majorette outfits. Life obviously spotted 
 a trend, or at least the latest fad! LOL. Jeanette would be close to 
 80 today. Let&apos;s hope she&apos;s well, a grandma AND in the pink of health! 

 

 This and many other LIFE issues are available on eBay, folks! Old mags are a great 
 way to jump into that time machine HAMBers are always wishing for!

 Opened in 1925, GoodyGoody in Tampa Bay, FLA, was one of America&apos;s first true drive-in 
 restaurants, meaning you were served in your car. Not a roller skate nor a majorette in sight 
 -- as a matter of fact, the &apos;hops were young guys, not gals! This VINTAGE pic is from a keen 
 article by Michael Murillo for Tampa&apos;s Cigar City magazine. THANKS, Michael! Well worth

in Minneapolis

This was in the late &apos;40s as he would also talk about his friends (Dick Bakken?) brand new and customized Studebaker Starlight Coupe. I&apos;m thinking the Stude was a &apos;48.

Funny Story; One night the food was so bad that Dad swore he was going to kill the cook. The cook is my mother. They didn&apos;t know each other when he said that. They were married for 55 years and my mom was a very good cook. __________________

I do have some pictures of cruise nights but not of the signs or buildings, however I also have video tapes of every thing.
I&apos;ll have to dig around other cd&apos;s to see if I have other pictures that I can post.
P.S. The picture of the &apos;53 Chevy was not taken at the A&amp;W but it was taken in Reno. Attached Thumbnails     __________________

I doubt the chain is still there, but between P3 and Leons in Milwaukee, we&apos;re talking a lot of good time spent. Centurion9

Thanks for the pics guys!
I don&apos;t have a pic to post but the first drive in I remember as a kid was the BUSY BEE located in Guthrie, Ok. at corner of Division (Highway 77) and Noble (Highway 33). A small frame building with one of those &quot;Coke&quot; signs on the sides. You could go inside or have curb service with one of those metal trays hung off you car window. Burgers at 5 cents! Some one had to explain to me what a &quot;greasy spoon&quot; was!
It&apos;s long gone now.
I&apos;ve been looking for a picture of the BUSY BEE for over thirty years but never found one yet.
Any one remember this place???? __________________

 If you contact the town Saugus in Mass they usually have historical photos documented in their files of many prominant landmarks throughout the years. They might be able to help you with additional photos. There was also an additional Adventure Car Hop in Nattick, Mass which was renamed to Galaxy Car Hop. I think one of them was also re-named to Lasso&apos;s __________________

 Join Date: Nov 2010 Location: somewhere Posts: 1,972 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants if you&apos;re ever in the area of Mendon, Mass (CT border but in the northeast corner) there is George&apos;s Surf and Turf Drive-In. It&apos;s a good trip back in time and they have delicious food.

There is also Chelle&apos;s 50&apos;s car-hop in Stafford, CT. It&apos;s not vintage but its very much nostaglia and the food is excellent...especially if your looking for breakfast on a sunday morning.

Other places in Mass (i do not believe they are still around) are:

Art Johnsons. It was famous for the hot rod races that would occur out in front at the street lights. The hot rodders of the area loved that drive-in for that very reason. It was known for retaining its 50&apos;s nostalgic feel and was located in Norwood, Mass. It closed in the 70&apos;s and was THE PLACE if you were a hotrodder

Jolly Cholly&apos;s: Which was located on Route 1 (same route as The Adventure) but in Attleboro, Mass. It had special parking for the &quot;nice&quot; cars back in the day and was known as the place to go on a Saturday night. They also had amusements.

The Adventure Car-Hop located in Saugus off Route 1 was probably the most famous in Mass. Anyone in the area growing up in the late 50&apos;s, early sixties could probably remember listening to Woo Woo Ginsberg WMEX AM Radio there. Arnie Ginsberg could be heard there from 7pm until 10pm from &apos;58 to &apos;65. The Adventure was also known for its signature &quot;jingle&quot; on the airwaves!

Rocky Point: wasn&apos;t a drive in but an Amusement Park. It has now long been abandoned with many of the buildings destroyed. it was located in Warwick, Rhode Island and was opened in the 1800&apos;s. It closed in 1995 and retained a lot of its retro/vintage charm.

Lincoln Park: located in Dartmouth, Mass was open year round for dancing, skating, bowling

Ratteys: Was located in North Attleboro, Mass. It was also located on Route 1; right up the road from Jolly Chollys.


Eddies Diner: Located on route 1 in Walpole Mass. If you went after midnight you had to be prepared to wait in long lines. Famous for the cruising route along route 1 that included Eddies, Red Wing Resturaunt, Art Johnson&apos;s and Norwood Arena

Del&apos;s Lemonade: Known as a major icon in Rhode Island. Got its name in 1948 and was the only product sold at a small stand in Cranston, RI.

Earl&apos;s: was in Rochester NH and was a famous drive in in &apos;57.

Martin&apos;s: is what Earl&apos;s eventually became and its still there! __________________

Mattapoisett, Mass had the Woodie Drive-in.

The Texan Car-Hop was also located on Route 1 in Saugus just north of the Kiddie Ranch

I believe there is a Fitzy&apos;s Car Hop on Park Avenue in Worcester, Mass.

also, the Flying Saucer Car Hop was in Worcester, Mass


Speedy&apos;s was also in Worcester, Mass. i believe they have car hop reunions in celebration every year. __________________

 yea. there really isn&apos;t any car hops around. you&apos;re more likely to focus on the drive-in resturaunt or vintage/retro eatery in this area. if you ever head down to Colchester, C T area..be sure to stop in at Harry&apos;s Place. Been there over 90 years and it is the kind of burgers in the country...hands down __________________

 Join Date: Apr 2011 Location: USA Posts: 14 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants I realize Sonic Drive-in is not lost, but it is the greatest drive-in and it is still going strong.


 SONIC Drive-In 
 
 Year Opened: 1953
 First Location: Shawnee, OK
 Bite of History: After a stint as a milkman, Troy Smith opened a small root beer stand named Top Hat Drive-In. The little stand was very profitable, and Smith decided to expand the offerings and install a carhop system, where drivers received individual service without having to leave their car. The concept proved successful and in 1956, Smith partnered with Charles Pappe to open a second location in nearby Woodward. Unfortunately, in 1959 Smith was forced to change the name due to trademark issues. Top Hat was renamed SONIC Drive-In, as its motto was &quot;service at the speed of sound.&quot; Today, the franchise is one of the few drive-ins to offer the carhop system, and some even showcase roller-skating servers!

 Join Date: Apr 2011 Location: USA Posts: 14 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants Dallas business man Jesse G. Kirby, and his financial backer Dr. Reuben W. Jackson invented the entire concept in 1921 with the opening of their first Pig Stand on Chalk Hill Road near the Dallas Fort Worth Turnpike. It wasn’t really much to see, just a board-and-batten stand at the back of a corner lot.

This little stand was destined to change the U.S. food business, and some people claim that The Pig Stand virtually invented the entire fast food business. Up until that time there were other quick dining establishments including that other unique American invention the diner. What made the Pig Stand different were their new“curb service,”and the all male“car hops.”

Curb service was exactly what it sounds like, the car parked at the curb (because there was no off street parking lot) and your food was delivered hot and fresh to the curb. The term car hop was coined because the servers would literally hop on the running board of the moving car before it came to a stop. In the beginning they only worked for tips, so competition for customers was fierce. All of the car hops wore white caps, white shirt, and bow ties. This is a far cry from the sometimes surly drive-through window order takers of today.

Sadly, the Pig Stands legacy came to an abrupt end on November 15, 2006 in a dispute with the state of Texas over unpaid sales tax. One of the original locations in San Antonio remains open and is now known as“Mary Ann’s Pig Stand.”Every Friday night it is home to an appreciative crowd of old school cruiser and hot-rodders. A few additional locations remain in Oklahoma as“Van’s Pig Stands.” Attached Thumbnails

 Max , two great posts there, man. The Pig Stand sounds very much like Prince&apos;s, covered on Post #74. Now THAT is some TRAD food service. And you are right about the impersonal to downright surly service you can (I&apos;ll say SOME times, to be fair!) get nowadays -- forget about somebody coming and serving you in your car! 

 But that is why Jim started the thread. AND, I&apos;m glad to hear LawBreaker &apos;s positive attitude about being grateful to have a &quot;retro&quot; drive-in in his town. At least it&apos;s in the right spirit and approaches recapturing a tad of the EXPERIENCE of the &quot;car-hop&quot; food stands that were once EVERYWHERE! As for rods&amp;customs at your local eatery? I say, you BUILD it, and they will (eventually) come!

 Truman&apos;s in L.A., posted by HAMBer LowCat on the &quot;Vintage shots from days gone by&quot; 
 thread. He said it was shot in 1959. This is such a nicely lit shot of a traditional drive-in 
 restaurant that it just belongs on this thread. Anybody know if Truman&apos;s is still there??? 
 If so, what&apos;s the address, or nearest intersection?

In the early sixties it was the mecca of drive in&apos;s and for setting up street races on Crossbay Blvd and the infamous Connecting Highway. We also frequented Schorrs Drive In on Sunrise Hwy in Rockville Center and street raced on the Jones Beach Causway. Where i now live in Kentucky the closest thing to a drive in is Sonic which is not frequented by rodders. It would be heaven to cruise to a place like Mels in AG. Too bad those days are gone forever.

Posts: 4,125 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants This is the famous Wayne&apos;s Drive-In, located on the corner of Bluff St and US Hwy 50 South, in Delta, Colorado. This picture was taken sometime around 2005 or so, and I borrowed it off Bing somewhere. Mom and Dad started this restaurant in 1973, which was then the Kris-Klar Drive-In, and located one block South of the current location on US 50 S. The Kris-Klar was inside a converted mobile home, and IT was started in 1958. Dad promptly changed the name to Wayne&apos;s after he bought the Kris-Klar. The drive-in moved to the pictured site in 1975. Lots of high-school girls were carhops at Wayne&apos;s! During the time my parents owned the restaurant, the entire lot was gravel. It was concreted sometime in the late &apos;90s. Mom and Dad had the restaurant, and the concession stand at the race track, until late 1978, when the business was sold. Over the course of the five years or so that my folks owned Wayne&apos;s, nearly my whole immediate family had worked there, at one time or another. The menu was kept simple - burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries, rings, coffee, pop, shakes, malts, and soft serve ice cream. And occasionally, fresh donuts!

Wayne&apos;s was famous for the Wayne&apos;s Special Burger, which is a burger that was SO good, the subsequent owners could never really duplicate it. The only burger anywhere on Earth that I know even comes close to that these days is an In-N-Out Burger, which you CA/NV/AZ folks know so well!

We had our share of interesting people come in to the drive-in! One Saturday in 1974, a man was walking up to the patio area, where we also had a walk-up window to order at. He didn&apos;t really look like he knew where he was going, and we were very busy at that moment. Dad looks out the closed window and says back to us &quot;Anyone helping that old SOB outside?&quot; I opened the window and said &quot;May I help you, sir?&quot; He gives me his order for a Special, and Dad starts cooking it up. I recognized the man immediately, but said nothing about it. Mom takes the order to him and asks &quot;Aren&apos;t you the mayor or governor or something like that?&quot;, to which I starting laughing out loud. He replies &quot;Yes, ma&apos;am, I&apos;m Governor Vanderhoof!&quot;, to which Dad started laughing hard, too. &quot;Anyone helping that old SOB outside?&quot;

Wayne&apos;s went out of business shortly after the property owner died in 2009. It sat empty for nearly a year. Now, it is a completely different business with a new name and owner. The concession stand was so well-built, it far outlasted the racetrack. It is still on the former racetrack property, used as a storage shed, much closer to the highway! It&apos;s cool to know that Wayne&apos;s Drive In is a well-remembered Delta icon by a lot of folks out there! Like the Tastee Freeze, Callaway&apos;s Coffee Pot, and the Dairy King, all are now part of Delta&apos;s storied history pages. Attached Thumbnails   __________________

It has had one name change since the &apos;40s, my dad used to eat there when he worked for an old AM radio station outside of town (KTKC). It is now in the middle of town.

 

The old radio staion was another neat building, art deco with plenty of glass brick, they recently &quot;re-modeled&quot; it. Just an ugly box now. 
 I miss this place. Ate there many times in the past. My dad told stories about hanging out there in 56, 57, 58. He went to College of Sequoias across the street. It would be a shame if they changed the look!

 G-Man, too bad the BIG BOW WOW drive-in is out of business. From the ton of stuff on the &apos;net, sounds like it was &quot;American Grafitti&quot; X10 -- AND on the East Coast! The pix I saw of Cross Bay Blvd. show it STRAIGHT-AS-AN-ARROW! 

 HOW COULD SUCH A POPULAR SPOT GET CLOSED DOWN???

 Well, here&apos;s another &quot;interior&quot; shot at a spot popular with teens. The juke- 
 box (which would have played 78-rpm platters! ) is a joy to behold! And I 
 NEVER knew saddle shoes were popular as early as 1940! (Maybe I should 
 have paid closer attention to more Andy Hardy movies? LOL! ) Man, we 
 HAVE to give a vote of THANKS to LIFE magazine for capturing &quot;candid&quot; 
 shots of every-day life in the Free World, especially in the days before we 
 had to defend our way of life against the totalitarian regimes of the &quot;Axis 
 Powers&quot;! (Photo THANKS to LIFE magazine, Jan. 1, 1940. Photo by William C. Shrout for Time/LIFE.)

Back and forth all nite. Scotties was later an Arby&apos;s, but is now closed and lookin pretty bad.

VOETOM (post #69).

We were in the area today so I stopped to take a couple of pictures. Oh the nights spent cruising through there. Also remember the night Car Craft came to town, not a spot to be had.

Best,

 Apparently from right before or after WWII. The faces in photos often tell a story! 
 This also shows, again, that &quot;carhops&quot; weren&apos;t always gals. The glasses were real 
 glass, the food wraps were biode gradable paper, and your condiments didn&apos;t come 
 in those annoying little plastic packets!

 And for anybody interested in some interesting HISTORY about the Big Boys 
 and &apos;40s and &apos;50s drive-in ARCHITECTURE , this Wiki article is a good start! 

 Bob&apos;s Big Boy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
 Bob&apos;s Big Boy is a restaurant chain started in Southern California by Bob
Wian. It is now part of Big Boy, an owner of several chain restaurants. ...

 Join Date: Jan 2009 Location: columbus, ohio Posts: 8,422 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants From Big Boy&apos;s own site, a cool piece of history! I didn&apos;t know this background, so maybe other HAMBers will find it edifying, too. 

 In 1936, Bob Wian sold his prized DeSoto Roadster to buy a small hamburger stand in Glendale, California. He named it Bob&apos;s Pantry. 

 One night in 1937, a regular customer requested something different for a change. Bob went to work and the first double-decker hamburger was born. Customers couldn&apos;t get enough of Bob&apos;s new creation. 

 One fan in particular was a chubby six-year-old boy in droopy overalls. He would often help Bob sweep up in exchange for a free burger. In honor of his young friend, Wian decided to name the better burger the Big Boy. Another regular customer, a movie studio animator, sketched the now famous character on a napkin. 

 The rest is history.

Here is a behind-the-scenes shot that night. This gentlemen was the owner of one of the neighboring institutions and he &quot;emphatically&quot; was telling Neil from CarCraft to &quot;empty his lot&quot;. Neal reminded him he was from CA and it was the KC people filling his lot. Neil later said the gy was packing heat...

I have a lot of under-the-counter and behind-the-scenes treasures from that wild weekend in May 1980.

 Posted by RoadKill on another thread, this outstanding drive-in photo was 
 shot by photog Bob Miller in 1960 at Don&apos;s Bar-B-Q Chuck Wagon, 4902 
 Aurora Ave. (near Greenlake), Seattle, in 1960. Cowboy cutouts highlighted 
 the Western motif, and waitresses served Western-style grub on aluminum 
 trays hung on one&apos;s car window. The photo was apparently shot for some 
 sort of promotional use, as the women are wearing ribbon sprays with the 
 slogan, &quot;Keep Washington Green, Bring Money&quot;! Bob apparently donated 
 all of his collected work, as the pic is part of the Robert H. Miller Collection 
 i n Washington&apos;s Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) Photograph Col- 
 lection. And the museum offers quality prints for display, though I get the 
 impression you&apos;d need to talk with them, if you&apos;d want to publish the pic in 
 a for-profit production.

If you&apos;re between Youngstown and Pittsburgh it&apos;s a cool place. Not the original building but original location since 1947. The food ain&apos;t bad - and it&apos;s a hot place on a summer Saturday night.

This is our Harvey&apos;s,Johnie&apos;s and now Bob&apos;s Big Boy Broiler in pix.
As Bad Bob stated above we did lose our Drive-In and worked as a group
diligently to bring it back to life. It took a group of individuals that have been
dedicated to seeing this vision thru.
We are one of the lucky two. The 2nd being Tad&apos;s,Neilsen&apos;s,Mearle&apos;s in Visalia,CA. that just openned as a Habit Grill last week.
The topic here is lost drive-ins, I have seen so many close here in the greater L.A. area ever since I was like 6yrs old. The 1st being one not mentioned by 296 ardun.
Henry&apos;s Alhambra on Valley @ 1st.(It was on our Ghost Cruise). An A&amp;W @ Peck Rd.&amp;Lower Azusa, another one @ Del Mar&amp;Rosemead Bl. and of course 2EE&apos;s which was demo&apos;d in 1977 and rebuilt as a walk in only the same year.(Mind you it had the Car Canopy from another famous Drive-In = Carpenter&apos;s Arcadia).

Thanks to all the restaurants patrons that support it and make it out to our cruises
and use the Drive-In feature when they can. Being there most weeks,I&apos;ve noticed that people just like to hang out and not use the drive in feature,but would be disapointed if we did away with it,(Which Jim does during the winter months).

Bad Bob stated above it was the 1st time that he had ever used a Car Hop with his Merc, I remember when he tried to get the Malt through the window,he had to turn it sideways= .

We are coming upon our &quot;Terrible Two Birthday Cruise&quot; since we&apos;re now a Toddler= . Come on out and celebrate with us on 10/19/11. It&apos;s on our regular cruise nite, so hopefully the usual suspects will be on hand to chat and eat some chow with.

Thanx for putting up this thread=so cool to see all of these places! Someday I&apos;ll get around to seeing the ones that still survive. __________________

 NOT a drive-in, but I love to sneak in a classic shot of the long-gone American soda 
 fountain now and then! This soda-fountain shot really grabs the eye, doesn&apos;t it? 
 At the time of the 1935 Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, soda fountains 
 were very popular, and impersonal coin-op &quot;pop&quot; dispensing machines and drive- 
 throughs had not yet displaced them. Known at the time for using provocative 
 artists like Wyeth and Rockwell, Atlanta- based Coca Cola created this show-piece Art 
 Deco fountain for the expo, featuring black marble over a tableau of water nymphs. 
 To me, this photo speaks of a time when human attendants, not machines, still 
 manned a plethora of posts, back before automation and self-serve eliminated so many 
 jobs.

 Somtimes chains or should I say corperations are not a bad thing. Example reply 166 on this thread. Adreine that I had mentioned before worked and made this place a landmark. But sometimes that still does not help. Got knocked down anyway. Well right away she and others hand more on there hands than save and refresh. Cyclone Kevin got onboard and helped Adriene with matters. Things started moving, now they needed a backer. Found a person to do so, but still there was clearly tons more money needed. So in comes Bobs in the picture. See if it wasn&apos;t for Bob&apos;s the rebuilding may have never happened. It toke a big team effort and to all my friends Thanks for bringing back the Broiler.

 I&apos;d vote on it for the INSTANT CLASSIC category! The WHEN is pretty obvious (and 
 check that &apos;vert! ). One of the HAMBers on the Vintage Shots thread thought this 
 is probably Florida (obviously about &apos;47 to &apos;50). A nybody else have a WAG ?

 Speaking of A&amp;W drive-ins, ran onto a nice trove of Canadian A&amp;W 
 vintage shots, several featuring the A&amp;W &quot;Burger Family&quot; members 
 -- a motif that, I suppose, is/was indigenous only to Canada? Anyway, 
 GREAT vintage A&amp;W shots of drive-ins and car hops! All are THANKS 
 to Flick R member AgilityNut!

They still make their own root beer on site and its delicious. It opened in the early 60&apos;s and has always been a popular place. every once in awhile we take the cars. Unfortunately you wont be seeing any A&amp;W&apos;s arround for much longer. they are all being closed and the chain is filing for bankruptcy. Sad to see these small drive-in resturaunts that are popular locally having to close their doors after such prolonged traditions. __________________

 Join Date: Nov 2010 Location: somewhere Posts: 1,972 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants The Adventure Car Hop was the place to be back in the day inSaugus, Mass. If you grew up in the greater Boston area in the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s then you&apos;ll probably have some great memories of this place. Arnie &quot;woo woo&quot; Ginsburg on AM 1510 WMEX was famously listened to and constanly played the Adventure Car Hop Jingle.

 &quot;Gather &apos;round, everybody; &apos;cause you&apos;re about to hear/the show that&apos;s gonna make you/smile from ear to ear/It&apos;s Arnie Ginsburg, on the Night Train show, at 16-hundred...on your radio.&quot; 

 &quot;Adventure Car Hop is the place to go
For food that&apos;s always right.
Adventure food is always just so.
(You&apos;ll relish every bite!)
Out on Route One in Saugus,
Come dressed just as you are.
Adventure, where the service is tops,
And you never get out of your car.&quot;

Route 1 in Saugus Mass was the area&apos;s &quot;route 66&quot;. The Adventure Car Hop was formed around America&apos;s growing fast-food business and the growing obsession with fast cars. Those fast cars needed a place to hang out and garner some street racing. The Adventure was the area&apos;s &quot;Mel&apos;s Drive-In&quot; from American Graffiti. If you were cool; you were sitting in the parking lot listening to the Top 40 with the latest in radio technology and 45 rpm record player mounted under the dash. You would also have rims from &quot;ellis the rim man&quot;.

The Lasso Drive-in Was opened in everett, Mass in 1953. the Adventure was designed by the same people. The Adventure had 2 locations. one in Saugus and one in Natick, Mass. The one in Natick opened in 1955

Chickland wasn&apos;t so much a &quot;drive-in&quot; resturaunt but it was a very famous/popular resturaunt in Saugus, Mass. This photo is circa 1955. Chickland was famous for its BBQ Chicken. There was dancing in the main room. It survived into the 60&apos;s. __________________

I miss the A&amp;W Drive-In that was located in San Gabriel just east of New Ave on Valley Bl. It looked similar to this one and they made Killer Burgers-Loved the Baby Burger w/cheese,It had the same red relish as Bob&apos;s BB. It tasted different though, I believe Walter Marriott owned both chains at the time.

How about the Yankee Doodle Drive-In in San Gabriel at Las Tunas Dr. and California St.?
 

Henry&apos;s Drive-In Alhambra that served Chicken in Rough This is the 1st drive-in that I remember going to eat at in the 60&apos;s and seeing close in 1971 I was very sad.

 Join Date: Apr 2009 Location: Nor Cal Posts: 76 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants This was the drive-in in Fort Lauderdale in the 50s, 60s. Demolished in the 70s - this is the only photo I could find after years searching the internet...

 

I went to Otts once in the early 60&apos;s - &quot;the world&apos;s biggest drive-in&quot;. this is the only picture I could find of it...

 

Anybody got more pictures of these places? __________________

 It&apos;s still a restaurant but not an A&amp;W.

When Roger sold, it retained the the name, no cruise nights anymore. I have another friend who owned an A&amp;W in Santa Maria on South Broadway which was replaced by the present day car wash that is there.

Not only was their chicken great, but they had great breaded pork tenderloin sandwiches. Sometimes I&apos;d go there with my dad when I was a kid for take-out. Huge wax paper bags of greasy fries, too. Kind of a dump, but I loved it. That and Chicken Delight. They used to staple bags of those colored mints to the paper plates with delivery orders...a real treat!

It belonged to WN Casey. The ones in Wichita Falls, I believe, belonged to his brother Raymond.

I miss those 7 for a buck Whizzburgers on Sunday mornings

There was also on Interstate just north of Patton Park and the fire station a very small ice cream shop where according to the Oregon Historical Society was the birthplace of the soft ice cream machines. Long gone and before my time in the neighborhood.

 1950&apos;s Steak-n-Shake Drive-In Restaurant. Anybody know if this is the ORIGINAL one opened 

 by Gus Belt in 1934 when he converted his gas station/chicken restaurant into a burger joint?

 Gulf Breeze was and is a suburb of Pensacola and is located 
 right on the gulf and Pensacola Bay in the Florida panhandle. 
 The fantastic prices seem to show this menu to be from the 
 mid-1960s. Burgers start at 20 cents! Four-piece fried chicken 
 $1.25. Eight-piece family chicken dinner $2.89. Wow!

 In the days of 15-cent hamburgers and not long after the Sputnik phenomenon , BBF eateries 
 featured a wild lighted gizmo above their signs -- sort of a neon-tubed &quot;whirling satellite&quot; on a 
 pylon that glowed day-n-nite. 


 


 From 1961 through 1970, Burger Boy Food-A-Rama -- or just BBF -- of Columbus, OH, gave 
 McDonald&apos;s a good run, operating some 50 restaurants in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. 
 They sold out to Borden which, I be lieve, used BBF locations as the basis for starting the 
 Borden Burger chain and, later, Wendy&apos;s.

 Oh now, this is very cool! Mc Donnell&apos;s predated Mc Donald&apos;s by at least 15yrs, The Clock by about 10yrs. I didn&apos;t even know that there was a Clock in So-Pas. I&apos;m not exactly sure,but I think that it might have been dozed just last year. It had been an Italian restaurant called Gino&apos;s that had been vacant since like 1990.

Someone else said that it had been a Simon&apos;s Drive-In=now I&apos;m on a hunt! 

I remember the Temple City one being changed to a &apos;Tiffany&apos;s&quot; later and &quot;Argo&apos;s&quot; then the building was demolished to make way for a foriegn owned shopping center that now has an Applebee&apos;s on that corner. __________________

 Postcard image ca. 1960 of Carrol&apos;s, 5th St. and Bellevue Ave., 
 Reading, PA. Typical of once-common independent hamburger 
 stands that got replaced by big-chain fast-food joints over 
 the decades. 

 

 Almost certainly shot in &apos;56 or earlier &apos;57, the El Patio Drive-In, 
 Montery, CA. Like the Carrol&apos;s shot, this image is derived from 
 a period postcard. Both are available on eBay at reasonable cost, 
 for anybody wanting cool images for their garage or man cave.

Had the misfortune of eating there a few years ago and the burgers were likely found on the battlefield. Nasty. Place would have potential if someone were to buy it, invest a bit of sweat equity, and promote it as it could be a killer place for a rod meet.

Great info on the Adventure and the Texan in Saugus, MA.

Howard Johnson&apos;s had 2 drive ins nearby. One on the traffic circle, junction of US Rt.1/MA C-1/MA 99, on Rt.1 north, less than 1/2 mile from the Texan. After too many vehicular tragedies on the rotary, a new interchange effectively cut off access to this HoJo&apos;s.

Further northbound, at US Rt 1 and MA Rt, 128 (Lynnfield/Peabody line) sat the second local HoJo&apos;s drive-in. My dad met Tennessee Ernie Ford in the ice cream line back around 1962. This HoJo&apos;s fell to development, and a series of chain restaurants occupied the site to this day.

This is what is left of the Clock Broiler in So Pas.
The is 5 So Pasadena Ave, South Pasadena,CA.

I had a feeling that it was this place, They just dozed it last year. It was Gino&apos;s Restorante for a number of years, Brady Bunch Dad=Robert Reed used to hang out there in the bar having a few drinks. He lived nearby.

I was mis-informed about this site as it was told to me that it was a Simon&apos;s drive-in.
Not so according to that wrapper, It was a Broiler Drive-In. The foundation is still there, It was/is for sale but it had the building which oculd have been restored, hell even now it still could be restored if the economy would just get itself together. __________________

 Wait for this to load fully! HAMBer Empire found this genuine video clip 
 on Tumblr! Notice that the car hop is roller skating! And 40-cent banana 
 splits??? Yow! This appears to be shot live in right about 1956 , as I don&apos;t 
 see any car newer. But I&apos;m at an absolute loss as to whether it&apos;s a TV news 
 clip, a scene from a TV show or, maybe, even a clip from a movie. (?) Em- 
 pire said the only info at Tumblr said&quot;1950&apos;s carhop.&quot; Track it down here:

 These always get my curiosity going. Turns out, there were SEVERAL &quot;Stan&apos;s&quot; drive-ins 
 around the country -- all apparently well loved! This one may have been Stan&apos;s in Provo, 
 featuring beau coup neon lighting! Must have been a sight at night. Below is Stan&apos;s in 
 Fresno, shot by Ed Schober and THANKS the California Historical Society and to the 
 USC Library collections. There&apos;s also a brief quote. My WAG is 1952 or &apos;53 because 
 of the Hudson Jet. 

 

 &quot;An exterior view of Stan&apos;s Drive-In in Fresno, 1950-1959. The restaurant is at center and is a circular 
 building with glass walls and a large overhang around the entire building. Many automobiles are parked 
 in front of the building, and several pedestrians can be seen among the vehicles. At left is a sign adver- 
 tising the restaurant and its fried chicken, sandwiches, and fountain. A large neon waitress can be seen 
 on the sign as well.&quot; [BTW: I think if you look this up, the Library can sell a high-quality print for framing.]

 I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s the location for the 1964 Bruce Davidson photograph below. Also used on a Beastie Boys album cover. Tiny Naylor&apos;s Drive-In is sometimes credited for the photo but I&apos;m thinking it&apos;s Truman&apos;s.

BTW what&apos;s the year and make of the convertible in the shot? I&apos;m thinking &apos;61 Olds.

 Join Date: Nov 2009 Location: Powell Siding, MO Posts: 110 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants I&apos;ve tried to find photos of Ed&apos;s Drive-in that was on North Scott Avenue (Route 71) in Belton in the &apos;50s and 60s. It was built right across the street from our farm house in about 1955. Jack&apos;s Tune-up was built next to it. The Air Force Base had just opened a mile away, and all of a sudden, the town was crawling with young guys with hopped up cars. On a summer&apos;s night, I could hear the car radios tuned to the local top 40 station, with guys peeling out in their flathead Fords, early Dodge hemis and Chevies. The smell of fry grease wafted through the air, across the highway and up to my bedroom window. Any wonder why I&apos;m all over this hotrod thing for the past 60 years?

 The first one is printed Sacramento by pin holes in the lower right, I lived in Merced CA and spent many night at the one in Fresno. Had a roving reporter that would take request as he walked around. Great memories __________________

 Think I found out in this LA Times article on the Westwood Village ( http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la...,5829295.story ) :

&quot;In 1970, a 24-story office building now known as Oppenheimer Tower replaced Truman&apos;s drive-in, a popular hangout at Wilshire and Westwood boulevards. &quot;

Of the three, Taco Treat is the only one left in business last I saw, and still has the original signage - the street numbers must have been changed because it&apos;s now listed as 74 East Live Oak. Check Google street view - it&apos;s a little time capsule. Burger Q is now G&amp;K Burgers with a newer building, convenient to the local Pick-A-Part.

 Join Date: Apr 2002 Location: Temple City, CA. Posts: 2,345 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants G&amp;K uses the existing original building, but turned the layout facing the street as a sit down. They added on to the front of it which took away the left drive thru shown in the yearbook pic= That&apos;s now part of the enclosed dining area. I&apos;m to young to remember this Burger Q location,but do remember others in West Covina and La Habra. The Live Oak Edwards Drive In Movie Theatre was directly across the street from this place. We did a movie with a prop Drive-In that was called POP&apos;S Paradise
Which can be seen in the book Hot Rods by Pete&amp;Jake.

Don&apos;t remember the Fosters either. If the address change, then I have no idea where it was located. Taco Treat on the other hand maintains a great customer base and looks much as it did when the photo was published.

Is there any shots of Bob&apos;s Beef Burger in Arcadia off of Huntington just past 2nd? There was another location on San Gabriel BL. next to Hughes Hardware. __________________

Even the old chrome dinners with the pedestal seats and laminate counter tops.

Sloppy Joe&apos;s were .15 cents and has a kid that was all the money I had at the time.

Why did the food always seem to taste better at these old places?

Just my opinion Jimbo __________________

 That was There Goes My Baby ; I remember when they filmed it in 1990. The restaurant set had a B-25 bomber mockup built into the roof. They redid the drive-in theater sign to say &quot;Paradise&quot; instead of Edwards, listing Cat Ballou on the marquee. The movie sat on the shelf for a while, later (1994) had a very brief theatrical release, then went to video.

It makes me laugh (or want to puke) to see what peoples ideas of what a quote/unquote 50&apos;s diner would look like.

 Chrisbcritter,
You&apos;re right on! We filmed that movie in Oct of 1990. We filmed At Garfierld HS on 6th st in East L.A. ( It was suposed to be Westwood High ), Filmed at a couple of different houses in the valley, a liguor store and mostly at the Edwards Live Oak-Arcadia Drive-In.

Were you there? I had a couple of different cars in the movie, A 34 suede highboy coupe and a black 55 T-Bird with Cragar S/S&apos;s and slightly jacked up, you can see em cruising around and around and around!!!!! The Pop&apos;s set was incredible!!!!

I mean it was basically a real restaurant through and through, it even had a radio station with 93-KHJ alumni Humble Harve to give a bit of flavor. Pulled that movie out recently to give it a looksee, How weird because in that movie they had the Watts riots and 2 yrs later we had them here in L.A.

The media kept bringing up the 20th anniversary of those later riots-When we filmed that movie those L.A. ones had yet to occur. ( The funny thing is that we filmed that scene in the Sante Fe-Mateo-4th st. area which is in heart of downtown and possibly predicted things yet to come ).

Still have my POP&apos;S Paradise sticker on my fridge, would love to dupe it
and run it on my Bird. Loved the 57 hardtop that was owned by the studio, wished that I could have bought it, was a manual car! __________________

 Join Date: Jun 2011 Location: Mesa, AZ Posts: 248 Re: Lost Drive-In Restaurants If you were a car guy in the mid to late 50&apos;s in Peoria, IL, the primary cruising spot was the south side Steak&apos;n Shake located way down Adams Street near the edge of the city. It was the end of a loop that started and ended near downtown. Any night, especially on the weekends, everybody with a cool car (or pretensions of one), made at least one pass around the building, checking out all your friends and acquaintances. Sometime in the late 50&apos;s the company opened another drive-in atop of Main Street hill. This tended to alter the cruising pattern somewhat, since now we had two spots to pass through. Sadly, both are gone now. __________________
