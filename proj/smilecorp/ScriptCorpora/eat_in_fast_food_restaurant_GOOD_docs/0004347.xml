 McDonald’s Sales Drop in Asia Signals Fast-Food Slowdown 
 Posted on June 14, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Bloomberg News By Leslie Patton 

 Chinese consumers may be losing their appetite for American fast food. 

On June 8, McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) reported that same-store sales fell 1.7 percent in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa in May, the biggest decline since at least 2004.

The pullback at the world’s largest restaurant chain coincides with a slowing Chinese economy. That has forced McDonald’s and Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM), which runs the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, to fight back with less-expensive menu items, said Steve West, an analyst at ITG Investment Research in St. Louis.

“We’ve seen a lot of deep discounting by McDonald’s and Yum,” he said. “McDonald’s has been talking about keeping that up in the face of pretty high inflation.”

McDonald’s, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, rose 0.3 percent to $87.97 and Yum fell 0.2 percent to $64.48 at 9:58 a.m. in New York, while the Standard&amp;Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent.

China’s manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace since December, a government report showed on June 1, adding to signs the nation’s slowdown is worsening. A separate purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc (5) and Markit Economics pointed to a seventh straight contraction, the longest stretch since the global financial crisis.

China responded to the slowdown on June 7 by cutting interest rates for the first time since 2008.

 Sales Decline 

The 1.7 percent same-store sales decline at McDonald’s Asia, Middle East and Africa division last month compared with analysts’ projections for a gain of 3.2 percent, the average of estimates compiled by Consensus Metrix. Globally, sales rose 3.3 percent, trailing an estimate for a 5.2 percent increase.

The chain’s division that includes Asia is “seeing challenging economic conditions, with slow growth in China,” Don Thompson, who will become chief executive officer in July, said during a first-quarter earnings conference call in April. Company-operated margin at restaurants in that region narrowed to 16.9 percent in the first quarter from 17.5 percent a year earlier.

McDonald’s has tried to lure customers to its 1,500 stores in China with value lunch items and a new chicken burger.

The company will start selling a value-priced dinner in China “in the coming months,” Thompson said in April.

A slowing Chinese economy comes at a time when Yum is betting on the growing middle class to help it expand. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company, which generated 44 percent of its revenue in China last year and already has more than 4,600 restaurants there, plans to open another 600 locations this year.

 Earnings Growth 

McDonald’s is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on July 23. Net income excluding some items is projected to increase less than 1 percent, according to the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the weakest quarterly earnings growth in three years.

Profit growth at Yum, scheduled to release second-quarter results on July 13, is also slipping. Net income excluding certain items may rise 4.2 percent, which would be the slowest growth since 2008, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

While “China is slowing to some degree,” it’s still a profitable market for fast-food chains, said Larry Miller, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Atlanta, who rates McDonald’s and Yum the equivalent of buy. “I don’t think these guys are making a bad bet.”

 Prices up 1 yuan at McDonald’s 
 Posted on May 17, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : By Li Woke (China Daily) 

McDonald’s Corp has raised the prices of some set menu items for the second time this year in China to offset higher operating costs.

The world’s largest fast-food chain by sales revenue added 1 yuan (16 US cents) to the prices of four of its breakfast and lunch set menus.

It said the move was a“structural price adjustment”but emphasized that it had left the prices of some set meals unchanged and introduced value set meals at the same time.

“I can still afford the present prices as my daughter loves (the food), but if it goes too far, I will visit less often,”said a customer at a McDonald’s outlet in downtown Beijing.

Earlier this year, McDonald’s added 0.5 yuan to 2 yuan to the prices of its Big Mac burger, soft drinks and pies due to the pressure of rising costs.

Since entering the Chinese mainland in 1990, the US fast food giant has opened about 1,400 stores across the country. It aims to open 225 to 250 new stores this year and to expand its network in the mainland to more than 2,000 outlets by 2013.
 
KFC Corp–McDonald’s biggest rival in China–which is owned by Yum! Brands Inc, raised prices in September and again in October.

Pizza Hut, another restaurant chain owned by Yum, also raised some menu items early this year.

Chief Financial Officer Rick Carucci of the parent company of the Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell brands said during a conference call in February that rising food and labor costs at its restaurants in China would likely result in menu prices being increased in 2012.

Another fast food chain, Yoshinoya, said on its website that earlier this year it had increased the prices of some items by 0.5 yuan to 3 yuan.

In February, coffee giant Starbucks Corp added 1 to 3 yuan to the prices of some espresso-based beverages and fresh-brewed coffee to offset higher costs.

“Costs of raw materials, property, labor and transportation have been increasing and that’s expected to continue, so it’s inevitable that restaurant chains hike product prices to protect margins,”said Gong Bo, industry analyst with Beijing United Innovation Capital Ltd.

The consumer price index rose to a three-year high of 6.5 percent last July, but by the first quarter of this year, it had fallen to 3.8 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

 McDonald’s to double number of Chinese employees 
 Posted on May 17, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Bloomberg News By Leslie Patton 

McDonald’s Corp. (MCD), the world’s largest restaurant chain, will hire 70,000 people in China this year, almost doubling its workforce there, as it accelerates new store openings in the Asian nation.

On May 20, all 1,400 McDonald’s stores in China will set up recruitment tables and invite people to apply for restaurant positions, Lisa Howard, a company spokeswoman, said in an interview today. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s first announced the openings in China yesterday, she said.

McDonald’s has about 80,000 employees in China now, Howard said. It will open as many as 250 locations there this year, compared with 200 last year, she said.

The Big Mac seller has sought to compete with Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM)’s KFC and Pizza Hut in China by opening more stores there with drive-throughs and promoting value items during lunch. McDonald’s, which also offers delivery service in China, generated about 22 percent of revenue from the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region last year.

The company rose 0.5 percent to $91.43 at the close in New York. The shares have lost 8.9 percent this year.

McDonald’s has more than 33,500 restaurants worldwide.

 Growth in China to benefit restaurants 
 Posted on April 13, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Nation’s Restaurant News By Mark Brandau 

The world’s largest restaurant brands have been growing rapidly in China, but the country’s dynamic growth holds more potential in the coming decades, even for established powerhouses, according to Bernstein Research.

Speaking during a presentation titled, “The Future of Restaurants in China,” Bernstein’s restaurant analyst Sara Senatore said China’s economy has more room for growth, yielding encouraging prospects for Yum! Brands Inc.’s KFC and Pizza Hut chains, as well as for McDonald’s and Starbucks Coffee.

“China is doing what any country does as it ramps up income curves: spending more on discretionary goods like restaurant visits,” Senatore explained. “It’s not until you hit about $15,000 in disposable income per capita that your demand for that starts to flatten out. There’s a long way to go before that happens in China.”
 While some pressure on restaurant companies’ earnings could come from inflation of food and labor costs, other positive trends like increasing urbanization, wage growth and development of China’s interior could offset that burden, Senatore said. Overall, as more Chinese consumers report having less time to eat at home — and more money for eating away from home — Yum, McDonald’s and Starbucks stand to benefit from China’s explosive growth. Senatore identified the following top trends related to restaurant growth in China: Teatime makes a new daypart 
The Chinese tradition of an afternoon teatime holds plenty of potential for Western restaurant brands, especially since beverages have higher profit margins. A tea-and-snack daypart also gives restaurants a chance to sell new items, like indulgent desserts.

“All four chains have really targeted that [afternoon-tea] market,” Senatore said. “For Starbucks, that’s where almost all the traffic is, and they have almost no breakfast daypart. But Starbucks can use that tradition to introduce people to their brand and to coffee drinking, to the point where the morning daypart might become as prevalent as it is in the U.S.”

She added that some chains use that fourth daypart to repackage items they already offer in a bundled meal to improve value perceptions. Pizza Hut, for example, bundles a treat and a coffee for a price point around 15 renminbi, or about $2, which it can advertise as less expensive than Starbucks, she said.

 Brands head west 

China is a diverse market with development concentrated in the giant coastal cities of China’s eastern seaboard, according to Senatore. The central and western cities of China’s interior have not yet reached the size and purchasing power of the east, but the government is keen on driving growth in those areas and bridging that gap in the coming decades, she said.

Occupancy cost inflation will be a major headwind for brands looking to grow in China, especially in tier-one cities on China’s east coast. Senatore noted that average rents in Shanghai are higher than in New York City. “That makes it very difficult to make money in Shanghai,” she said. “It’s a developed market, and very expensive, so profit growth is going to come from lower-tier cities.”
 
Because of high costs, companies that are relative newcomers to China, such as Dunkin’ Donuts, may struggle to grow outside of major metro markets, where they first must gain a toehold to recruit hourly and managerial talent. McDonald’s and Yum are prepared to build out into China’s central and western regions, where costs are lower and growth potential remains high, according to Senator.

As for Starbucks, its strength in afternoon tea and branding associated with an affluent-lifestyle in China means it’s more likely to concentrate in cosmopolitan urban areas, Senatore noted.

“China will eventually look like the United States does for Starbucks,” she said, “with higher density in urban areas but much lower density in farther-out cities.”

 McDonald’s to Tout Quality in China 
 Posted on March 2, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Wall Street Journal By Laurie Burkitt 

SHANGHAI—McDonald’s Corp. is launching a new ad campaign in China that taps rising worries over food safety and quality in an attempt to win market share from its dominant rival, Yum Brands Inc.’s KFC.

The fast-food giant is planning to air a series of television commercials this summer to portray itself as the fast-food brand in China with the best quality. The ads will feature“100% fresh beef”on the chopping block, farmers picking tomatoes from the vine and chickens eating high-quality feed, according to a company spokeswoman.

Ads will air on Chinese TV networks ahead of and during the Summer Olympics in London, of which McDonald’s is an official sponsor and expects to make an impression on a high number of Chinese viewers.“We’re not out to have the most stores in China, but we want to have the highest quality,”Kenneth Chan, chief executive of McDonald’s China, said in an interview Tuesday. A spokeswoman declined to disclose spending.

McDonald’s ad blitz comes as the company looks for growth in a market dominated by Yum Brands, which runs 3,700 KFC and 626 Pizza Hut outlets there. McDonald’s operates more than 1,400 stores in China and is boosting its investment by 50% this year from a year earlier to open 250 stores, Mr. Chan said. Last year it opened about 200 stores. McDonald’s aims to have 2,000 outlets in China by the end of 2013, he said.

A Yum Brands spokeswoman declined to comment.

China’s dining landscape is becoming increasingly competitive as fast-food chains and casual-dining outlets expand across the country. Sales within China’s food-service industry jumped to 625 billion yuan ($99 billion) in 2011, up 14% from a year earlier, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.

Chinese consumers typically feel that Western food chains use safe ingredients, said Ben Cavender, a senior analyst at China Market Research Group. However, Chinese consumers are weary of food quality in the country after repeated spates of sometimes deadly food-additive scandals and upheavals in which some restaurants were found to cook with oil collected from gutters.

Still, the ad campaign comes as the industry faces increasing scrutiny in China. McDonald’s itself earlier this month said it had never used beef treated with ammonium hydroxide in China, as reports that the company had withdrawn the additive in the U.S. reached the mainland. KFC last year defended its use of powdered soy milk rather than fresh milk after facing online and media criticism, saying the powdered product met quality demands that it couldn’t match with fresh soy milk.

McDonald’s has increasingly sharpened its television advertising to stay competitive in a key growth market, industry experts say. It launched last year a TV ad to spotlight its chicken products, which analysts say have been overshadowed by the chain’s hamburger marketing.

Yum had the advantage of being one of the first restaurant chains to move into and expand across China, which has given it better access to prime locations, has enabled it to move further into the country’s smaller cities, and has protected it from a rising number of competitors, said Torsten Stocker, a partner at U.S.-based consulting firm Monitor Group.

China accounts for less than 3% of McDonald’s profit, executives said last year. That is around $300 million in earnings before interest and taxes for McDonald’s compared with Yum Brand’s reported $900 million of Ebit, according to Michael Kelter, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. McDonald’s doesn’t disclose separate financial data for China.

Yum holds 5.2% market share of China’s food service, compared with McDonald’s 2%, according to Euromonitor.
 
While Yum currently has the lead in China’s food industry, the market isn’t yet set in stone, Mr. Kelter said.“China today is essentially the U.S. of the 1950s, which means there are decades to come of compounding growth as the restaurant market matures,”he said.

Mr. Chan said McDonald’s, which franchises its stores in the U.S. market but is more company-owned and operated in China, is looking for franchise partners in China so that it can pick up the pace of its expansion in the country. It now has 12 franchises in China.

To boost spending for its current customers, McDonald’s is remodeling 120 stores this year, equipping them with wireless Internet so diners will linger, bring their computers, and order more, Mr. Chan said. The company is also targeting on-the-go consumers by adding 100 new dessert kiosks this year and 40% of its new stores will be drive-thrus.

McDonald’s fourth-quarter sales hit $6.82 billion, up 9.8% from the year-earlier period. Quarterly profit rose to $1.38 billion from $1.24 billion.

 Local firms vie for Yum’s slice of the China market 
 Posted on February 3, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Reuters By Terril Yue Jones 

(Reuters)–Four floors up overlooking the bustle of the cavernous Joy City Mall in Beijing, diners take a break from shopping to slurp noodles and nibble on dumplings at an Ajisen restaurant.

It’s an increasingly common sight: Chinese consumers turning to local fast-food alternatives to the long-dominant pair in China—Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) KFC and McDonalds Corp (MCD.N).

Twenty-five years after Yum introduced China to American-style fast food with its first fried chicken store, the two U.S. giants are facing a plethora of Chinese and Asian eatery chains that are steadily munching away at their market share.

As Yum prepares to announce fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, some investors are eyeing its China operations warily. Last week saw a flurry of put options on Yum after McDonalds reported earnings and said foreign exchange fluctuations and other factors could eat into profits in 2012.

But Yum’s China business seems robust. The company said on December 5 that it expects a benefit of $40 million this year from yuan-dollar exchange rates, while operating profit in China is expected to grow 15 percent. It plans to open 600 more locations in China in 2012 at a pace of more than one every day.

China accounted for 36 percent of Yum’s global revenue in 2010 and is estimated to be 44 percent in 2011 and 50 percent in 2012, according to Credit Suisse.

Yum’s biggest challenge comes from a rising torrent of competition as Chinese consumers increasingly have more money to spend and more places to spend it, which could mean slowing growth rates for Yum in the future.

At the Ajisen outlet, stacked above a Starbucks coffee shop and a Burger King restaurant, shoppers headed in and out all afternoon.

“We were just browsing, and stopped here by chance to eat,”said Sun Haihao, 30, an engineer from Sichuan province who was visiting Beijing.

He’s been to Ajisen, a Japanese-style restaurant run by Ajisen (China) holdings Ltd (0538.HK) and KFC in Mianyang city where he lives.“KFC can be too oily,”Sun said.“Ajisen is Asian, so we’re used to it.”

 GROWTH OUTPACES CHINA’S GDP 

A recent Reuters poll showed that economists expect China’s GDP to grow 8.4 percent this year, down from 9.2 percent in 2011. Meanwhile the quick-service restaurant industry is expected to grow around 15 percent, meaning further revenue growth for Yum and McDonalds, even as their market share declines, according to market research firm Mintel.

“KFC and McDonalds are growing outlet numbers, but so are domestic and foreign chains plus independents,”says Paul French, Mintel’s chief China analyst.“The pie is bigger, but the number of players wanting and getting a slice of it are bigger too. A rising tide does not necessarily raise all boats.”

Ajisen is among the legion of upstarts, which include fellow Japanese entrant Yoshinoya (9861.T); Taiwan-owned Dico’s restaurants and 85 Degrees Bakery; Burger King BKCBK.UL, Dairy Queen and Papa John’s Pizza (PZZA.O) from the United States; South Korean-owned Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours bakeries; and a host of Chinese chains such as Golden Jaguar, Yonghe King and Country Style Cooking (CCSC.N).

Many are growing fast, albeit from a smaller base. Ajisen (China) reported a boost in first-half restaurant income last August of 40.8 percent to HK$1.6 billion ($206 million).

Country Style Cooking, a family-style chain offering casual cuisine and focused on western China, increased its locations by 63 percent in 2011, according to China Market Research. Meanwhile, the number of all of Yum brand restaurants in China last year grew 13 percent.

 SUCCESS STORY 

Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum, whose restaurants in China also include Pizza Hut, East Dawning and a stake in Little Sheep, plus Taco Bell and others in the United States, has had remarkable success in China.

It was the first foreign fast-food restaurant chain to set up business here, opening a fried chicken outlet in Beijing in 1987. Today it is by far the largest with nearly 3,500 KFC locations across China, and more than 4,200 restaurants in all, well ahead of McDonalds’1,400 locations.

“KFC restaurants are more profitable than any of its competitors and generate about four times as much revenue per restaurant as its U.S. locations,”says James Roy, senior analyst at China Market Research, a Shanghai-based consultancy.“No other competitor can come close to adding the number of restaurants per year it can,”Roy said.

Yum itself said at the end of the third quarter,“We consider China to be the greatest restaurant opportunity of the 21st century.”

Yum executives were not available to comment further because of the regulatory quiet period before the earnings announcement.

Yum’s 2011 China revenue to be announced on Monday is expected to rise 23.3 percent, a slower pace from 32.6 percent a year before, according to Credit Suisse.

But China is Yum’s growth engine. The company’s chief executive, David Novak, said in December that he expects China to lead global profit gains, projected to be up 13 percent for 2011“despite our disappointing U.S. results”and up 10 percent for 2012, excepting special items.

Rising affluence of the Chinese consumer is behind China’s flourishing casual dining market, according to Yuval Atsmon, a Shanghai-based consultant with McKinsey&amp;Co.

“Look at the population of the upper middle class with an income of more than 100,000 RMB ($15,800) a year. It’s now 15-20 million households, but it will be over 75 million households in five years,”Atsmon says.

 McDonald’s in China undergoes European makeover 
 Posted on January 27, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Want China Times 

Global fast-food chain McDonald’s has been actively transforming its restaurants in China into European-style outlets in order to attract young people in urban areas. In 2011, 100 McDonald’s outlets underwent such transformation and 80% of the outlets in China will undergo the renovation by 2013.

The new European style is intended to reflect simplicity, in contrast to the American restaurant’s traditional style that reflects a high-tempo lifestyle.

“We want to attract young people and make them loyal supporters of the simple and happy lifestyle,”remarks Zeng Qishan, CEO of McDonald’s China.

Last year, several outlets in Beijing and Shanghai installed independent coffee corners. The ongoing renovations involves more fundamental change, including the arrangement of seats, artwork and lighting.

Since its entry into the Chinese market, McDonald’s has embraced the company’s classical yellow and red colors in the decor of its outlets, winning over many children, their parents and other people who like bright colors. Now McDonald’s wants to tap the potential for business meetings and gathering of friends. Its new target customers are young people aged 18-28.

In order to poach customers from coffee chain Starbucks, McDonald’s will offer free Wi-Fi internet access service at its outlets in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen starting in April.

McDonald’s has launched a new slogan:“Reserve some space for happiness,”stressing the slow pace of drinking coffee, in sharp contrast with their old mantra,“I’m lovin’it!”

To support the transformation, McDonald’s increased capital outlay by 35% in 2011 and will boost the outlay by 40% more in 2012. So far, the company has invested 7 billion yuan (US$1.1 billion) in China. A majority of the expenditures have been in opening new outlets and upgrading corporate image.

McDonald’s has more than 1,000 outlets in China, compared with more than 3,000 KFC restaurants. However, its profit margin is five times that of Yum! Brands, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut in China.

McDonald’s plans to further step up its investments in China in order to tap the market potential resulting from the further urbanization of the Chinese population. China’s urban population is set to top 700 million in five years. To capitalize on the trend, McDonald’s plans to establish 1,000 additional outlets in China by 2013.

 McDonald’s Opened 200 Restaurants In China In 2011 
 Posted on January 20, 2012 | Leave a comment 
 Source : China Retail News 

According to McDonald’s China, the international fast food chain opened 200 new restaurants in China in 2011, marking a new expansion record in the country.

With the fast expansion, China has reportedly become the third largest market worldwide for McDonald’s.

To accelerate its development in China, McDonald’s will continue to increase its investment in the marketplace, and its total investments in 2012 is expected to increase by 50% compared with last year. The investments will be mainly used for opening new restaurants, upgrading existing restaurants, and expanding services. The company plans to open 225 to 250 new outlets in China in 2012.

Kenneth Chan, chief executive officer for McDonald’s China, told local media that by restaurant expansion, the Chinese market is the fastest growing market in the global system of McDonald’s. To achieve its development strategy, McDonald’s introduced the franchise model into China in 2011. So far, the company has successfully launched and developed this new model in Zhuhai and Yunnan. Meanwhile, it has developed seven franchisees and two franchised developers, operating a total of 36 restaurants.

In addition, McDonald’s has over 150 drive-through restaurants in China, with an annual growth of 25%. It also has 480 McDelivery sites, 1,000 dessert stations, 280 McCafe stores, and over 1,000 24-hour restaurants in the country.

In 2012, McDonald’s will launch Internet booking services in five Chinese major cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Tianjin.

 Asia Delivers for McDonald’s 
 Posted on December 16, 2011 | Leave a comment 
 Source : Wall Street Journal By Julie Jargon 

When Americans are too busy or lazy to cook, they often place an order with their favorite Chinese restaurant. So who do people in China call when they want food delivered? Increasingly, McDonald’s and KFC.

Delivery is becoming an important part of the growth strategy at McDonald’s Corp. and Yum Brands Inc.’s KFC chain in parts of the world where cities are too crowded and real estate costs too high to justify building drive-throughs.

In cities like Beijing, Seoul and Cairo, armies of motorbike delivery drivers outfitted in colorful uniforms and bearing food in specially designed boxes strapped to their backs make their way through bustling traffic to deliver Big Macs and buckets of chicken wings.

McDonald’s Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division, which accounts for more than a fifth of the company’s revenue and showed same-store sales growth of 8.1% in November, is planning to add delivery service to many of the new restaurants it builds.

Already, 1,500 restaurants out of the division’s 8,800 in 15 countries offer delivery, and it plans to build more than 650 new restaurants next year, with up to 250 of those in China alone.

Yum Brands, which says its Pizza Hut unit was the first Western chain to offer delivery in China, decided in 2008 to test whether chicken would prove as popular a delivery item. Now, KFC offers delivery in more than half its 3,500 restaurants in China, and Yum Chief Financial Officer Rick Carucci estimates delivery will be available in more than 2,000 new KFC restaurants in China over the next decade. The chicken chain also offers delivery in other Asian countries, the Middle East, Central America and Mexico.

As the largest fast-food chain in China, KFC is relying on delivery to help broaden the reach of its brand even more. KFC is opening about 450 new restaurants in China per year, half of which Mr. Carucci says will offer delivery.

At McDonald’s,“we’ve used the slogan,‘If you can’t come to us, we’ll come to you,’”says Tim Fenton, president for the chain’s Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division.

Sun Yu, who works for a media company in Beijing, says he orders from McDonald’s or KFC two or three times per month because it’s“more convenient than going to the restaurant, especially in bad weather.”

“We usually can get the food within 15 minutes after I order, much more quickly than a lot of Chinese food restaurants.”

Mr. Fenton says delivery sales have been posting double-digit growth every year in every country where it’s offered. In Egypt, where McDonald’s first started offering delivery in 1994, more than 30% of total sales come from delivery. And delivery accounts for nearly 12% of McDonald’s sales in Singapore. For KFC, delivery accounts for a third of sales in Egypt and nearly half in Kuwait.

Food delivery is commonplace in many Asian and Middle Eastern cities, from independent restaurants and local chains to hotels.

“In Egypt, you could call the Marriott hotel and have a steak delivered to you,”Mr. Fenton says.

Still, it’s not a model either company plans to export to Western markets. McDonald’s derives about two-thirds of its sales in the U.S. from drive -through customers. Only in rare cases does McDonald’s deliver food in the U.S., such as with 10 restaurants in Manhattan.

For McDonald’s, equipping its restaurants in Asia and the Middle East to handle delivery involves having an area to assemble orders, which are then placed in battery-powered induction heating boxes with vents to keep humidity out so that French fries remain hot without getting soggy.

Cold items are placed in insulated containers with ice packs and both fit onto the back of yellow and red McDonald’s branded motorbikes or electric scooters. Drivers wear yellow and red McDonald’s uniforms and aim to deliver the food within 30 minutes.

In some countries, such as China, customers pay a flat fee of seven yuan, or just over $1, for delivery.

In others, people pay a fee equal to 15% to 20% of their order price. KFC, whose drivers ride red motorbikes equipped with similar heated boxes, charges a flat fee for delivery.

Ivy Hu, who works at an advertising agency in Beijing and recently ordered several McFlurry desserts to share with colleagues, doesn’t mind paying the delivery fee because it saves her from having to wait in line at the restaurant.

“You know, I can’t be bothered to walk even five minutes away, to the KFC near our office, and McDonald’s is a little farther,”says Ms. Hu, 40.

The majority of McDonald’s delivery orders are still phoned in, but the company has started offering Web-based ordering in Singapore and Turkey.

“We’d love to evolve to more Web ordering because it spares the cost of the call center. That’s really the big future for us,”Mr. Fenton says.

Online orders now account for about 40% of the delivery orders for both Pizza Hut and KFC in China.

“We’ll probably stop building call centers as more people buy online,”Yum’s Mr. Carucci says, adding that people tend to order more food online because they don’t feel as rushed as they do when they order by phone.

 McDonald’s November Sales Rise 7.4% on Strength in Asia

McDonald’s Corp. (MCD), the world’s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 7.4 percent globally last month, driven by demand in Japan and China.

Analysts forecast a gain of 5 percent, the average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in Asia, Africa and the Middle East advanced 8.1 percent, the most since December last year, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected a gain of 5.9 percent.

Chief Executive Officer James Skinner has sought to compete with Yum! Brands Inc.’s KFC and Pizza Hut chains in China by accelerating store growth. McDonald’s will open as many as 250 locations in China in 2012 and has opportunities to grow in other Asian nations including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said at an investor meeting last month.

“China is big enough and there’s enough runway for growth for both” McDonald’s and Yum, Peter Saleh, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group in New York, said today in an interview. Right now, McDonald’s is focused on opening free-standing locations with drive-throughs while Yum is in more strip malls, he said.

 Surging Costs 

Sales in all regions topped estimates, helped by peppermint mochas and chicken McNuggets in the U.S. and promotions in Europe. Both U.S. and European sales rose 6.5 percent. Analysts were expecting growth of 5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.

Asia, Africa and the Middle East account for more than 20 percent of McDonald’s revenue. About one-third comes from U.S. restaurants.

McDonald’s, along with other restaurants, is facing surging ingredient costs and has raised menu prices this year. Commodity inflation will be as much as 5.5 percent in the U.S. and 3.5 percent in Europe during 2012, Bensen said last month.

Comparable, or same-store, sales are an indicator of a company’s growth because they include only older restaurants. McDonald’s October comparable-store sales increased 5.5 percent globally.

There are about 33,100 McDonald’s locations worldwide, more than 80 percent of which are franchised.
