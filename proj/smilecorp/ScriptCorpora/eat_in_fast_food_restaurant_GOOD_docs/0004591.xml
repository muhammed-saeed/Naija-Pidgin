Does this mean they&apos;re going to try to ship us a cookbook and charge for it..... Reply With Quote 03-19-2011,  09:29 AM #3 doctordog

 Registered User Join Date Feb 2003 Posts 62 It WILL be yours after you pay the invoice they send you for the cookbook. When you look at the info form, the&quot;Submit&quot;button says&quot;Submit my Order.&quot;You are ordering a cookbook and I trust you will get a bill for it, so the magazines aren&apos;t really free.
