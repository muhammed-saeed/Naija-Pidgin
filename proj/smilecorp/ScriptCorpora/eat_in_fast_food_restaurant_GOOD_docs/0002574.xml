 Restaurant Categories: 



 Fast Food Restaurant 
Fast food is the most familiar restaurant to most people. Chains like McDonalds and Burger King became popular in the 1950s, and helped spawn countless other concepts like Taco Bell, KFC and In&amp; Out Burger. Fast food service attracted customers for its speed and convenience. Fast food restaurants are typically chains. If you are thinking of opening a fast food franchise, keep in mind that the initial costs of franchising are more expensive than opening an independent restaurant.



 Fast Casual Dining/Bistro 
 This is one of the biggest trends right now. Fast casual is slightly more upscale than fast food. Fast casual restaurants offer disposable dishes and flatware, but their food tends to be presented as more upscale, such as gourmet breads and organic ingredients. Open kitchens are popular with fast casual chains, where customers can see their food being prepared. Boston Market is classified as fast casual.



 Casual Style Dining 
Also known as family style dining in North America. Casual style restaurants offer moderately priced entrees. This is one of the largest markets in the North America right now. Causal style dining can be any number of themes, from Italian (Olive Garden) to seafood (Red Lobster) to Mexican ( Chilis ). Casual style restaurants offer table side service, non-disposable dishes, while still keeping the menu moderately priced.



 Fine Dining 
Just as the name implies, fine dining is used to describe a much more upscale restaurant, one that offers diners an elegant atmosphere with high quality service. The chefs in fine dining restaurants are usually professionally trained, and the food is fairly expensive, but worth it.
