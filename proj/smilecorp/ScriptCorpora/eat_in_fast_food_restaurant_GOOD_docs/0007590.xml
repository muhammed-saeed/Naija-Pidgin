Can I sue a fast food restaurant?
 Everytime I purchase food from them and I found out that, what you see on the photographs is not what you get. They look very delicious on the photographs and I get lettuce that half dead or dried scarmbled eggs.

 you can sue anyone for anything, but your chances in winning for a peety suit like that against their corporate attorneys are one in a trillion.

 You shouldn&apos;t sue for faulty photographs. Other chains might deliver what is shown. Instead you need to complain at the time the food is presented to you. Though they are not always happy, the customer is always right - (well most of the time). If you don&apos;t complain at the time it happens, then the blame is on you. Go through the manager, if not satisfied, go higher.

 What you see isn&apos;t always what you get, but you should sometimes should trust your instincs. Just take the gross stuff off of the sandwich and throw them away or ask for a replacement sandwich.

 Depends on just how bad it looks. Common sense would point out to you that pictures used to advertise anything will always look better than the real thing. You may be able to sue under the truth in advertisement law but depending on the circumstances of your particular case, you may not win. Technically you can sue any body for anything but that doesnt mean youll win.

 You can sue, but you won&apos;t win. The mcdonalds and wendy&apos;s and arbys give a certain amount of meat. I think it&apos;s because it helps them save money, and you pay less.

Also, they don&apos;t have a garentee on what their food looks like. All they want you to do is buy from them. You get what you pay for.

 false advertising! tsk tsk.

but then again, consider the amount you&apos;re paying for the food you&apos;re getting... since it&apos;s fast food and it costs cheaper, then most likely you will get food that is worth what you paid for. :-)

also, if other people complain about the same thing as your complaints, they will not advocate the fast food chain. if less people go that restaurant, then that would defwhich will definitely hurt the fast food chain.... this is what you call karma. :-)

thus, i don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth suing. eat at another fast food chain instead. :-)

 You proabably could... but you most definately wouldn&apos;t win.

The pictures are&quot;hyped&quot;up, the food is painted with a clear paint like chemical to make the food look better in pictures. If your going to fastfood places often then you know what your gunna get, if you sued you&apos;d proably be asked&quot;so, why do you keep coming back?&quot;
