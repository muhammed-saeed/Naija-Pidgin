 TGIF 

J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College is hoping to attract new students this fall -- and save them gas at the same time -- by offering a number of core courses on Fridays at its Parham campus. The school&apos;s &quot;Fuel Smart Fridays&quot; program would allow students to earn credits in as many as four subjects by attending classes on Fridays only during the fall semester. Eight classes in six subjects (math, English, art, history, psychology and information technology) are available. School officials estimate that a student who otherwise would have traveled 100 miles a week to and from five days of classes would save about $1,085 and 1,280 miles per semester in fuel. That&apos;s almost the same amount as tuition for four three-credit courses ($1,117). While the program may assist some returning students, it was designed primarily to attract new ones who otherwise couldn&apos;t afford to miss work or pay for fuel in order to attend several days of classes, said JSRCC&apos;s Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs, Nanette Smith . The idea for the program came from the dean of JSRCC&apos;s School of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences Barbara Glenn , who had learned of a similar program at the Volunteer State Community College in Tennessee, Smith said. JSRCC officials had been seeking ways in which to attract new students. &quot;I liked it, I took it back to my [administrative] team, and they liked it,&quot; Smith said. Officials settled on Fridays for the program because the campus had the most available class space on that day, Smith said. Smith conceded that the school may not realize the full potential of the program this semester since it decided to introduce it late in the summer. The spring semester, she said, will provide a more realistic look at how successful the program will be. Students can&apos;t complete enough credits on Fridays alone to fulfill a fulltime credit load, &quot;but they can get a pretty good start,&quot; Smith said. Officials anticipate that at a minimum, those who sign up for the Friday courses will reduce their number of weekly trips to campus from five to three. JSRCC officials are using the program as a pilot, to determine whether to offer it at their Richmond and Goochland campuses in the future, Smith said. The campus bookstore will receive a list of all students signed up for the courses so that on their first day of class, all of their textbooks already will have been pulled for them and they&apos;ll have a separate checkout line to speed the process, Smith said. Extra tutors also are lined up for the students. &quot;We have really involved just about the entire school,&quot; Smith said. Students can register for courses online at www.reynolds.edu , on campus or by phone ((804) 371-3308). Normal registration ends Aug. 25 (the first day of classes) but late registration will be available through Aug. 29, which is also the first day of Fuel Smart Friday classes.

 Treasure Huntin&apos; 

Hidden scrolls. Invisible ciphers. A golden idol. Indiana Jones wasn&apos;t the only one searching for treasure over Memorial Day weekend. The fourth annual Great Virginia Race pitted eight teams against an assortment of codes, riddles and clues as they rushed to claim the prize: a statue of a golden gnome. The treasure hunt is one of many such races created by Ravenchase Adventures , a Richmond company that specializes in bringing adventure to life with elaborate puzzle-based games. This hunt is one of the hardest, spanning two days and seven cities and towns in central Virginia. First-time players Scott White and Merrit Stanley realized they were in for more than a simple scavenger hunt when they received their starting location info ... in code.   &quot;When we got the clue, we were almost ready to send our money back,&quot; Stanley said.   Veteran Ravenchasers agreed that the first race is the hardest, but players will keep coming back for more. Indeed, with the exception of Scott and Merrit (Team Merriot), all of the teams were repeat participants of Ravenchase events and in many cases the Great Virginia Race itself.   So what&apos;s the attraction?   The opportunity to live out the sort of adventures previously reserved for works of fiction is a draw for many. But it seems that these treasure hunts offer more than escapism. Repeat players all describe the sense of community with other fans of the games.   &quot;If it hadn&apos;t been for Ravenchase, we never would have met,&quot; veteran Ravenchaser Randy Pittman said of his friends from other teams. Pittman and his teammate, Kathryn Swadgelo , are both professors at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College.   In addition to camaraderie, Swadgelo cited another attraction: Every time you play, you learn something new about the city you&apos;re in.   This year&apos;s players were a mixed bag of puzzle junkies and thrill seekers. Some players brought their own cipher wheels and code books; others, their dogs.   The returning champions, self-named Team Brilliant, arrived at the starting point wearing walkie-talkies, team shirts and kilts. They congregated around the Tredegar Iron Works on Saturday morning to sign waivers, discuss the rules and of course talk trash. Ravenchase employee Chris Dove officially began the contest.   The good-natured talking and joking quickly gave way to cut-throat competition as the first clues were revealed. Teams scattered to prevent opponents from eavesdropping on their solutions. Throughout the day, the top three teams remained neck in neck as they raced across the Virginia countryside, searching colleges, museums and even seed stores for clues.   Once discovered, clues usually must be deciphered using knowledge of codes and other techniques. A popular example is the Vigenère cipher (pronounced &quot;veedj-ih-nair&quot;) - a type of encryption in which one letter of the alphabet is substituted for another. For examples, click here . Sometimes, innocent bystanders asked why contestants were shining black lights on ancient looking scrolls or dunking them in water. &quot;To reveal secret messages&quot; is the obvious answer, but there&apos;s another hidden purpose in the public nature of the contest.   Ravenchase Adventures doesn&apos;t usually make a profit on public races, according to company officials. The $100 entry fee for the Great Virginia Race barely covered the cost of the company&apos;s props, research and other expenditures. However, the public races help advertise the profit-oriented aspect of the business.   Ravenchase offers pre-written and custom adventures for corporate events and private individuals. With larger budgets, these can be far more elaborate than the public races. One adventure saw client teams revealing laser alarms with cigarette smoke while attempting to sneak into a bank vault, all pre-arranged by Ravenchase employees.   The employees themselves are almost always former players.   &quot;You have to be a player to have a thorough understanding of how to put these things together.&quot; said Lisa Duty , mid-Atlantic regional director for Ravenchase Adventures. Duty shares her position with Dove; together, they created and ran the Memorial Day weekend race.   &quot;There&apos;s a huge expectation that it will be challenging,&quot; Duty said. She and Dove are constantly searching for new puzzles to foil repeat racers.   Despite the new puzzles, experience paid off in the end: Team Brilliant took home the golden gnome for the third year in a row. The race ended on Sunday afternoon in Shockoe Slip at Sin É Irish Pub&amp;Restaurant . According to members of the winning team, Guinness is a staple of these gatherings.    With the end of the race and the advent of beer, everyone became friends again. Contestants talked about the difficult puzzles and misadventures of the day, and everyone applauded when the neophyte Team Merriot finally crossed the finish line.   Dove and Duty looked pleased at the successful conclusion of the race. &quot;Some people take briefcases to work,&quot; Duty said. &quot;We get to bring a treasure chest.&quot;

 Odds and Ends 

AWARDS CarMax &apos;s internal public relations team recently won PRWeek &apos;s 2007 Small Corporate Communications Team of the Year award. A national survey conducted by a partnership of leading music and educational organizations identified Chesterfield County Public Schools as among the &quot;Best 100 Communities for Music Education in America.&quot; Thousands of school staff and parents, representing communities in all 50 states, participated in a web-based survey sponsored by the NAMM Foundation and its American Music Conference division. The 2007 winners include school divisions from 31 states that are committed to quality music education programs and providing access to music education. ACADEMIA The Center for Teacher Education at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College has been awarded a $75,000 grant from the Community Foundation to establish an Urban Teacher Institute. The Urban Teacher Institute will develop a pre-collegiate program for City of Richmond high school students interested in urban teaching careers. It will also offer improved professional development opportunities for new and current teachers working in City schools. The center will offer a four-day colloquium for urban teachers this summer. J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College serves as a gateway to teacher education. Students can complete their first two years of teacher preparation courses, receive an associate degree and then transfer to a four-year college or university. For more information about the Center for Teacher Education, contact Dr. Harriet Morrison at (804) 523-5543. ADVERTISING&amp;MARKETING Qorvis Communications , a strategic communications firm with integrated advertising, public relations and interactive capabilities, announced that it has been chosen to be the agency of record for the Virginia Lottery . The account, worth nearly $20 million in total billings annually, represents one of the largest and most coveted advertising accounts in the region. The Qorvis win follows a rigorous search by the Virginia Lottery, which reviewed many of the region&apos;s top advertising agencies during a six-month, multi-round selection process. The account comes only months after Qorvis enhanced its advertising capabilities through the acquisition of the award-winning ad agency Sparky&apos;s Garage in October 2006. BENEVOLENCE Virginia Baptist Children&apos;s Home&amp;Family Services , which has four homes for special needs adults in Richmond, will now be known as HopeTree Family Services . The agency said the change was necessary for many reasons including the fact that its programs have expanded to include residential care for adolescents, family counseling, group homes for special needs adults and many other services that aren&apos;t truly represented by the term Children&apos;s Home.&apos; The new name was selected on the basis of the agency&apos;s desire to develop a unified identity that equally encompasses all programs and services while retaining a significant degree of its established image. HopeTree Family Services will continue all the programs, services, and practices performed by Virginia Baptist Children&apos;s Home&amp;Family Services which include: residential and emergency placement for youth, two wilderness camps, foster care and adoption services, and more than a dozen group homes for adults with developmental disabilities including the Stephenson, Houston, Heinrich and Waldbaur Homes in Richmond. Established in 1890, the agency accepted its first residents in 1892 and has operated continuously since. CONSTRUCTION SERVICES W. M. Jordan Company announced that it is expanding its operations in Richmond&apos;s Manchester region. Prompted by an outlook for continued growth of commercial development in metro Richmond, the company plans to double the size of its current office building at the corner of Bainbridge Street and Commerce Road. The project is expected to break ground this in March and be completed by the end of October. The new two-story building will exceed 15,000 square feet and will feature a more contemporary exterior façade, expanded parking and more landscaping and green areas. The company is working with Baskervill&amp;Son to design the new facility, which is planned to have a cleaner, more modern appearance although it should mesh with historic structures in the neighborhood. The new building will incorporate environmental design principles and apply for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. The project team also includes structural engineers Dunbar, Milby, Williams, Pittman&amp;Vaughan and RK&amp;K;Consulting Engineers. In addition, W.M. Jordan Company was assisted by the Greater Richmond Partnership and the City of Richmond Department of Economic Development. FRANCHISES Smartbox , a Richmond-based portable self storage comapny founded in 2004, announced its eighth new franchise location since the middle of 2006. Minneapolis, which will open this spring, joins Atlanta, Baltimore, Denver, Jacksonville, Fla., New Orleans, Raleigh, N.C., and San Antonio as franchises that have opened in the past 10 months. LOCAL FORTUNE 1000 NEWS Genworth Financial Inc. recently announced several strategic steps to align high-growth business platforms and better position the company globally as the financial security company of choice for distributors and consumers. The company expects to make approximately $100 million of investments in these initiatives over two years. In addition, the company has identified approximately $220 million of cost savings and efficiencies over the same period. Net after-tax savings to the company are expected to be approximately $75 million over two years and are consistent with the company&apos;s previously stated earnings outlook for 2007. Investment initiatives and details of efficiencies include the expansion of the company&apos;s retirement and protection segment sales and wholesaling forces; investments in multiple global growth platforms including country expansion initiatives across Europe and elsewhere; and enhancements to investment and capital markets innovation programs. New growth investments will include a 20 to 25 percent expansion in the number of U.S.-based wholesalers and sales support staff across retirement, life insurance and long-term care insurance lines, to maximize distribution capabilities. Additional investments are being made in programs designed to further Genworth&apos;s leadership in designing capital markets solutions to enhance balance sheet efficiency. Internationally, additional investments will be made in recently entered and potential new countries that, coupled with expansion of established platforms, will support accelerating global growth. Hanover-based Owens&amp;Minor announced that it has completed the transition of the acute-care distribution business acquired from McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., a business unit of McKesson Corporation, on Sept. 30, 2006.

 Cleaning the Slate 

Mayor L. Douglas Wilder announced the creation of his School System Oversight Committee on Tuesday during a press conference at Oak Grove Elementary School. The committee will scrutinize the actions of the city&apos;s School Board and administration and advise the mayor on how to rectify the systemic problems of the school system. The eight-person committee will be comprised of leaders from the worlds of Richmond business and education. Dr. Robert D. Holsworth , a VCU political science professor, has been appointed chairman. &quot;The bottom line is that Richmond&apos;s public education system remains at a point of crisis and if the School Board and administration are unable or unwilling to address it, then my administration as the system&apos;s single largest fund provider has a duty to step in and hold them accountable,&quot; Wilder told a bevy of reporters and TV crews. Wilder said the formation of the committee represents a step toward ending the &quot;complacency and dysfunctionality that plagues Richmond City Schools,&quot; which he labeled &quot;one of the best-funded yet poorest-performing districts in the Commonwealth of Virginia.&quot; During his address, Wilder cited the school system&apos;s poor statistics in the areas of safety, truancy and drop-out rates. For example, Richmond schools average 135 incidents of violence and discipline per day, with the drop-out rate being six times the state average, he said. Despite the fact that several schools within the system recently attained SOL accreditation status, Wilder said academic improvements were needed. He said two schools lost accreditation status this year and the system as a whole is well below average for SOL scores. Stephen B. Johnson , chairperson of the school board, was present at the conference. Johnson told reporters that he welcomed the opportunity to work with the committee but said the board had already been working on several problems within the school system. &quot;We&apos;ve taken steps and will continue to take steps,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But we can&apos;t do it alone. We need help in many areas.&quot; Wilder himself said he is not looking to curtail the activities of the board and hopes they can work together. &quot;There is no reason to be at loggerheads because the only people that suffer in that regard are the kids who need an education,&quot; he said. &quot;And we can&apos;t afford to have it continue as it has been for the past several years.&quot; The site of Tuesday&apos;s press conference was not without significance. Oak Grove Elementary School is currently under investigation by the state Board of Education for SOL testing irregularities. &quot;It underlines the need to be certain that we tie the education of children more closely to the vision and the goal, rather than to what SOLS proclaim to be,&quot; Wilder said of the decision to announce his new committee at Oak Grove. &quot;SOLS, at best, were designed to be baseline, not the line.&quot; Wilder said the committee would operate for as long as he remains mayor. He said he expected them to &quot;to hit the ground running and start right away.&quot; Members of the committee include: Heidi Abbott , Attorney, Hunton and Williams; Dr. William C. Bosher, Jr. , professor of education at VCU and former superintendent of the state Board of Education; Dr. Billy K. Cannaday , superintendent of Chesterfield County Public Schools; William H. Goodwin, Jr. , chairman of CCA Industries; Barbara Grey , retired principal of several Richmond schools; Melvin Law , former chairman of the Richmond School Board; and Dr. Gary L. Rhodes , president of J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College.

 Celebrated Chefs 

A few weekends ago, two culinarily-inclined Richmonders traveled to Philadelphia to don chefs hats and compete against the best of the best in young chefdom. Both Paul Hubbard , a sous chef who has worked at Franco&apos;s Ristorante for the past four years, and Julian Davis , a line cook at Morton&apos;s Steakhouse in Shockoe Slip, received bronze medals, which aint bad, particularly considering the company they were keeping. The Young Chef Rôtisseur Competition was sponsored by the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs , a by-invitation-only international gastronomic society founded in Paris in 1950. The organization aims to promote the art of fine dining and preserve the camaraderie and pleasures of the table through its privileged membership of both amateur and professional gastronomes. The society also sponsors scholarships and competitions to encourage the development of young professionals like Davis, who is currently enrolled in the culinary arts program at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, and Hubbard, who, in 2003, was the youngest member ever to be inducted to the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs at the age of 19. Both Hubbard, 22, and Davis, 21, were nominated to participate in the Mid-Atlantic competition by the Richmond chapter of the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs, headed by former chef Karen Sherwood . &quot;The greatest part of what we do is perpetuating the future of fine food and wine,&quot; said Sherwood, who, after four and a half years of service as President of the Richmond Bailliage (chapter), is stepping down at the end of this year. &quot;The Young Chef Competition challenges these young chefs to do their best and prepares them for a brilliant career.&quot; The competition is an Iron Chef type event in which each of the six contestants is given a mystery market bag of ten ingredients that they must use to prepare a three-course meal for the set of four judgesall within a four-hour time span. This year&apos;s basket included sweetbreads, a shoulder of lamb, oysters, spinach, pine nuts, barley and white chocolate. After receiving the grab bag of foodstuffs, contestants, who have to be 26 years old or younger to participate, have 30 minutes to design a menu, three hours to prepare the meal and 30 minutes to present the food for judging. Sounds a bit harrowing, doesn&apos;t it? &quot;It really wasnt stressful at all,&quot; said Hubbard, who also took home a bronze medal from his first Young Chef Competition two years ago. &quot;It&apos;s a lot fun and very organized. It&apos;s a good competition.&quot; &quot;It was a lot of fun,&quot; agreed Davis, &quot;and at the same time it&apos;s amazing how much I learned in one day. I got a lot of positive feedback from the chefs there and the judges.&quot; The Mid-Atlantic regional winner, a chef from Malvern, Pa., received a silver medal and the opportunity to participate in the national finals, which is being held in Las Vegas this year. The winner of that contest then goes on to Bermuda for the international finals. The remaining regional contestants ended up with bronze medals and the desire to come back and win it the next time. &quot;I gave the first place winner a run for his money,&quot; said Hubbard. &quot;I dont know how I lost. I think I just wasnt meant to win this one. Im going to go back in a couple years and do it again.&quot; In addition to providing an outlet for young epicures to show their stuff, the competition also offers significant educational and networking opportunities. &quot;With competition like these when you&apos;re working with young chefs, they don&apos;t like to put so much emphasis on winning,&quot; said David Quisenberry , who as executive chef at Morton&apos;s, has been able to watch Davis&apos; development. &quot;They want to focus on what you are getting out of it as experience. There is constant feedback before, during and after the competition. It&apos;s very fulfilling.&quot; &quot;It also gives them a chance to network with peers on their level,&quot; said Sherwood. &quot;Paul and Julian will always remember the men that competed with them. They&apos;ll be lifetime friends.&quot; Both Hubbard and Davis are homegrown talent, having gotten their starts as teenagers at Franco&apos;s and Ledo Pizza, respectively, and they are no strangers to receiving accolades for their creations. Hubbard won the 2004 March of Dimes Chef&apos;s Auction, and Davis received a medal at last year&apos;s Virginia Chef Association competition, which he also plans to enter this year. As for professional dreams, each look forward to a future that includes established reputations and restaurant ownership. No doubt their talent and passion will lead them wherever they want to go. Just ask anyone who&apos;s tasted their work at Franco&apos;s or Morton&apos;s. As Davis unabashedly put it: &quot;The proof&apos;s in the pudding.&quot;

 From A(lligator) to Z(ebra) 

Henrico Citizen -- Nationally known wildlife photographer Lynda Richardson has been swarmed by bats in a Cuban &quot;hot cave,&quot; nibbled by crocodiles in Africa, and mobbed by fire ants while she caught loggerhead sea turtles on film laying their eggs. She&apos;s photographed CEOs, truck drivers, and Supreme Court justices; documented dolphin die-offs and presidential soirees; and survived a hostile encounter with armed militants on the Columbian border. On Feb. 25, however, she can be found in the relatively tame confines of the Henrico County Administration Boardroom, sharing photos and stories of her travels as part of the Fifth Annual Adventure Series. Since a complete account of her adventures would require several evenings, Richardson will limit the slide presentation to experiences in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. She&apos;s the first to admit that even tracing her career path is an adventure in itself. &quot;It&apos;s like a charmed life,&quot; she says of the string of random events that propelled her into her calling. &quot;I can&apos;t figure out how all this happened!&quot; Twists in the Path to Success Growing up in Richmond and attending St. Catherine&apos;s, Richardson had no thought of a photography career, although she edited her school yearbook and vividly remembers getting her first camera in third grade. A fondness for animals inclined her toward veterinary school, until chemistry struggles at Mary Washington College caused her to reconsider and switch to art. Told she had talent for art and photography, she remembers musing to herself, &quot;Well! Sculpture. What do you do with that?&quot; So she took a graduate photography course at VCU, and soon accepted a challenge from Professor John Heroy to attend the month-long Photographic Workshop in Maine. &quot;That did it!&quot; she exclaims. &quot;It&apos;s like boot camp in photography. It was awesome!&quot; Once she returned from boot camp, the chain of events picked up pace. At a camera shop, photographer Mark Mitchell approached her and suggested her athletic look was ideal for an ad shoot of a jogger. Although she wasn&apos;t chosen as the model, the acquaintance with Mitchell led her into an informal apprenticeship. &quot;That&apos;s really what kicked me off [on photography as a career],&quot; she says of the relationship with Mitchell. Through him, she connected to a photography job at Kings Dominion, where she met a National Geographic photographer and traveled with her to South Africa. Another photographer she met at Kings Dominion began asking her for spur-of-the-moment help with location shoots. &quot;He&apos;d call me up,&quot; recalls Richardson, &quot;and say things like, &apos;There&apos;s a ticket for you at the airport for Key Biscayne. Meet me there on Tuesday.&quot; And she would go - because &quot;everyone I worked with, I learned tons from.&quot; Lion Eyes One day, when Lion Country Safari was still part of Kings Dominion, a photographer from the Richmond daily came to cover a dentist who was treating a lion. Richardson took pictures, too. The newspaper called later to ask if she&apos;d gotten any good shots, and ended up using her striking photo of a dentist calmly probing the drugged lion&apos;s mouth - while the beast&apos;s wide-open eyes stared directly into the camera. The picture was picked up by the Associated Press, and next thing she knew, Richardson was &quot;stringing&quot; for Associated Press. A sequence of pictures she took of John McEnroe grimacing and slamming his racket at a local tennis tournament was soon picked up on the wire as well. For the next three years, Richardson worked as a photojournalist, attending commencements and White House affairs and shadowing political campaigns. Her election night photos of Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles and Lt. Gov. Doug Wilder celebrating victory ran in U.S. News and World Report; other photos began running in Business Week, USA Today and Newsweek. Meanwhile, on weekends, she took pictures of her pets and local wildlife, and began building a reputation for nature shots. &quot;News photography was an ego trip,&quot; she says. &quot;A big head rush. But it began losing its appeal.&quot; Eventually, it dawned on her that she could combine interests in animals and photography into a career, and before long - with a little help from those earlier connections - she had assignments with Smithsonian, National Wildlife, and The Nature Conservancy. &quot;This is Gonna Hurt!&quot; Since turning full-time to outdoor photography in 1986, she&apos;s earned an international reputation and been named one of the top female outdoor photographers in &quot;Nature&apos;s Best Magazine.&quot; In addition, she was recently accepted into the prestigious &quot;Pro-Tour of Nature Photography,&quot; a month-long competition limited to 20 photographers from around the world. Along the way, she&apos;s enjoyed an education only the great outdoors can provide. Whether climbing trees in Panama for glimpses of three-toed sloths, or visiting the Galapagos for close-ups of giant tortoises, she studies her subjects&apos; eating, breeding and migration habits, sleeping routines, nesting sites, and predators. She has sampled exotic game from alligator to zebra meat; tasted hippo, piranha, elephant, crocodile, hartebeest, whale, caribou, moose, fried eel - even the eggs of the black-bellied whistling ducks she photographed in El Salvador. On a collection expedition to Ecuador, she also helped dissect bats after photographing them. &quot;So I know where a bat&apos;s spleen is, baby!&quot; she boasts with a laugh. And as someone who&apos;s been threatened by African hippos, elephants in Tanzania, and a sea lion in the Galapagos, she appreciates the importance of a proper approach. &quot;I know how to walk up on a lion kill and not get eaten,&quot; she says. &quot;I know how to sneak up and get close to an elephant. And I know when a hippo is bluff charging.&quot; The one time she feared for her life was during a human encounter in coastal Ecuador, when her two-car caravan rounded a corner to meet drawn guns at a border checkpoint. &quot;I&apos;m in the back seat, leaning on the front seat, and the guys with guns swung them off their shoulders.&quot; She and her companions managed to talk their way through the checkpoint, and Richardson can laugh now at the memory of what flashed through her mind. &quot;All I could think was, &apos;Oh, this is gonna hurt!&apos; &quot; Developed in Infancy? When not globe-trotting, Richardson shares her passion for photography by teaching at Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens and J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, and pursues her love of animals by volunteering with a rescue group. A self-confessed soccer nut, she referees and plays on two senior teams with Chesterfield Women&apos;s Soccer Association. She and her husband, a fishing guide, have a home near Pony Pasture, and she likes to marvel, &quot;How many people can live in a city and see bald eagles from their window?&quot; But the real marvel, she believes, is all the breaks she enjoyed as she traveled that wandering career path. &quot;It&apos;s like someone set my life up! All these coincidences,&quot; she laughs, &quot;can&apos;t be just coincidences.&quot; Was it destiny, then? Or was it chemistry? Her father is convinced of the second one. A reporter at the Tampa Tribune when Lynda was born, Steve Richardson especially enjoyed photojournalism. He cut his newspaper career short after his father suffered a heart attack, and returned to Richmond to take over Bill&apos;s Barbecue, the family business. As she tells the story, Lynda Richardson rolls up a sleeve and points out her skin&apos;s yellowish cast - especially visible in summertime, when she sports the proverbial golden tan. &quot;So my dad jokes, &apos;When you were a baby I used to give you baths in the kitchen sink where I processed film.&apos; &quot;&apos;All those chemicals - photography is in your blood!&apos;&quot; The Adventure Series kicks off Feb. 11 with wildlife photographer Teta Kain&apos;s visual tour of The Great Dismal Swamp. Lynda Richardson will present &quot;On Assignment in Central America&quot; Feb. 25. Presentations are free and begin in the Henrico County Administration Board Room at 7:30 p.m. For information on additional lectures, call Dan Caston at 501-5807.

On Tuesday, September 14, the Community College Workforce Alliance (CCWA) will host a Plant Engineering and Maintenance Summit for manufacturers in the greater Richmond and Petersburg area. The summit will be held at John Tyler Community Colleges Chester Campus in the Nicholas Student Center from 8:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. Russell Hink, an engineer at SKF, will kick off the summit with advice about reducing costs and increasing bearing life through better lubrication decisions. Other sessions feature such topics as laser alignment, vibration analysis and root cause failure analysis, as well as local success stories. The afternoon sessions will facilitate strategic networking among participants regarding their most urgent maintenance concerns. The technical seminar was designed by and for manufacturing and industry managers with the aim of creating a regional maintenance network and improving maintenance operations for Richmond-area manufacturers. &quot;With increasingly tight budgets, area industrial maintenance managers are unable to travel to national meetings or to send their technicians away for training. There is great interest in establishing a continuing regional maintenance network for collaboration on training and other issues,&quot; said Ronald D. Laux, vice president of workforce development for J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) and John Tyler Community Colleges (JTCC). &quot;CCWA is committed to assisting these companies in establishing a network and in training technicians in maintenance and manufacturing skills in an effort to provide a strong manufacturing workforce for the future.&quot; The key objective of the summit will be the development of a seminar series for technicians that will feature local manufacturers  actions they have taken, the successes they have had and the lessons they have learned. A secondary objective is the establishment of relationships among local manufacturing companies so that they can share information, expertise and even spare parts. The event is sponsored by CCWA, the Richmond chapter of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, SKF and the Virginia Department of Business Assistance. Registration ranges from $40 to $75 per person based on pre-registration or registration at the door. CCWA combines the workforce development units of JSRCC and JTCC to better address the workforce development needs in the Commonwealth. CCWA designs, develops and delivers customized and open enrollment workforce training and support services for corporate, government and individual professionals and economic development programs for new and expanding industries. CCWA serves 30,000 workforce students and 1,000 companies and government agencies annually. In the areas of technology training and support services, CCWA addresses personal computer skills and applications, information technology industry certification preparation and other corporate advanced manufacturing technologies. In addition, CCWA also provides many other customized programs for industry in the areas of management and supervision, communication skills, quality and productivity improvements, safety and OSHA, manufacturing skills, customer service and small business training and assistance.
