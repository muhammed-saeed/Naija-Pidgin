 Monday, October 10th, 2011 8:44 pm - How can I get rid of an acne cyst fast? 
 
 xkirsteelouise Basically last week I got a horrible spot come up just under my eye, like the worst place it could be, but it&apos;s turned into one of them horrible acne cysts, n it&apos;s so red and big it&apos;s pretty much impossible to cover! I&apos;m too embarrassed to go to college because of it! What is the best thing I could use or do to make it heal like within the next couple of days, or even just make it go down a little or get rid of the redness so it&apos;s easier to cover and less noticable. I&apos;ve heard cortisone injections are the best but sadly they don&apos;t do them where I live :( I&apos;ve tried the hot compress trick, hydrocortisone cream and calamine lotion, none of it is working very well. 

Talking from experience what is the best product or home remedy to get rid of this horrible thing? Even advice on how to cover it up so it&apos;s barely noticeable would be a great help, I&apos;ve got really good concealer but even that isn&apos;t working :/

I don&apos;t have really bad acne, I&apos;d say I&apos;m mild to moderate, but it really affects my self esteem, I&apos;ve been on erythomycin for a while, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be working anymore :( 4 scars | pick.. pick.. pick.. 
 Thursday, July 14th, 2011 12:27 pm - Lemon juice vs Vitamin E oil for red marks. The showdown! 
 
 dismorphicfeb Okay guys. I&apos;ve read that lemon juice and vitamin E oil are good at fading red hiperpigmentation marks left over from spots. But which one is better?
Well, I&apos;m going to do a little experiment. I&apos;ll be using lemon juice on one of my red marks and vitamin E on the other. It&apos;ll probably take about a month to see results but I&apos;ll keep you updated and we&apos;ll find out which one is the winner!

 11:24 am - A thankyou 
 
 dismorphicfeb Thanks to everyone who posted to my message and answered questions for me, I really appreciate it.
At the moment, I am using non-comedomic skin products and I&apos;m washing with Garnier deep pore cream wash for sensitive skin(used it before and it seems to keep the spots at bay) and I also use Simple soap at night. I stopped using a scrub after some woman on the Clinque counter told me they spread bacteria was she wrong?)
Anyway, my skin is behaving itself relatively okay at the moment, I&apos;m on Diantette birth control, this might be it, but too soon to tell.
I&apos;ll stay on this for 6 months and if that doesn&apos;t work, it&apos;s maybe best to try Spironolactone.

Thanks guys! 8 scars | pick.. pick.. pick.. 
 Monday, July 11th, 2011 11:29 am - Worried, stressed and at my wits end 
 
 dismorphicfeb Hey everyone. I&apos;ve just joined Live Journal to try and get some support over my acne problems.
In all honesty, I have mild acne but it&apos;s destroying my self-esteem and ruining my relationships. I actually broke up with my boyfriend over it because I was so convinced I looked hideous and I just couldn&apos;t cope with him seeing me without makeup in the morning when i stayed over.
Thankfully, we are back together (he took me back because he knows how depressed i am right now)
I&apos;ve been on anti-depressants and am in councelling for my low-self esteeem. I&apos;m also currently on the contreceptive pill Dianette but am only on day 6. I&apos;m also using Retin-A, but only at the lowest strength.

I have some questions to ask you guys and I really hope you&apos;ll get back to me as my acne is making me want to die sometimes(I&apos;m sorry for being so extreme-but it&apos;s the truth)

1. Has anyone else been on Dianette? Or Dianette-35? Did it work for you and how long did you take it?
2. I have red scar marks on my face from previous acne. Should I get a chemical peel? Will it work? What type etc?
3. I smoke. It&apos;s terrible I know. Would this make my skin worse? I&apos;m worried that if I stop my skin will get more oily and so...more spots
4. Lastly, how do you deal with the low-self esteem associated with acne?


Thanks guys
