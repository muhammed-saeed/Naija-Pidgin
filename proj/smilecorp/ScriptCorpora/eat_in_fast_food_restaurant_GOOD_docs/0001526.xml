What is the difference between the high end supermarts and the mass market supermarts?
 Shared with Safeway , Coles , Cold Storage and NTUC Fairprice 
 Dear Officer 
 I can&apos;t help but notice how presentable the products are placed in this supermart in Singapore. The staff takes the time and effort to ensure each product looks presentable; in this case all product labels facing towards the customer. 
 I hope you would take this into consideration in alignment with service excellence as your company&apos;s direction.  
 For your kind consideration.
