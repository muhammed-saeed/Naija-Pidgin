Restaurant Description
 (five-0-three) reflects the spirit of Oregon; the terrain, the farms, local ranches, artisan cheese makers and wineries. Each step in the path from harvest, through the kitchen, to the dining table contributes to the integrity of our ingredients. You&apos;ll experience new takes on classic foods, all with exceptional balance and flavor.

Relax in one of the overstuffed booths that surround the contemporary, open design. Walls of glass, a stunning slate rock wall and custom artwork all add to the ambiance. The focal point of the restaurant is the large open kitchen with an inviting chef&apos;s counter. (five-0-three) features a full bar with a beautiful arched window backdrop to bring the outdoors in. Reserve your special occasion or business meeting in our 12 person private room. From May through October take advantage of our large patio for dining and drinks. The service staff is friendly, knowledgeable and well trained.
