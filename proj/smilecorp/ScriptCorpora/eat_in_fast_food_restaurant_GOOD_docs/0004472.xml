Chick Fil A on Route 17 in Fredericksburg, VA
 Celebrate Virginia Parkway, Fredericksburg, VA 22406

 TRUSTWORTHY 
 Chick Fil-A is a chain of fast food restaurants known for its courteous staff and delicious (though somewhat overpriced) chicken sandwiches. The Chick Fil-A located on Celebrate Virginia Parkway in Fredericksburg Virginia does not disappoint. This particular location seems to do any special, sale, or promotion that any Chick Fil-A does (rather than opt out of some events, like many do), and often community events and special guests for children are hosted right in the restaurant. The food is consistently hot and fresh, and as Chick Fil-A is known for, the service is always great.

I have eaten at this particular restaurant at all different times of the day. During breakfast time, they tend to be especially busy, but I have never had to wait longer than about five or ten minutes for my food. Since I usually take my food to go, the staff always offers to let me sit and to bring my bag over when it is ready. Likewise, at lunch time, I have never had a long wait. The one time somebody got my food wrong, the person at the register was quick to apologize and just as quick to replace it with the right thing. Even late at night the staff is friendly. When I went there for a very late dinner after a long work day, they offered me a free sample of their peppermint milkshake, then brought out almost a full cup of it for me to try. It seems like everyone there is genuinely interested in making sure every customer has a good day.

The food is just as good as the service at this particular location. The chicken is never fatty, and the waffle fries are always crispy and hot, rather than soggy as fries left out too long can be. I have never had any trouble with flat soda or over-sweetened lemonade. And even the ice cream is always good, never gritty or sour like ice cream from a dirty machine can be. Thankfully, they are always well-stocked on the Chick Fil-A mustard-like sauce that I enjoy, as well as a large variety of other condiments.

This location is very clean, too. I don’t have to worry about sticky tables, food on the floors, or stained seats, as I would have to with other fast food places. The staff strives to keep the entire place clean, and they frequently go around offering to take trash or get refills for people eating in. This is a level of customer service that is unusual for a fast food restaurant.

I am happy to take friends and my family to this location on Celebrate Virginia. It is easily my favorite Chick Fil-A, and I have become a regular there. There is nothing that disappoints me there, other than the prices, which are consistent with every Chick Fil-A - more than I’d wanted to spend, but worth every penny.

 Chick-fil-A Chick-n-Strips Salad 
 The Chick-fil-A Chick-n-Strips Salad is easily my favorite of the Chick-fil-A salad offerings.

At least Chick-fil-A prepares these strips in peanut oil, so they are a little ...

 Chick-fil-A Chick-n-Strips 
 One of the reasons that I do not feel as guilty about eating chicken at Chick-fil-A is because they use refined peanut oil to cook their chicken products. That is definitely a healthier way to prepare fried chicken! The Chick-fil-A Chick-n-Strips are no exception, and they too are prepared ...
