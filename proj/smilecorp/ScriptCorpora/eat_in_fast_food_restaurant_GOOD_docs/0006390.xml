Steam Goes Metro

 rating: (39) Tweet 
Inspired by last week&apos;s BUILD conference, Chris Preston has created some mockups of what the Steam video game service could look like on Windows 8. And ... oh my. These are beautiful.

&quot;If Windows 8&apos;s new UI turns out to be even slightly successful then it is a safe bet that monitors and computers generally will come with touch built-in, and so while not useful for gaming itself, a metro style Steam client application may become a real possibility some years down the line,&quot; he writes . &quot;To that end, as an enthusiast of UI and UX I decided to experiment with the concept of a Steam Metro UI. Please note that these shots (especially of the store) are very early WIP mockups.&quot;

Check these out. But get a napkin first. There&apos;s going to be drool.
 

 

 
 
 But wait there&apos;s more. I guess the Steam forums have gone down today, but Chris has provided some more mockups:

Ironically, isn&apos;t Win8&apos;s built-in app store designed to make services like steam obsolete?

@mwheeler.

Your comoparison between tablets and cars is somewhat flawed. Ford&apos;s work. Italian car design is stunning, but they are soo unreliable. Your backhanded compliment is stunning. I am sure when typewriters came out you would have been the type that it was only a fad and demanded we all still use fountain pens.

Touch is a very natural interface, its a very easy interface to use. That is why it is really taking off in the mobile world - its quick and intuitive. Sometimes computer keyboard&apos;s just get in the way. Sure I can drive a rally car using cursor keys, but a steering wheel is just so much better. Your put down of social users is somewhat sad, being able to communicate with others around theh world in such the current fashion is something previous generations would be deeply envious of. Computers, the internet, touch tablets are not just for you and your fellow luddites, they are for everybody in every nation throughout the world.

Windows 8, as demonstrated on this site and elsewhere is both a touch and and a traditional keyboard/mouse interface. Don&apos;t worry you may catch on to this eventually.

So please don&apos;t let us stop you listening to your gramaphone, or perhaps lighting your gas lamps and putting on your riding boots before you saddle up your horse.

Oh and one final thing. The article has got nothing to do with touchscreens its about a video game service which could be utilised on a touch screen. RTFA before moaning.

&quot;Okay, you can attach a keyboard to your tablet. Excuse me, that&apos;s a laptop.&quot;

Or it&apos;s a dockable tablet with a desktop console - the most ideal computing platform.

&quot;Microsoft needs to give a lot of consideration to maintaining a Professional Windows version, and a fischer-price version for consumers.&quot;

Apple already does the latter.

&quot;The reason why touchscreens work in those environments is because the amount of time you are using the touchscreen is limited; cashiers spend most of the time scanning things and bagging things and only hit the touch screen towards the end.&quot;

Really? Ever eat out at a fast-food restaurant? Or check in to a hotel?

Brian,

Enough. There&apos;s no tablet here. It&apos;s just a screen. Windows 8 works very well with keyboard and mouse, not just with touch. These screens, and all other Windows 8 UIs, are designed very much for that.

Please. Get over it. This isn&apos;t a tablet.
