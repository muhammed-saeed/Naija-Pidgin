Some well-meaning vegans have chosen to ignore the fast-food and chain restaurant market because of its emphasis on animal flesh, but the bottom line is this: In order to convince meat-eaters to stop eating animals, vegetarian options must be convenient and available in the places where meat-eaters munch. There will never be vegan or vegetarian options at restaurant chains unless vegetarians and vegans support them. Some of us never thought that we&apos;d see the day when Burger King or Bennigan&apos;s offered veggie burgers, but now that they do, the millions of carnivores who eat there can see that choosing meatless meals is easy and tasty. This is a huge step in the right direction.

Almost every restaurant has at least one vegan dish available. By making educated choices and asking the server for assistance, dining out can be a delicious—and cruelty-free—experience! We put together this handy guide to help you navigate the chain restaurant world.

 Arby&apos;s offers a baked potato and a garden salad or side salad with Italian dressing. Finish it all off with an apple or cherry turnover.

 Backyard Burgers , a restaurant chain in the South and the Midwest , offers a delicious garden veggie sandwich.

Remember going to Baskin-Robbins when you were knee-high to a grasshopper? Awaken the kid in you by trying the chain&apos;s dairy-free and gelatin-free ices and sorbets, which are just as yummy and cooling as ice cream—without the pus and hormones.

A delicious vegetarian Boca burger and a fresh garden salad are your options at Bennigan&apos;s .

 Bruegger&apos;s Bagel Bakery has several breakfast and lunch options for vegans, including its blueberry, chocolate chip, cinnamon sugar, cranberry orange, pumpernickel, and rosemary olive oil bagels, which can be topped with fresh vegetables, Dijon mustard, or vegan hummus spread. Bruegger&apos;s also serves several vegetarian sandwiches, which can be made vegan by leaving off the cheese and dressing.

 Burger King&apos;s BK Veggie™—a flame-broiled vegetarian burger (contains dairy products)—has enjoyed continued success. Every time a customer sees &quot;BK Veggie™,&quot; it is a reminder that &quot;having it your way&quot; doesn&apos;t have to mean taking a bite out of Bessie.

The French fries, hash-brown nuggets, breadsticks, English muffins, and CrissCuts at Carl&apos;s Jr. are all vegan. In the restaurant, there is an all-you-can-eat salad bar that offers a variety of fresh vegetables and a three-bean salad that can be topped with fat-free Italian dressing.

The grilled portobello mushroom sandwich and Boca burger are vegan at Cheeburger Cheeburger , which can be found throughout the Midwest and the South and on the East Coast.

 Cheers offers a vegan veggie burger. Load it up with all the fixings for a filling meal.

 Chipotle offers a vegetarian fajita burrito, but be sure to order it with black beans—the pinto beans are cooked with bacon.

The pizza sauce and dough at Chuck E. Cheese , Little Caesars , and Papa John&apos;s are vegan, while Pizza Hut uses vegan sauce, and its Thin &apos;n Crispy and dessert crusts are vegan. By omitting the cheese and choosing your favorite vegetable toppings, you can easily make a delicious vegan pizza.

 Cici&apos;s Pizza is inexpensive and will deliver to your home. Just be sure to ask about the vegan status of each item on your pizza. Cici&apos;s also offers a pasta-and-salad buffet with many vegan options.

 jimmmmm commented: Jul 1, 2012 10:34 AM At taco bell you can replace that beef/chicken on any item with beans Alex commented: Jun 25, 2012 9:16 PM Your completely wrong about P.F.Chang&apos;s. Many of the seemingly vegan items on there menus are not vegan. All fo their sauces are not vegan, and even their sugar is not vegan. If you speak to the Chef&apos;s or a manager they will tell you that the only vegan items are the steamed Buddha&apos;s Feast, garlic snap peas, and garlic spinach. Hopie commented: Jun 21, 2012 9:51 AM Olive Garden is not on the list. For years I have eaten spaghetti marinara, minnestrone soup or pasta and eggplant, and salad. I haven&apos;t asked about source of fats, et al. I really thought these were okay, at least for a vegetarian. Any info? Taco Bell? commented: May 31, 2012 9:52 PM I thought that the beans at Taco Bell had lard in them??? Joe@StLouis commented: May 18, 2012 2:50 PM I just had my lunch at Red Robin Gourmet Burger. I was served a vegan boca burger with fries( the server promised me the fries was not in the same fryers as the other fried stuff that contains meat/fish or anything else)
