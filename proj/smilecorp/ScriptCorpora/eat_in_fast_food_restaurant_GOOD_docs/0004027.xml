 BurgerFuel 

 We find this fast-food experience a little too supersonic 19  Reviews 
 ©ITP Images 
From the branded classic Dodge parked outside to Johnny Cash barking fire and brimstone over the speaker system, everything about BurgerFuel screams US of A. But despite its distinct American theme, this burger chain originated in New Zealand and now makes its debut in the UA of E.

The emirates’ first BurgerFuel has plonked itself in a prime position on The Walk at JBR; its glass façade reveals a generously sized two-tier dining area with a chrome kitchen that looks as though it means business. We were greeted by a throng of bubbly staff who showed us to a table by the window and issued us with menus. No sooner had we taken our seats than our over-enthusiastic waiter was describing each and every burger in rapid succession. Fast food is all very well, but our BurgerFuel experience was moving rather too fast. 

We ordered the BF Monster (a hearty choice with multiple toppings) and the cheese-inspired Studnut Stilton, upon which our fast-talking friend hurried off without asking us how we’d like our burgers done. Now, call me old fashioned, but if I’m paying more for a burger than I would at McDonald’s, I’d like the option of having it cooked medium-rare. But this, apparently, isn’t the BurgerFuel way, and before we knew it (in little more than five minutes), our meal had been plopped down in front of us. In bags.

So here comes quibble number two: I may be eating at a burger joint, but I nevertheless want some semblance of a restaurant experience. I’m not in any rush (if I was, I’d order takeaway), so why serve my meal in a bag? Our cheerful waiter made the point that all of BurgerFuel’s packaging is 100 per cent recycled, but surely the restaurant would be doing a better service to the environment by forgoing paper bag, cardboard burger box and paper cup in favour of a plate and a glass? Carbon footprint aside, I’d certainly be a lot happier.

If the burgers were outstanding – if I could taste prime New Zealand beef in every bite – then all would be forgiven, but though the meat patty was competently cooked, it was ultimately bland. My BF Monster was saved only by its fresh and abundant toppings: melted cheddar, juicy mango, fresh avocado, beef bacon and rich slices of beetroot. I’ve always been suspicious of Antipodeans’ love of beetroot with their burgers, but I have to admit that the combination works.

The Studnut Stilton didn’t fare quite as well. The punch of the stilton was diluted by the avocado and relish, although the fresh-baked buns and fries made the meal lighter than your average burger experience. If it had been lighter on our wallet, we’d have had no complaints. As it stands, however, we expect bigger, better burgers for our buck.

Absolutely the worst burger I had in Dubai! The bun is dry and crumbly. The patty is tough and has a frozen quality to it. The size is way too big. They really need to understand real burgers. I do better burgers at home !

Some people have no taste! For all those that have said that GBK, Fuddruckers or Fat Burger are better....I am astounded!
Burger Fuel IS the BEST BURGER I have had in the WORLD. Although I must admit the Burger Fuel in New Zealand is a bit better than Dubai, they have done a great job relicating the burgers here! I love them and was so pleased to learn they are opening in Mirdif City Center just around the corner from me! They will definately give GBK a run for their money in that mall!!!!!!

Cant find a better burger in dubai. The meat is cooked to perfection, bun is well toasted,lettuce,tomatoes and cheese are flavorful. The fries are just crunchy enough not to taste bland. I guess Im writing this more because im stuck at work and would like to eat something. But the message is still the same - go eat here if you like burgers.

I&apos;ve been to this buger joint quite a few times, and i love their burgers (have tried most of them i think), and especially the spud fries with the special mayo.

After 15-20 visits I&apos;ve only had one bad experience due to the burger didn&apos;t contain the ingredients advertised, but that was a take-away order and the 3 other people i ate with was satisfied with their order.

I nothing all, give them a try. The staff are very friendly and helpfull :)

Went for a quick burger and a soda after a day on the beach and really enjoyed it. I can taste that the ingredients are healthy and I liked the coke served in (small) glass bottles.

I didn&apos;t get the usual fast food revenge (very unpleasant feeling in my stomach) I get when eating at places like McDonals, Burger King and Chili&apos;s.

The only thing I missed was a napkin dispenser on my table. Looking around, there were quite a few tables that didn&apos;t have one.

Other than that I was happy. The service was fast, friendly and the burger was good.

I disagree with the last review; I have been few times to this burger Joint; and asked about the burger cooking process; there isn’t any burgers pre-cooked and heated before serving it; it’s all cooked to order; the fact that is cooked well done is perfect because raw minced meat is not a Susi or Steak; it has fat in it and risky to eat medium;

certainly far better than GBK which actually turned into steak and pasta menu the last time I have been there instead of burger only (you can guess why!!!

the bun in burger fuel are healthier than any other in Dubai; and so is the ingredient of the burger.

I love the organic soft drinks they serve as well.

this far better than any other Burger in UAE

For a restaurant that specialises in burgers, I just ate the worst burger I&apos;ve ever had in Dubai. When asked how I&apos;d like it cooked, I replied &apos;medium rare&apos; to which I was told that I could only have it &apos;done or well done&apos; because apparently all the burgers are pre-cooked for a set amount of time in their &apos;chargrilling machine&apos; and are then heated up in a griddle pan when ordered. At that point, I should have just left. If you have a burger joint and your burgers aren&apos;t cooked to order from fresh, you&apos;re in the wrong business. When the burger arrived in the paper bag (ugh), the bottom half of the bun was already soaked in grease and fell apart when touched, but worst of all, the burger itself had the consistency and taste of a piece of leather. I certainly won&apos;t be back, GBK is lightyears ahead.

These are the best burgers I&apos;ve had in Dubai AND Australia. So glad my favourite burger joint from back home has made it&apos;s place on The Walk.

you can&apos;t go past a fuel burger - They&apos;re amazing!

And the Doofer - Genius!

Easily the best burgers I have had in the Middle East. Anyone comparing Burgerfuel to Burger House, Gourmet Burger Kitchen or Fuddrukers should probably stick to those temples of blandness. Try the Hot Rod with jalapenos for a burger with bite.

I&apos;ve been 5 times, and will keep going back.

I disagree with your verdict, friends and family of mine who have dined at Burger Fuel would rate this place the best burger fast food restaurant. The food is healthier than any of the other fast food places and the service was very good.

Menu is lacking Variety with respect to ingredients. Places like Gourmet Burger Kitchen or Burger House have concoctions such as Thai Tom Yum or MExican burger for people craving something different.

Fast food style was a put off with the quick service (zero customisation) and service in a paper bag! some sort of salad on the side would have given it a feel good factor.

There is nooooo Combo (fries and drink).

Milkshake was too big for me, but no choice for sizes.

there were flies buzzing around me and landing on the table. didn&apos;t spot a insect zapper.

Fuddrukers is a much better alternative for same price.. with unlimited salad, drink refils and customisation (toppings, patty cooking, patty sizes, and side of wedges or fries with every order)
