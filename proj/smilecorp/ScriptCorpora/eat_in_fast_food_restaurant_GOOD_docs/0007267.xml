 Send Yourself Roses 
 

 Kathleen Turner has out a new book, Send Yourself Roses. I haven&apos;t read the book nor perused it in bookstores or online but the ad in
the paper caught my eye.

 Send Yourself Roses is about Ms. Turner&apos;s thoughts on
her life, love and leading roles. It
might be a great book-I have no idea. I did love her in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;.
What I really liked about Send Yourself Roses was her title-what a
concept!

 Sometimes we wait for someone else to do something for
us-send us flowers, take us to dinner, buy us chocolates (and do we even NEED
these?).

 Between the Hallmark Card Company, the candy stores, and all
the mall ads, there seems to be a holiday happening about every other week. We
finished up the December holidays in grand fashion, by licking the bottom of
every warm artichoke dip container, only to be led kicking and screaming to the
Dorito chips and seven-layer dip for Super Bowl, and staring us right in the
face right now is Valentine&apos;s Day and Valentine&apos;s Weekend!!

 I won&apos;t even mention the need for food for Academy Awards
parties because as soon as those speeches wind down, here comes St. Patrick&apos;s
Day!! And don&apos;t even get me started on giant chocolate bunnies for Easter!

 We can fill our kitchens with every sugar-laden calorie known
to man (and woman) during these days. We can come up with every excuse that&apos;s
ever been invented: &quot;After the start of the New Year&quot; or &quot;Let me just get
through this Super Bowl party&quot; or &quot;As soon as the holidays are over, I&apos;m
getting serious about what&apos;s in my kitchen cabinets.&quot;

 The problem is the holidays are never over.

 There&apos;s always another one, lurking in the corners-right
behind Door Number One. It&apos;s ready to tempt us, to trick us, to taunt us. The
holidays were fun when we were kids. Now they just seem fattening!

 If we want to get rid of that excessive clutter gathering
around our middles, we have to be strong, invincible and woman (an Ode to Helen
Reddy) and say &quot;No, thank you. I&apos;d rather not have the double chocolate
Mile-High and Ready to Die piece of cake. I&apos;ll have the small bowl of fresh
blueberries. But could you please throw some rose petals on top for extra
flavor?&quot;

 So if your special someone has not sent you something
spectacular this Valentine&apos;s or if there is no someone special at this time TREAT YOURSELF because you&apos;re worth it.

 Just go for the roses instead of the rolled cannoli stuffed
with whipped crme!

 I&apos;d love to hear how you survived another holiday and what
steps you&apos;ve taken to declutter your kitchen of calories. Send me an email at boomer@theredteam.com . I&apos;ll be sharing
your responses in a future blog.

 Until then- I&apos;ll try
to stay out of the kitchen
