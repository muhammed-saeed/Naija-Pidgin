I eat here 2-3 times a week for lunch... Fast! Fresh! Cheap! Tasty!!  What more could you want... Yeah yeah, it&apos;s Taco Bell but it&apos;s good and relatively healthy for fast food!!! Ya know what I&apos;m sayin&apos; dog? ;)
Did I mention they are fast?? They run that busy drive through like a well oiled machine!!! Never takes long...
And in all the years I&apos;ve gone here, I think they messed up my order only once. Not bad...

Sometimes the food is not always good at taco bell, its not like other fast food places, they serve the food fast enough that they are sloppy and the taco is cold, how can that be right, my favorite is the soft taco and sometimes I eat the taco and its cold, I wonder why when they&apos;re suppose to taste the same, its unpredictable what you can get from taco bell, sometimes its bad, good or amazing, just depends on the mood they have

Good ol me got off work late. Drove to see someone who is dear to me, talked outside for hours while seating crisscross applesauce on top of my car in this cold winter night ( i was having an intense convo didn&apos;t even thought of seating inside the comfort of my car). Before I knew it, I&apos;m starving to death and shaking uncontrollably because stupid me forgot to stuff my face with food and dumb enough to brave the coldness of the night with only 2 layers of clothing.

Knowing everything in wonderful Freakmont closes by 10pm, my only options were:

1. BK - close to my house
2. Taco Bell - closer to my house
3. 7-11 - super closer to my house
4. My fridge - IN my house

Since I was not feeling 1 and 3, and I know nothing in option 4 is cook, I opted for Taco Bell!!!

I drive by this TB everyday but i never had imagine even in my wildest dreams that i would someday eat something here. Don&apos;t get me wrong, i&apos;m not a snob and definitely not picky. It&apos;s just that I heard a lot of terrible stories about it. It was my first time and it&apos;s going to be my LAST!

I got myself a piece of Chalupa. Took it out of the wrapper and first thing I noticed was it&apos;s too soggy. Peeked what&apos;s inside and there&apos;s barely ground beef in it. They robbed me of my meat! Oh well, what can you expect out of a fast food anyways. I shoved it down my throat in a very Jurassic way and finished it in 5mins. Blech! It&apos;s the most disgusting food I ever had. Serious talk.

20 minutes after my meal, I started feeling sick. Dashed to my bathroom and saw my Chalupa again. Yeah you know what that means. Not a pretty sight I tell you, then the headache kicked in.

Never will I ever buy from this fast food again!!!

Next day, I got myself a big BBQ&apos;d lamb! Now, that&apos;s a freakin meal.

Not a great Taco Bell. I&apos;ve stopped here a few times over the years as I&apos;ve commuted between 680 and 880. Cleanliness, service, food quality are all about average. I dropped in most recently to try the Doritos taco. Unsurprisingly, the Doritos didn&apos;t really add any new, cool dimension to the taco taste.

 7/18/2011 1 Check-in Here 
My experience here had been rather interesting, but an unforgettable one.

We had just hiked Mission Peak and we were hot, tired and hungry. We came here to eat and ended up hanging out for at least two hours, which they did not seem to mind.

I ended up &quot;checking-in&quot; on my iPhone and rather than putting the phone away immediately like I usually do, I left it out on my food tray. I had not touched it since I checked in.

I do not remember what I got but I am thinking I got two taco supremes and a lime-aid, which I wanted to try. The tacos were fantastic because it is my ideal comfort food. The lime-aid, however, was on the very sweet side. I do not drink soda, and I did not realize it would be so sweet, but it was good for what it was.

By the end of the night my iPhone was covered with napkins and my taco bell wrappers. I meant to make a mental reminder that my phone was underneath everything so I did not throw the phone away.

Guess what happened? I forgot and threw my phone away by accident.

After driving an hour or so to Daly City, it was then that I realize, I did not have my phone. We tried calling and looking for it but no avail. We had to think back of where I last saw my phone. We tried going on Yelp&apos;s app to find the Taco Bell we had just eaten at, but it did not show up because we had forgotten which street it was on. My friend saved the night by realizing she kept the receipt in her pocket.

We called Taco Bell and by this time it was about 8:30 pm. They were really busy and distracted; they did not know why we were calling but they knew something about throwing an iPhone away and wanting to dig through their trash.

At that time I was thinking I may never see my iPhone again. Sure, my iPhone was dying and now needed to be plugged in to work properly but I wanted a more... say, proper good-bye since it was sentimental to me as I got it as a birthday gift. I didn&apos;t want this to be the reason why I had to get another iPhone.

We had contemplated on driving back to the Taco Bell to see if I could dig through the trash and retrieve it. We also thought about letting it go and saying good-bye to the phone forever.

But I needed closure. I wanted to make sure that I at least tried to get my phone back before giving up, because that this would have always been in the back of my mind.

So we drove back.

When we got back to Fremont and once we drove up to the Taco Bell parking lot, my heart was racing. I immediately jumped out of the car and practically flew to the entrance.

When it was my turn to talk to the cashier, she called someone over and someone came out carrying something with paper over it. IT WAS MY IPHONE. They went through the trash and retrieved my phone for me! I was so ecstatic I wanted to hug them all. I think I may have had some tears, too.

I could not thank them enough. Thank you, Taco Bell staff members. Thank you so much for your time to dig the phone out of the trash for me when it meant completely nothing to any of you. I know whomever dug through the trash, could have easily left the phone in the trash or even stolen it, but they did not. I am forever grateful for everything they have done.

For those that say there are not any nice and honest people in this world, you are wrong, because there still are.

Just like the description of a &quot;two-star&quot;, I HAVE experienced better.

My first time coming here was through drive-thru, about 3 weeks back. (I&apos;ve delayed on a review until this nice Sunday night).  So I do my thing:  order my cheesy gorditas and all my fixins.  Usually when I order through drive-thru I tell them easy on the ice/no ice please.  This time around, it just happened to slip my mind.  After I stated my drink description and proceeded to the window, I thought &quot;dammit!&quot;

Upon arriving at the window I noticed that the worker was not smiling...and why would she? she&apos;s working the drive-thru at taco bell! (sarcasm) So right away I thought, &quot;ok she looks like she&apos;s about to give me hell if I asked her no ice on my drink&quot; But whatever, it&apos;s an easy task...one that takes no longer than 10 seconds.

She takes my debit card..processes it...hands it back...goes away for like a minute and a half...comes back with my food...goes away for another minute and comes back with my drink.  That&apos;s when I dropped the question:  &quot;excuse me, would you mind taking out the ice?&quot;  (I thought that was pretty polite and straight forward) She stares at me for a good second and says, &quot;You should&apos;ve told me back there *points at the drive-thru speaker*&quot;  I said, &quot;I know I forgot&quot;  She goes, &quot;Next time tell me back there&quot;

Then she dumps the ice and refills my drink.  I know I can&apos;t portray the same situation via internet text but DAMN, there was attitude from this worker chick!  All I asked was to do something so simple, not even in a mean way!  I understand that it was my bad for not addressing such an easy method for my drink earlier but no one is perfect and we all make mistakes...just like this taco bell has made a mistake hiring short-tempered workers!  I&apos;m just being real.  And the result of me being real is that they get a bad rating.

I know most may be saying, &quot;well it&apos;s a fast food chain, they put up with so much bullsh!t from every other customer so don&apos;t go expecting &apos;high end&apos; services&quot;.  Well if you&apos;re thinking of that statement or somewhere along the lines..that&apos;s what makes the world more stupider each day! I know damn well I don&apos;t expect &quot;high end&quot; service but damn, I can expect DECENT, WELL-MANNERED service.  I&apos;ve worked at a fast food restaurant for 4 years while I was in high school so I know what&apos;s up...in other words:  IT AIN&apos;T THAT SERIOUS, GET IT TOGETHER!

I came to this Taco Bell, after going to the Fedex location in the same mall. It is a freestanding location in the mall.  Nearby are in the same mall are several fast food restaurants but Taco Bell is the most lowest cost and filling of the choices.

For my snack, I go the bean burrito and a small ice tea.  The ice tea is self-serve and refillable - a great way to solve a thirst on a hot day.  Service was quick and friendly.  Just like the other Taco Bell&apos;s, the taco is basically the same tasty and filling one.  Price was inexpensive for the drink and burrito.

When in the area again, and needing a snack, I would return.

I ordered the Nachos Supreme and yea, I understand it&apos;s just fast food, but it was probably the best damn Nachos Supreme I&apos;ve ever had at a Taco Bell in the Bay Area.  The interior of this Taco Bell was nice and clean compared to the more ghetto ones that are in SF.  You can actually sit in there and relax and enjoy your food.  The staff that my friends and I encountered during our time here gave us excellent service.  Nothing but positives for this place!

BEST TACO BELL IN FREMONT!

They remodeled it about 2 years ago, and it&apos;s clean, staff is friendly, and food is pretty fresh tasting considering that taco bell uses dog food grade meat.

Not bad! Good job on renovation and keeping up the good work! I don&apos;t like any other Taco Bell in the world because it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to this one.

They are fast, and have a good drive thru service.

For Mom: A chicken soft taco or a a light taco.
For 12+: I recommend the grilled &apos;stuft&apos; chicken burrito. It has everything you could possibly want, it fills you up, and it satisfies the protein and fat requirements of big hungry dudes.

Sources: Hungry Dude.

Snack on!

If you got to get Mexican fast food and you want the best going in as taste is concern. Then this is the place to get it. But eat at your own risk. Never felt healthy after eating fast food no matter how it taste. This place is convenient for beginning road trips or whatever. Nothing worse then eating food that gets you sick. Judge the people and the places upkeep, your health depends on it. So far, always been one of my choices of taco bells to go to. And I only found 2 worthy to mention. (also the one off of Stevens Creek)

In the Jack In The Box vs Taco Bell battle of late night eats we went with Taco Bell.  What a great decision that was as we &quot;unwillfully&quot; encountered their other Drive-Thru Diet - the one where we get home and discover that there&apos;s less food in the bag than we ordered so that we end up eating less.  Some Taco Bell worker is probably stuffing his face right now with my delicious $2.49 beef grilled stuffed burrito.  That&apos;d be an interesting way to end up with free dinner at the end of the night, pack one less item every once in awhile.  Next time, I won&apos;t be too lazy to count the number of items in the bag before setting it down.

I&apos;ve been coming to this location for the past ten years and although the employees come and go, there is a general sense of better food preparation than other Taco Bells that I&apos;ve visited. The remodeling a couple years ago really brings a positive vibe to the place. If the bathrooms were better kept, this location would get a better five star rating.

Like with any fast food location, be very precise and clear when you order your food. The fast pace of the business is a recipe for them (or anyone for that matter) to accidentally mess up your order... like putting onions in your burrito when even a small bite would land you in the emergency room.

I&apos;m kidding about the onions, but the point still stands. Be vigilant!
