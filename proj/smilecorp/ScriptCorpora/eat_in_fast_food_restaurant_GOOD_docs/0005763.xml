 Carl’s Jr. changing fries, again 

October 13th, 2010, 9:13 am· ·posted by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 
Old natural cut fries out at Carl&apos;s Jr. Thinner fries coming soon, according to fast-food chain.
 
Remember last year when Andrew Puzder , chief executive of Carl’s Jr. parent company CKE Restaurants, told me that most customers loved the chain’s natural-cut fries?

In fact, the exact quote was that customer reaction was “overwhelmingly positive”for the thick skin-on fries.

Apparently Puzder has rethought the Natural-Cut Fries ,  first introduced in mid-2008.

A reader alerted me when he spotted‘skinny’old-school fries being served at a Carl’s Jr. in Tustin.  I asked company spokeswoman Beth Mansfield to explain.

Here’s what she said:

“Natural Cut (skin-on) Shoestring fries are being introduced system wide at Carl’s Jr., replacing the thicker cut Natural Cut Fries,”she said.

She did not respond when I asked her if the thick-cut fries were being scrapped due to poor sales.

Why else would they be changed?
 
 5 p.m. update: Carl’s Jr. spokeswoman Beth Mansfield sent me this statement about the reason for changing the fries:”Carl’s Jr. still has Natural Cut Fries but we changed the size of the cut to shoestring. With rising commodity prices, this allows us to still offer our guests a great tasting natural-cut fry without an increase in the price.”
 
 Tell us: What do you think? Are you relieved that Carl’s Jr. is changing its fries, again? Have you tasted them in your local restaurant? Write in the comments section below and let us know.
