She lost her home, her car and her life

KALAMAZOO -- She was very private. She died in public.

She was found curled up beside the north steps of the Kalamazoo County Courthouse on the morning of Oct. 23. Sometime during the rainy night, when the temperature dipped to the low 40s, she sought the modest shelter of a marble wall, and it was there life left her.

There was no evidence of foul play, and an official cause of death has yet to be determined. It&apos;s almost as though she just laid down and went to sleep.

&quot;It&apos;s sobering. We as human beings don&apos;t want to see that happen to anybody,&quot; said the Kalamazoo County sheriff&apos;s deputy who found her body.

She carried no identification, so for a few days her identity was unknown.
But as the pieces of her life begin to come together and the fog lifts on her anonymity, it&apos;s clear Barbara H. Davis, 58, was a woman with a life and a family.

At one point, she was a young bride, a graduate of Michigan State University, a woman who had a pension and a home and a car.

But she also was a woman who had faced tragedy, kept to herself and struggled silently for the last few years even as she lost nearly everything she had. She never asked for help; never let her family know the difficulty she was in.

What kept Davis from contacting her family? From saving her home? From seeking help that might have saved her?

Her family will never know.

 Who was Barbara Davis? 
Gregory Rokicak walks into the basement of his home near Sturgis, just north of Klinger Lake, where he and his sister used to go sailing.

There, he opens several photo albums he found in her trailer, where he went after he learned of her death.

Most of the photos are from the mid-1980s, capturing Davis in her mid-30s, an attractive, tall, thin woman full of life with a brilliant smile, bright, friendly eyes and long brown hair.
 Photo courtesy Gregory Rokicak Barbara Davis, seated, is surrounded by family in a photo from years ago. From left is her brother, Thomas Rokicak, father Rocky Rokicak, mother Phyllis and brother Gregory Rokicak. 
One shows Davis in a purple dress drenched in bright sunshine. Another is Davis with a friend standing by a food buffet. Yet another is of her at a friend&apos;s graduation party.

There are no photos of Davis during the past several years.

She grew up in Gibraltar, where she graduated from high school. She had two brothers, Thomas Rokicak, of Hampton, Va., and Gregory Rokicak.

Her husband was killed in a car accident in 1972, just after she graduated from MSU, Gregory Rokicak said.

&quot;She was never the same after that. They had just bought a house in Lansing and were going to start their life together. She was a young girl in her mid-20s then. She was just devastated,&quot; he said.

She never remarried and had no children.

She made her home in Kalamazoo for almost 20 years, Gregory Rokicak said, and for years worked for temporary agencies as a health-care aide.

Despite the image painted by her death, Gregory Rokicak would like to leave people with other images of his sister.

Smart. Resourceful. Independent. A wonderful artist and writer. A traveler. A woman who went to the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969.

There are happy memories, Gregory Rokicak said. &quot;It breaks your heart. She deserved better.&quot;

 From home to homeless 
All that remains on the lot at 3625 Swift Drive in the Meadow View Village Mobile Home Park on Kalamazoo&apos;s west side where Davis lived for most of the past 15 years is a worn concrete foundation and a weathered, white tool shed.

About three years ago, she moved to a mobile home park in Oshtemo, but moved back to Meadow View because she wanted to be closer to downtown Kalamazoo, where she enjoyed spending time, Gregory Rokicak said.

He said that when he visited Davis at her trailer about a year ago, she seemed &quot;a little off of it.&quot;

&quot;She&apos;s always been a little silly, a little crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;Could she have been schizophrenic? Maybe.&quot;

But he also says she was never diagnosed with any illness.

He invited his sister to his daughter&apos;s wedding in June, but Davis wrote a letter back saying that she didn&apos;t feel up for it.

&quot;I&apos;m just getting too old to go to formal events anymore,&quot; the note reads. &quot;I used to live for them, but not anymore.&quot;

Since her death, Gregory Rokicak learned Davis was living off a retirement account, but had no other money and likely would never have looked for a job.

A woman named Kathleen, who asked that her last name not be used, lived next to Davis in the mobile home park.

She remembers Davis as a thin, meek woman with long, white hair who rarely came out of her home, hardly ever went grocery shopping and who seemed trapped by something that kept her from interacting with the everyday world.

&quot;I thought she was in her late 70s or early 80s,&quot; Kathleen said. &quot;She looked like a strong gust of wind would just blow her over.&quot;

Kathleen took Davis some leftovers from her family&apos;s Christmas dinner last year.
&quot;I felt so sorry for her,&quot; Kathleen said. &quot;When I found out she passed away, I cried.&quot;

Another of Davis&apos; neighbors, Candice Jones, felt sorry for her and was concerned about her mental health.

Sometimes Davis would bathe herself outdoors with water that collected in a plastic snow sled behind her trailer, Jones said.

She remembers Davis would pace around her trailer, sometimes talking to herself and her two cats. As her money troubles apparently mounted, Davis stopped feeding them cat food, giving them corn instead. Eventually, the cats didn&apos;t get fed at all.

&quot;I felt bad for her,&quot; Jones said. &quot;She just seemed like a loner. I tried to give her food, but she wouldn&apos;t take it.&quot;

The mobile home, which she owned, was taken away this past spring when she fell behind on her lot and utility payments, her neighbors said.

That&apos;s when her 1992, four-door Chevrolet Cavalier became home for her and her two love birds, which had been her pets for years.
 Merissa Ferguson/Gazette A cane made by her father and other items filled the back of the car in which she lived during the summer. When it was impounded, she began wandering the streets and staying nights at the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission. 
 Living on wheels 
Davis apparently spent the summer living in her car, Gregory said, sleeping in parking lots around Kalamazoo with her birds, her trunk and back seat stuffed with all the possessions she could tote, including a Michigan State University pennant.

She may have slept sitting up, since the belongings in the back seat probably prevented the seat from reclining.

Gregory Rokicak wishes she would have called. Their mother died of Alzheimer&apos;s in August, but he was never able to get in touch with her to tell her. She could have stayed with him, he said.

It is impossible to say what was going through Davis&apos; mind the past few months, Gregory Rokicak said, whether it was pride or shame or something else.

After losing so much, she needed help but didn&apos;t ask for any.

Then her car was gone.

It was towed Oct. 5 from the parking lot of a downtown fast-food restaurant at the request of management after she apparently left the property. Her birds were sent to the Kalamazoo Humane Society, where they&apos;ll be adopted out.

She became homeless on the streets of Kalamazoo.

Her brother says he easily could have helped get her car back and given her financial assistance to get her back on her feet. He wishes he could have sensed her troubles.

&quot;If I&apos;m blaming anyone, I&apos;m blaming myself,&quot; Gregory said. &quot;I think her pride took over. She was going down financially and she didn&apos;t want me, my brother or daughter to know.&quot;

Sometime after her car was towed, Davis sought refuge at the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission, where she went by the alias &quot;Shirley James,&quot; Gregory Rokicak said.

But on the night of Oct. 22, just 17 days after losing her car, she didn&apos;t check in at the shelter.

Her resting place that night became the courthouse grounds, where she closed her eyes for the last time. She was found the next morning. The precise cause of her death is unknown pending a final report.

Several homeless people interviewed had never heard of Davis or had just heard rumors about her as she didn&apos;t seem to talk much with others who call the shelter home.

&quot;When you first become homeless, there&apos;s a lot of shame,&quot; said Ian Valenzuela, a homeless Kalamazoo man. &quot;You don&apos;t want to be seen, you don&apos;t want anyone to know that you&apos;re homeless. You want to become invisible.&quot;

All that remains
His sister&apos;s car now sits outside Gregory Rokicak&apos;s home in Sturgis, at the end of his long, leaf-strewn driveway. A receipt from the towing company shows he paid $262, including $152 in storage charges, to claim it on Oct. 29.

Upon opening the passenger doors, a heavy, musty smell flows from the car.

The cabin is like a time capsule: Floor mats, blankets, baseball caps and plastic grocery bags, along with oddly random items, such as wooden paint stirrers, are crammed in the back seat.

Up front, old newspapers are crumpled between the seats. Cigarette ashes litter the ashtray. Bird seed is scattered on the floorboards and small, white feathers from her precious love birds dance on the passenger seat as a breeze blows through the open car.

&quot;She might have been penniless, but she wasn&apos;t possession-less,&quot; Gregory said, looking at his sister&apos;s things. &quot;She didn&apos;t want us in her affairs, but now I&apos;m surrounded by her affairs.&quot;
