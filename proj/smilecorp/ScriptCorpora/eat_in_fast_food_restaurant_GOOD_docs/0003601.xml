 January 14, 2011 Fatburger (Elkridge) By Bill Hensley&apos;s Random Blog I like cheeseburgers! A lot. I have heard that Fatburger is good, and at dinner last night, noticed that there was a Fatburger in the same area, so four of us went there for lunch today... Full review

 July 7, 2012 Chick-fil-A Shining Customer Service by Imblest11 ( 1 review ) I could not believe the service we got here when we went. It&apos;s a fast food joint and yet the workers were not only fast and accurate with our order during a very busy time (we couldn&apos;t even find a parking spot it was so busy), but they are a shining example of what customer service should be. Twice we had employees come to our table to make sure the food tasted okay and ask if we needed refills on our drinks. Not only that, we had someone give us a nice sized sample of their new ice cream treat. When my husband decided to get in line to buy one of these ice creams, I sent him up with my cup to get me a second refill of drink (after an employee had already gotten me one once before.) That same employee walked up to him who was standing in line and offered to get the refill for me and brought it straight to my table (she remembered that he was associated with me and brought it straight to me even though he was still in line). Another employee then came to the table next to us and took... more» I could not believe the service we got here when we went.

That same employee walked up to him who was standing in line and offered to get the refill for me and brought it straight to my table (she remembered that he was associated with me and brought it straight to me even though he was still in line). Another employee then came to the table next to us and took their tray of trash to dispose of it. This same table had a child that had gotten a kids meal and already had the toy that came in her box, so the employee went to the back to get her a toy that she hadn&apos;t gotten before. The smile on that child&apos;s face was priceless! Everybody was very polite and helpful. I had such a good experience here, if I didn&apos;t live so far away (we were travelling from Washington DC back home to Pennsylvania) I would go there quite often to show my support. I have to admit, I am a little bit of a snob when it comes to service at restaurants, and their service was sooo good there that I would honestly say it was better than most sit down restaurants with trained servers. Their service would rival that of some higher end ones too! I&apos;m not sure what other Chick Fil A&apos;s are like because we don&apos;t really have them around where I live, but I have been to them before. But this place is actually quite shocking. They made me feel like they actually appreciated me and my business rather than just seeing me as number like every other fast food chain. All of this, and they don&apos;t even get tips for it! I HIGHLY recommend this place! They definitely stand out amongst the crowd of fast food chains. July 3, 2012 The Bullpen Mobile review by income ( 1 review ) today was my 1st time visiting and the staff was friendly and the food is the best I will be coming here more often June 24, 2012 Breezy Point Seafood Compnay Worst Experience by Grandma416 ( 1 review ) What a rip-off!!! I had a $25 Restaurant.com certificate where I had to purchase $35 AND dine in. This place is no more than a fresh seafood counter with some tables. There wasn&apos;t a clean table in the place, the floor was dirty, and it smelled so fishy, it made your nose burn. We ordered 2 crab cake entrees with fries and cole slaw, a bowl of crab soup and a bowl of cream of crab soup. We wanted the crab dip, but they were out. The crab cakes were good, but very little seasoning. Both soups were terrible. The Maryland crab tasted like a bowl of pepper soup. The crab meat was shreadded and there wasn&apos;t any flavor of crab, just hot pepper. The cream of crab had some lumps of crab but there again, tasted more like pepper soup and was very thin. Our biggest complaint was the service. The guy who took our order at the counter came out of the back when we walked in, but we had to decide what we wanted to eat.

Our biggest complaint was the service. The guy who took our order at the counter came out of the back when we walked in, but we had to decide what we wanted to eat. He went back into the back and it took yelling and ringing their bell for about 5 minutes to get him to come back out front. He had a really lousy attitude and no personality. After we ordered and went to pay, he added 18% gratuity to our charge. I realize the certificate says 18% would be added on, but there was no service. Lots of full serve, caring about waiting on their customers restaurants have that on their certificate, but most of them don&apos;t apply it to the check, and we usually tip more than the 18%. The only service we received was our food carried out to our table. They do the same thing at McDonald&apos;s if you have to wait and don&apos;t charge for a tip. He could have just as easily waived this 18% when we objected, but he was a real jerk!! For our 18%, we had our food carried out of the back and put on the table. We had to get our own pre-packaged plasticware with one salt and pepper packet in each, I picked up extra napkins, and we ended up drinking our soda out of the bottle because we have no idea how long the two dirty styrofoam cups had been sitting on the table by the plasticware basket. It seems their main business is carry-out and I really understand why. We feel totally ripped-off by the lack of service, the so-so food, the dirty dining area, and the guys attitude through the whole process. Even the cole slaw was already pre-packaged in a plastic container instead of in a dish. I would not recommend to ANYONE they eat at this place. Our total for two crab cakes, 2 bowls of soup, 2 bottles of Pepsi, and the 18% gratuity before the $25 certiciate was over $46!!! We have used many Restaurant.com certificates and gladly paid more than the posted 18% gratuity, but I feel we deserve our 18% gratuity back since there was no service involved. This is just a way for this fish house (I won&apos;t even call it a restaurant) makes money on Restaurant.com customers.
