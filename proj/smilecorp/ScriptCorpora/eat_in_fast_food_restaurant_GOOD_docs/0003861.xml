 Wendy&apos;s New Salads: A Healthy Choice or Fresh Marketing? 
 Posted on Jul 13th 2010 3:00PM by Kristen Seymour Filed Under: Diet&amp;Weight Loss Email This 
 Wendy&apos;s 
 Wendy&apos;s has figured out what many of us have known all along: Fast food isn&apos;t just handy for the burger and fries crowd. People who like fresh, crisp salads sometimes need a quick meal, too.

The fast food chain best known for square hamburger patties and the Frosty is promoting a new line of affordable Garden Sensations Salads (suggested price: $5.99, but that will vary by region), boasting fresh, tasty ingredients you&apos;d expect to see in a more upscale establishment. But, as we all know, fresh and fancy doesn&apos;t always equal healthful and diet -friendly, so we dug a little deeper to see what these new menu items are really offering.

There are four new salads: Apple Pecan Chicken Salad , Baja Salad , Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad and BLT Cobb Salad . With all the fixings, they range from 580 calories and 27g of fat for the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad to 740 calories and 49g of fat for the Spicy Chicken Caesar Salads -- not exactly the lightest option, especially when you consider that you can get a Jr. Cheeseburger and small French Fries and keep it to 600 calories. (You can see all the nutrition information for these salads and other meals here. )

However, as we said, those numbers are with all the fixings, including dressing, cheeses, nuts and other &quot;crunchies&quot; (like croutons and tortilla strips). And that means you have a little more control over what you&apos;re consuming than these figures might lead you to believe.

&quot;We&apos;re putting the dressing and the &apos;crunchies&apos; in separate packets, so if you&apos;re looking for &apos;watch-outs,&apos; you can really make the calories work for you or against you,&quot; said Denny Lynch, SVP Communications of Wendy&apos;s International. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t take the shaved asiago cheese off myself, but these parts are under your control.&quot;

Over all, Lynch said that Wendy&apos;s believes these salads are a positive step. &quot;Each salad has vegetables and protein, and can have fruits and nuts. You can get one to two cups of vegetables in your meal, depending on which salad you choose,&quot; he said. And for those opting for a healthy lifestyle, choosing a few hundred calories containing a couple servings of healthy stuff rather than an equal number of calories made up of fried foods is a good way to go.

Who exactly are they targeting with these new choices? &quot;Well, we would love to tempt the hamburger and fries crowd,&quot; Lynch said, &quot;but we&apos;re really targeting the salad lovers and the foodies who truly enjoy quality ingredients.&quot; Wendy&apos;s is making a big promise regarding freshness, saying all ingredients will be harvested and in stores within three days -- something made easier by the fact that the vast majority of the ingredients in these salads will be grown in the United States.

While these new salads might not take the place of the homemade salads we bring to work when we&apos;re counting calories, we do like the fact that a fast food restaurant is focusing on fresh, real ingredients, and making it easier for the consumer to cut down on the calories, fat and sodium by automatically putting the dressing and other toppings on the side.

Plus, any of these choices are a heck of a lot better than any of these 10 fatty fast food offenders !

The new spicy chicken caesar is nasty! It&apos;s fried, it&apos;s WAY to spicy (too much black pepper) and WAY too salty. the &apos;salad&apos; part of this is just a few tomatoes and some lettuce---PLUS it&apos;s almost $6!

Does anyone know which parts of the apple salad come in separate packages?

I would like to express my disappointment in your companies decision to discontinue the only FAT FREE SALAD DRESSING currently on your menu. It was very difficult for someone on a low fat diet to visit your restaurants and have just one dressing (the french) to choose from in the first place. You have always needed at least two to choose from and now there are none.
I am now going to search out your competitors to see what they have available. Because of my schedule I usually eat at Wendy&apos;s on an average of 4 to 5 times per week as I travel from city to city in my area and Wendy&apos;s has been my Fast Food Restaurant Of Choice for several years. I will now be taking my business else where.
It would be nice to hear from a company representative about this.
Thank You,
Karl Wassmuth

You cannot imagine our disappointment when we reached our local Wendy&apos;s restaurant about a week ago and found that our favorite salad--the Mandarin Chicken Salad--was no longer available. We have usually visited a Wendy&apos;s at least twice a month to have this salad. What we had--the BLT Cobb was certainly not a substitute. So long Wendy&apos;s.

You got it!!!! I LOVED the Mandrin Chix Salad and was EXTREEEEMLY disappointed! Now what to order. I decided on the Baja salad.....and there isn&apos;t even Chix in it:( Guess I won&apos;t be visiting Wendy&apos;s for a LONG time now!!!

I, too, was disappointed when my husband and I stopped in at Wendy&apos;s today and the mandarin chicken salad was gone. I had the Baja salad, which was good, but was astonished when I later read that it has 550 calories and 33 gms of fat. I can&apos;t imagine how they came up with that since it&apos;s mostly lettuce with a bit of cheese and a small scoop of chili. Must be the guacamole. Adios, Wendy&apos;s salads.

I too was a big fan of the mandarin chicken salad. Try a half-sized Apple Pecan Chicken Salad (Skip the dressing packet) and you should have a pretty tasty, low sodium meal. That is all I ever get when I go there (which is quite frequent, being a lazy bachelor :)). I also have a fairly sensitive stomach, and have never had an issue with this meal.

We are very disappointed at our office. We ate the BLT salad frequently, often getting 4 salads in one trip. The Honey-Mustard dressing was outstanding, there were cherry tomatos, not little chunks of tomato, the cucumbers are gone and the salad is smaller in general. Then there is the price of $5.99! That was a huge jump, which impacts the ordering. We are not impressed with the flavor of the new salad and as mentioned by another customer, we will be looking elsewhere for our salads.

I agree 100%! The Chicken BLT Salad Wendy&apos;s used to have was outstanding.... whole tomatoes, whole cucumber, lots of salad greens, perfectly cooked white meat chicken, and that amazing honey mustard dressing! I have not been back to Wendy&apos;s ONCE since I found out they got rid of this salad. The &apos;replacement&apos; salads are horrible - tiny little chunks of tomatoes, disgusting dressing&amp;even the chicken isn&apos;t as good. Apparently they&apos;ve lost a lot of business over replacing those salads. I sincerely hope Wendy&apos;s reads these comments&amp;brings out salads back!!
PS: if anyone knows a copycat recipe for that honey mustard dressing, PLEASE email me @ never_mind_84@hotmail.com! Thanks! :)

Yesterday, Sunday, we had the chicken/apple/pecan - it was wonderful, but a little pricey. We had the $1.00 off coupon. Very filling and very tasty with the pomegranate vinegarette dressing. The thing that impressed me was it wasn&apos;t full of iceberg lettuce - just great mixed greens.

Wow...I have eaten the Apple/Pecan salad for dinner in the last 4 days. Yummy and filling. All the while thinking it was a better choice than a burger and fries. I&apos;m just going to have to drink more water and eat less calories during the day, so I can still enjoy this delicious salad


 
 Pattie 7-31-2010 @ 12:41AM 
 
Just stopped at one of your stores for a Baja salad after working 13 hours...only to get home and find nothing but lettuce and a few shreds of sheese in the bowl...thinking maybe you put the good stuff on the bottom ..I dug deep ...you got there it was ..I hit the jackpot...I found a nickle at the bottom of the bowl....$6.47 for lettece?? I could have bought my own head of lettuce and actually enjoyed it....Try to call the store and how convenient...NOONE answers the phone.Back in the morning to deal with the manager...probably best ..I was a tad pissed to get home and not be able to eat my salad....

Have to say totally disappointed in the new BLT salad, it&apos;s not horrible...but it&apos;s just OK...I was looking forward to the BLT salad with honey-mustard dressing, croutons, etc...bummer!

I was sooo disappointed that Wendy&apos;s discontinued their Chicken BLT Salad! It was the best salad, and their new salads cannot hold a candle to it! (When it&apos;s not broke, why do you feel the need to fix it?) Please bring it back - with the low-cal, low sugar honey-mustard dressing! Until you do, I will be eating elsewhere.

Four Fresh New Salads. Yes they are new. I believe the contents are fresh. Disappointed, YES. Bring back the old selection of salads. They were far superior. Presently I am trying to eat a Baja Salad for my lunch. Not impressed. My husband just tried to eat your Spicy Ceasar. Much too spicy for him. It is a shame that what used to be a good deal with the previous salads has turned to something that is barely palatable and overpriced.

I tried the Apple Pecan Chicken this last week and I LOVED it ! I love the Marzetti Pomegranate vinaigrette.... looked for it in the store, but couldn&apos;t find it.... The only problem is that the nearest Wendy&apos;s is over 40 miles from where I live ! ;-( Looks like I will have to make more out of town shopping trips so I can get this new salad !!!

I love the new Apple/Chicken/Pecan salad, but imagine my dismay when I realized it is &quot;off the chart&quot; on the Weight Watchers point calculator!!! 580 Calories is not great, but the 27 Fat grams blows it totally out of the water!!! Wendys, how about some salad selections that taste great and will fit the WW plan!!

I saw the advertising for the new Salads but was surprised and disappointed when I tried to order the old Salads to find they were discontinued. I regularly enjoyed the Taco Salad and Chicken Salad but they&apos;re no longer available. The Baja is similar to the Taco Salad (now includes Guacamole and pico de gallo) but I&apos;m not a fan of Guacamole or Onions in my salad so I have them omitted. The result is the same salad costs me ~$1.40 more (with tax).

Wendy&apos;s could have added the new Salad&apos;s as an option without removing the existing Salad&apos;s. bad Move ! What were they thinking?

Wendy&apos;s was my fast food restaurant of choice but I will be looking for a better option.
