 The term &quot;chips&quot; 

Speakers of American English differ from speakers of some other Englishes in their use of the word &quot;chips&quot;.

Despite the differences in terminology, the combination of strips of potato-flesh served hot with fish still has the name &quot;fish and chips&quot; in most U. S. restaurants which serve the dish. But a few U. S. restaurants will offer &quot;crisps&quot; instead of &quot;fries&quot; when a consumer orders &quot;fish and chips&quot;. [3] [4] 

 

 History 
 Service counter in an Irish fish-and-chip shop 
In the United Kingdom, fish and chips became a cheap food popular among the working classes with the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea in the second half of the nineteenth century. Working class is a term used in academic Sociology and in ordinary conversation to describe depending on context and speaker those employed in specific fields or types Trawling is a method of Fishing that involves pulling a large Fishing net through the water behind one or more boats The North Sea is a marginal, Epeiric sea of the Atlantic Ocean on the European Continental shelf. [5] Before then, fishermen had used long lines to target only large, high-quality demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish, especially valuable sole . The demersal zone is the part of the Sea or Ocean (or deep Lake) comprising the Water column that is near to (and is significantly affected The soles are Flatfishes of various families Generally speaking they are the members of the family Soleidae, but outside Europe, the name &apos;sole&apos; is also Trawlers , on the other hand, landed a mixed catch of high-quality &quot;prime&quot; and cheaper &quot;offal&quot; fish, most of which fishermen initially threw back into the water due to the lack of a market. However, as railway charges fell, it became viable to transport this cheaper fish inland, and demersal fish became a mass-market commodity rather than a costly luxury. &amp;quotRailroad;&quot;and&amp;quotRailway;&quot;both redirect here For other uses see Railroad (disambiguation. 

Deep-fried &quot;chips&quot; (slices or pieces) of potato as a dish may have made their first appearance in Britain about the same period: the OED notes as its earliest usage of &quot;chips&quot; in this sense the mention in Dickens &apos; A Tale of Two Cities (published in 1859): &quot;Husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil&quot;. The Oxford English Dictionary ( OED) published by the Oxford University Press (OUP is a comprehensive Dictionary of the English A Tale of Two Cities (1859 is the second Historical novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the (Note that Belgian tradition, as recorded in a manuscript of 1781, dates the frying of potatoes carved into the shape of fish back at least as far as 1680. ) [6] 

The modern fish-and-chip shop (&quot;chippy&quot; in modern British slang) [7] originated in the United Kingdom, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. According to one story, fried-potato shops spreading south from Scotland merged with fried-fish shops spreading from southern England. Early fish-and-chip shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking- fat , heated by a coal fire. A cauldron or caldron (from Latin Caldarium, hot bath is a large Metal pot ( Kettle) for cooking and/or boiling Fats consist of a wide group of compounds that are generally soluble in organic solvents and largely insoluble in water Unsanitary by modern standards, such establishments also emitted a smell associated with frying, which led to the authorities classifying fish-and-chip supply as an &quot;offensive trade&quot;, a stigma retained until the interwar period . 2008 ( MMVIII) is the current year in accordance with the Gregorian calendar, a Leap year that started on Tuesday of the Common The industry overcame this reputation because during World War II fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing . World War II, or the Second World War, (often abbreviated WWII) was a global military conflict which involved a majority of the world&apos;s nations, including Rationing in the United Kingdom is the series of Food rationing policies put in place by the government of the United Kingdom during certain wartime periods of [8] 

 

 England

Deep-fried fish and deep-fried chips have appeared separately on menus for many years, though potatoes did not reach Europe until the 17th century.

The Portuguese people (os Portugueses literally the Portuguese) are the Ethnic group or Nation native to the country of Portugal, in the west is a classic Japanese dish of deep fried battered Vegetables or Seafood. )

The dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century ( Charles Dickens mentions a &quot;fried fish warehouse&quot; in Oliver Twist , first published in 1838) whilst in the north of England a trade in deep-fried &quot;chipped&quot; potatoes developed. London ( ˈlʌndən is the capital and largest urban area in the United Kingdom. South East England is one of the nine official Regions of England.

Lancashire is a non-metropolitan county of historic origin in the North West of England, bounded to the west by the Irish Sea [10] 




 

 Scotland 
 Main article: Scottish cuisine 
In common with the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland experienced a wave of immigration from Italy toward the end of the nineteenth century. Scottish cuisine is the specific set of cooking traditions and practices associated with Scotland. Many of the new Scots Italians set up friggitoria or gelateria businesses, catering for their own communities as well as for the native population. Italian Scots or Scots-Italians are an Ethnic minority of Italian descent living in Scotland. Such Italian traders in Scotland originally hawked their wares from carts selling mostly ice-cream, but with the abundance and wide availability of seafood in Scotland, fish and chip shops soon became common. The Dundee City Council claims that &quot;. Dundee (Dùn Dèagh is the fourth-largest city in Scotland and fully named as Dundee City, one of Scotland&apos;s 32 local government council . . in the 1870s, that glory of British gastronomy — the chip — was first sold by Belgian immigrant Edward De Gernier in the city’s Greenmarket. &quot; [11] Brattisani&apos;s in Edinburgh &apos;s Newington district promotes itself as the oldest operational chip shop in Scotland, having traded since 1889. Edinburgh ( ˈɛdɪnb(ərə Dùn Èideann) is the Capital of Scotland and is its second largest city after Glasgow. Newington is an area of Edinburgh, Scotland, about 15 to 20 minutes walk south of the city centre the Royal Mile and Princes Street. 

Originally situated only in the larger cities and ports, fish and chip shops have proliferated in Scotland. Many Scottish chip shops remain Italian-owned, with names such as Crolla&apos;s , L&apos;Alba d&apos;Oro , Brandeschi&apos;s and L&apos;Aquila Bianca .

Scotland made the transition to polystyrene containers later [12] than some places, and although polystyrene containers have become a common sight in Scottish fish-and-chip shops, some shops still sell the food with its traditional wrapping of paper. The traditional packaging involved an inner white-paper wrapping and an outer insulating layer of newspaper, though nowadays the use of newspaper has largely ceased on grounds of hygiene, with food-quality wrapping paper often used as a substitute. Year 2007 ( MMVII) was a Common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar in the 21st century. Authorities banned the use of actual newspaper in the 1970s. Polystyrene packing, usual in many other kinds of take-away outlet, then infiltrated the industry. Purists maintain that it &quot;doesn&apos;t taste the same&quot; in polystyrene or cardboard, as polystyrene cannot absorb any excess oil, vinegar or condensation coming off the hot food, possibly leaving the food less crisp.

Scots often call a portion of fish and chips a &quot;fish supper&quot;.

In Edinburgh a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water, known either simply as &quot;sauce&quot;, or more specifically as &quot;chippie sauce&quot;, has great popularity. Edinburgh ( ˈɛdɪnb(ərə Dùn Èideann) is the Capital of Scotland and is its second largest city after Glasgow. [13] Many Scottish comedians have made capital out of the difference in condiment choice between Glasgow and Edinburgh, with Glaswegians eating salt-and-vinegar, and Edinburghers preferring salt and sauce. Glasgow (ˈglæzgoʊ is the largest city in Scotland and third most populous in the United Kingdom

 Ireland 
 Main article: Irish cuisine 
Similarly to England and Scotland in the late 19th-century, Ireland experienced a wave of immigration from Italy after 1945. The Anstruther Fish Bar is an award winning fish and chip shop in Anstruther, a fishing village in the East Neuk of Fife, Scotland. Irish cuisine can be divided into two main categories–traditional mainly simple dishes and more modern dishes as served in restaurants and hotels Hence many of the chippers have &quot;Roma&quot; as part of their name (&quot;The Roma Grill&quot;, &quot;Roma Takeaway&quot;, etc. ), or &quot;Napoli&quot;. Famous Italian-Irish families include the Borza family, the Macari family and the Mizzoni family.

Most establishments in Ireland continue to serve fish and chips in paper-bags with greaseproof inner-lining bags. Consumers in Ireland normally eat chips with salt and vinegar. Since many of the Italian families didn&apos;t have a high standard of English when they first arrived in Ireland, it has become popular to order a &quot;one and one&quot; (originating from pointing at a menu and asking for &quot;one of those and one of those&quot;), in the Republic of Ireland, meaning &quot;a fish fillet and chips&quot;. A &quot;single and fish&quot; (often ordered in Dublin) or a &quot;fish supper&quot; (in Belfast) means the same.

The potato pie — a spoon of mashed potato (sometimes with chopped onion and/or cheese) deep-fried in batter — has become an Irish chipper favorite, notably in Cork. In Wexford, the same dish appears as a &quot;rissole&quot;. Some rissoles feature batter, but one can also find spicy rissoles — deep-fried in spicy breadcrumbs

 

 Folkways 

The long-standing Roman Catholic tradition of not eating meat other than fish on Fridays — especially during Lent — and of substituting fish for other types of meat on that day — continues to influence habits even in predominantly Protestant, semi- secular and secular societies. In modern English usage meat most often refers to Animal tissue used as food mostly Skeletal muscle and associated Fat, but it may also refer Friday (pronunciation ˈfraɪdeɪ ˈfraɪdi is the day of the Week falling between Thursday and Saturday. Lent, in some Christian denominations, is the forty-day-long liturgical season of fasting and prayer before Easter. Secularism is generally the assertion that governmental practices or institutions should exist separately from Religion or religious beliefs Friday night remains a traditional occasion for patronising fish-and-chip shops; and many cafeterias and similar establishments, while varying their menus on other days of the week, habitually offer fish and chips every Friday. InfosysElectronicCityCafeteriaJPG|thumb|250px|right|One of a number of cafeterias at Electronic City campus Infosys Technologies Ltd [14] 

Chips may have become associated with meals of fried fish because the fat used for frying the fish often became too hot for good frying. To return the fat to an optimal temperature, chefs dropped cut-up potatoes into the fat. Legend has it that shops initially gave the resultant &quot;chips&quot; away free with the fish.

 

 Culinary variations 

Regional differences exist in the United Kingdom for preparing the fish before battering. Some outlets, particularly those in the south of England, leave the skin on one or both sides of the fish, while others (mainly in the north of England, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland) fry a fillet with no skin at all.

 

 The operation of frying 
 Frying range 
Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard ; however, vegetable oils , such as peanut oil (used due to its relatively high smoke-point ) now predominate. Dripping, also known as beef or pork dripping, is an Animal fat produced from the fatty or otherwise unusable parts of Cow or Pig carcasses Lard is pig Fat in both its rendered and unrendered forms Lard was commonly used in many cuisines as a Cooking fat or Shortening Peanut oil ( arachis oil is an organic oil derived from Peanuts noted to have the slight aroma and taste of its parent Legume. The smoke point refers to the temperature at which a cooking fat or oil begins to break down Year 2007 ( MMVII) was a Common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar in the 21st century. A minority of vendors in the north of England and Scotland still use dripping or lard, as it imparts a different flavour to the dish, but it has the side-effect of making the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths. England is a Country which is part of the United Kingdom. Its inhabitants account for more than 83% of the total UK population whilst its mainland Lard continues in use in some other cases in the UK, especially in Living Industrial History Museums, such as the Black Country Living Museum . The Black Country Living Museum (formerly The Black Country Museum) is an open-air Museum of rebuilt historic buildings located in Dudley in the West 

In the UK, waste fat from fish and chip shops has become a useful source of biodiesel . Biodiesel refers to a non-petroleum-based Diesel fuel consisting of short chain Alkyl ( Methyl or ethyl) Esters made by [15] 

 

 The chips component of &quot;Fish and chips&quot; 

American-style &quot;french fries&quot; typically have a slimmer shape than their British counterpart chips; thicker &quot;fries&quot; sometimes appear on US menus as &quot;steak fries&quot;. Thicker slabs of potato result in a lower fat-content per portion than with &quot;French fries&quot;. Cooking-fat penetrates a relatively shallow depth into the potato during cooking, thus the surface-area reflects the fat-content proportionally. Thick chips have a smaller surface-area per unit weight than &quot;French fries&quot; and thus absorb less oil per weight of potato. Chips also require a somewhat longer cooking-time than fries.

 Lincolnshire White or Maris Piper potatoes produce good chips, although Belgians and Swedes tend to use the Bintje variety. Lincolnshire (abbreviated Lincs) is a county in the east of England. The potato is a Starchy Tuberous crop Vegetable from the perennial Solanum tuberosum of the Solanaceae Belgium has a population of about 10666866 citizens as of January 2008 &amp;quotSverige;&quot;redirects here For other uses see Sweden (disambiguation and Sverige (disambiguation. Most traditional fish and chip shops in the United Kingdom make their own chips from fresh potatoes. Most Australian chips (or &quot;hot chips&quot;) undergo pre-frying, then freezing before their final cooking.

 

 Batter and its variants 

The covering of the fish may also vary with bread-crumbs available alongside the traditional flour-based batter . Breadcrumbs or bread crumbs (regional variants breading crispies are small particles of dry Bread, which are used for Breading or crumbing foods topping Batter is a liquid mixture usually based on one or more Flours combined with liquids such as Water, Milk or Beer. In the United Kingdom batter comes as the standard coating, with breadcrumb-coated fish unavailable in many outlets.

Fish-and-chip suppliers in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland often include scraps of batter that fall into the fat and get fried (also known as batter , scratchins , scrumps , bits , scrobblings , gribblings , bits , fishbits , crimps , fishcrimps , crispy bits , or batters ) free on request. In the United States of America , some fish-and-chips aficionados refer to these as &quot;cracklin&apos;s&quot; (distinct from fried pork-rind cracklins ). The United States of America —commonly referred to as the Pork rind (known as pork scratchings in the United Kingdom, and pork crackle in Australia) is the skin of a Pig. 

UK chippies sometimes use beer -batter. Beer is the world&apos;s oldest and most widely consumed Alcoholic beverage and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea The carbon dioxide in the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter, and also an orange colour. Carbon dioxide ( Chemical formula:) is a Chemical compound composed of two Oxygen Atoms covalently bonded to a single A simple batter might consist of a 2 to 3 ratio of flour to beer by volume.

Originally consumers did not actually eat the batter. Instead, it served to encase the fish for steaming, then got discarded.

 

 Choice of fish 

In England, haddock and cod appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips, [16] but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other white fish , such as pollock or coley ; plaice ; skate ; and rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). The haddock or offshore hake is a marine Fish distributed on both sides of the North Atlantic.

The haddock or offshore hake is a marine Fish distributed on both sides of the North Atlantic. Indeed, in one part of West Yorkshire, the area between Bradford , Halifax and Keighley known as the &quot;Haddock Triangle&quot;, very few shops offer cod on their menu. Bradford ( lies at the heart of the City of Bradford, a Metropolitan borough of West Yorkshire, England. Halifax is a large Market town within the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, in West Yorkshire, England, with a population of 82056 in the Keighley ( IPA /ˈkiːθli/&amp;quotKeeth-ly;&quot;is a town and Civil parish within the Metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford in In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear most commonly in &quot;fish suppers&quot;.

Sharks ( Superorder Selachimorpha) are a type of Fish with a full cartilaginous Skeleton and a highly streamlined body Victorians tend to prefer flake, whereas Australians in more northern states generally favour reef fish. Increasing demand and the decline of shark stocks due to overfishing has seen flake become more expensive and — as in the United Kingdom — other white fish (such as barramundi ) will often replace it. Overfishing occurs when Fishing activities reduce fish stocks below an acceptable level Not to be confused with the Barramundi Cod or the Australian members of the genus Scleropages (which sometimes are referred to as Barramundis Australian fish-and-chip shops provide a wider range of fish (such as squid) than that commonly available in other countries.

Around North America&apos;s Great Lakes (especially in Detroit or Chicago ), as well as in New England , the popular tradition of Catholics eating fish on Fridays (especially during Lent ) has resulted in a codifying of a particular sort of &quot; fish fry &quot;, which includes a piece of whitefish (often haddock ), a plentiful amount of french fries (generally thicker-cut &quot;steak&quot; fries), potato-salad and/or macaroni-salad, and coleslaw.

 Fish-and-chip shops 

In the United Kingdom and in Australia fish-and-chips usually sell through independent restaurants and take-aways — colloquially known as chippies , chippers or chip shops in the United Kingdom, [18] or as fish-and-chip[s] shops in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Take-out (in North American English) carry-out (in US and Scottish English) take-away (in Australian English, Occasionally in these countries stores use the term &quot;Fish and Chippery&quot;. Outlets range from small affairs to chain restaurants. In the United Kingdom, punning names for the shops, such as &quot;The Batter Plaice &quot;, &quot;Assault and Battery&quot;, &quot;The Codfather&quot; or &quot;The Frying Scotsman&quot; often occur.

Fish-and-chip shops vary enormously in the United Kingdom: from small back-street affairs to posh &quot;Fish Restaurants&quot; with seating and with waiting-staff. The UK has a well-known chain called Harry Ramsden&apos;s , which originated in Guiseley near Leeds , and now has thirty-one chain restaurants throughout the country (the company also opened an ill-fated restaurant in Hong Kong and in Melbourne, Australia). Harry Ramsden&apos;s is a worldwide restaurant chain dedicated to traditional British -style Fish and chips. Guiseley is a small Town in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, England. Leeds ( is located on the River Aire in West Yorkshire, England British fish-and-chip shops sometimes sell other take-away food products, such as kebabs, pies, burgers, Chinese food and pizzas; more frequently the other items sold will involve deep-frying in the same way as with fish and chips, as the establishments often highlight the cooking method (some very traditional British fish-and-chip shops refer to their opening hours as &quot;frying times&quot;). In fishing-towns fish-and-chip shops also commonly sell uncooked fish . Fish are aquatic Vertebrate animals that are typically ectothermic (previously Cold-blooded) covered with scales, and equipped with two Some fishing-town chip shops also offer to fry customers&apos; own fresh fish, charging a fee dependent on the weight of the fish processed.

A side dish, sometimes referred to as a side order or simply a side, is a food item that accompanies the Entrée or Main course at a Meal ) In the 1990s, the perception within the United States of fish and chips as unhealthy led to a decline in consumption and to financial problems for Long John Silver&apos;s and Arthur Treacher&apos;s. Other restaurants have acquired these two brands, and the current growth-strategy of both of these chains appears to aim at combining fish-and-chips with other fast food brands to bolster them in the marketplace and to introduce new customers to the meal as a novelty. Year 2007 ( MMVII) was a Common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar in the 21st century. But some specialist restaurants prepare fish and chips in the full Commonwealth tradition — such as The Park Slope Chipshop in New York City. ChipShop NYC plans to spread around America by franchising. In Canada, Joey&apos;s Only Seafood Restaurants figure prominently in the fish-and-chips market with over 100 locations.

Fish and chip shops in the United Kingdom occur commonly near seaside resorts — where tourists and visitors commonly eat fish and chips as a &quot;traditional&quot; seaside meal — but also in both rural and urban settings, with most villages and towns having at least one shop, even in the absence of other fast-food establishments. A seaside resort is a Resort located on the Coast. Where a Beach is the primary focus for Tourists it may be called a beach resort

Popular culture (or pop culture) is the Culture — patterns of human activity and the symbolic structures that give such activities significance and importance — [22] 

 

 Packaging and wrapping 

In the UK most fish-and-chip shops offer a take-away service. They may supply the food either &quot;open&quot; — as individual servings for eating immediately — or &quot;wrapped&quot; — in a closed container or parcel for taking elsewhere. &quot;Open&quot; portions traditionally come in a greaseproof-paper (parchment) bag surrounded by an additional layer of folded paper so that one can hold it in one hand while eating. Britons still speak of a &quot;bag&quot; or &quot;poke&quot; of chips even when individual polystyrene or cardboard trays have replaced the bag. With &quot;open&quot; servings, the chippie usually puts a portion of chips in the bag first, with the fish and/or other accompaniments (such as mushy peas or curry sauce) placed on the top. The customer can usually take free salt and vinegar from the counter to add if wanted. Chippies usually offer disposable wooden or plastic forks for immediate use, although the traditional British way to eat fish and chips requires only fingers.

For &quot;wrapped&quot; servings, the chippie will either wrap the various components into a folded paper parcel or place them in a carrier with the accompaniments in individual containers, for plating up at home. Chippies usually ask customers whether they require salt and vinegar, then add them before wrapping the food.

Fish-and-chip shops traditionally wrapped their product in an inner layer of white paper (for hygiene) and an outer layer of newspaper or blank newsprint (for insulation and to absorb grease), though nowadays the use of newspaper has largely ceased on grounds of hygiene, and establishments often use food-quality wrapping paper instead — occasionally printed on the outside to emulate newspaper. A newspaper is a written Publication containing News, information and Advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called Newsprint. Newsprint is low-cost non-archival Paper most commonly used to print Newspapers plus other publications and advertising material Year 2007 ( MMVII) was a Common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar in the 21st century. In Northern Ireland, fish and chip meals once came wrapped solely with a couple of layers of newspaper, but concerns over ink-poisoning (especially relating to the use of lead type in newspaper-production) meant the phasing out of this practice. Characteristics Lead has a dull luster and is a dense, Ductile, very soft highly Printing-industry members, however, state that modern newspaper-inks to pose no such health risk. [23] Few chip shops now wrap the food in this way in Northern Ireland. Year 2007 ( MMVII) was a Common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar in the 21st century. 

The steam produced by fish and chips causes paper wrapping to emit a characteristic smell, and the close wrapping prevents evaporation, giving the food a moist texture which can last for some time if the parcel remains unopened. Polystyrene packing, usual in many other kinds of take-away outlet, sometimes appears. Polystyrene ˌpɒliˈstaɪriːn ( IUPAC Polyphenylethene is an aromatic Polymer made from the aromatic Monomer Styrene Even when the fish get wrapped in paper, an open polystyrene container often holds the chips. The United Kingdom banned the use of real newspaper in the late 1980s. Australian fish-and-chip shops, faced with a ban on the use of actual newspaper in the 1970s, substituted butcher&apos;s paper as the external wrapping, though a few shops continue to wrap their product in newspaper, especially in rural areas. Some shops in New Zealand still wrap their fish and chips in newspaper.

 

 Chip vans 

Mobile fish-and-chip shops serve rural areas in the United Kingdom, although they can also occur in urban areas — particularly working-class housing estates. Van-operators may favour beef dripping rather than oil for frying in that cold dripping forms a solid mass and will not slosh around when on the move. Such vans also roam Ireland, both north and south, generally trading outside rural nightclubs and at sports-stadia.

 

 Other dishes 

Fish-and-chip shops typically offer other hot fast food which customers may eat in place of the traditional battered fish. Fast food is the term given to food that can be prepared and served very quickly Typical alternatives offered by English &quot;chippies&quot; may include:

 Australia 

Australians favour a range of various accompaniments to fish and chips: such as the &quot;potato cake&quot; in Victoria , known as a &quot;potato scallop&quot; in Queensland and New South Wales or as a &quot;potato fritter&quot; in South Australia . Queensland is a state of Australia, occupying the north-eastern corner of the mainland continent South Australia is a state of Australia in the southern central part of the country Quite distinct from the sea- scallop , it consists of a thick slice of potato, deep-fried in batter.

 New Zealand 

New Zealand vendors offer an accompaniment identical to the Australian &quot;potato scallop&quot;, but known either as a &quot;fritter&quot; (as in South Australia), or as a &quot;flip&quot;. This leads to the dish &quot;flips and chips&quot;: historically a lower-cost alternative to &quot;fish and chips&quot;, but now sold for its own merits, rather than for reasons of economy. Year 2007 ( MMVII) was a Common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar in the 21st century. 

Distinctively kiwi items found in New Zealand fish-and-chip shops include paua patties (typically minced paua and batter), whitebait patties and muttonbirds .

According to Jo Gérard, our people already cooked chips prior to 1680. The historian offers as a proof a family manuscript dating from 1781 { Culinary curiosities in the Belgian Netherlands , signed by his great-great-uncle Joseph Gérard): &quot;The inhabitants of Namur, Huy and Dinant have the habit of fishing in the Meuse River, frying their catch, with a view to improving their staple diet (especially poor people). But when the watercourses freeze over and fishing becomes less reliable, the inhabitants cut up potatoes in the shape of small fish and fry those instead. I gather that this kind of procedure has already gone on for over a hundred years. &quot;
