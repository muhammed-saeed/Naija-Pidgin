 JUNE 2012 

 

 On June 1 at about 3:00 PM, 
 Officers Brinks and Fristed assisted Slinger PD with a traffic crash on 
 Highway 60 at U.S. 41.

At 9:19 PM, a 53 year old Chestnut Court man requested police assistance 
 for an out-of-control cat. When Officer Oswald arrived, the cat was just 
 sitting. The man said that the cat had been hissing, freaking out, and 
 tried to attack him.

On June 2 at about 3:00 AM, a Glen Hill Drive resident told Officer 
 Laabs that someone had driven across his front lawn. Officer Laabs 
 traced the offending vehicle to an apartment building across the street. 
 A few minutes later, the suspect started tossing lit firecrackers from 
 the front door of the building, and then retreated into his apartment. 
 Officer Laabs and Sgt. Herman from the Sheriffs Department knocked on 
 the apartment door, but the occupants wouldnt respond.

On June 3 at about 9:00 PM, an off-duty firefighter surprised a burglar 
 inside the Fire Department. The suspect ran north into the woods, and 
 the witness called 911. Officer Oswald drove behind Schmidt Funeral 
 Home, and two people walking their dogs pointed to the suspect. The 
 officer gave chase but lost the suspect. Officer Gerke arrived to assist 
 and was joined by several deputies, Warden Mitchell, and K9 Officer 
 Emmerich of the Cedarburg PD. K9 Jake alerted on a bicycle that was 
 found abandoned near a path that runs behind the fire station. Officers 
 Brinks and Fristed assisted with canvassing the area when they came on 
 duty. At about 7:00AM, a Jackson man reported that his bicycle had been 
 stolen from a parking lot overnight. The description matched the bicycle 
 that had been recovered. Other investigative leads resulted in the mans 
 arrest for burglary. He stated hed been looking for narcotic pain 
 killers, not realizing that these are not carried on the JFD ambulances.

At 3:00 AM, a Main Street resident reported a prowler because her dogs 
 were barking. Officer Borkowski found the womans 18 year old nephew, 
 who lives there, sleeping on the front lawn. See June 4.

On June 4 at 5:50PM, the Main Street resident came to the station 
 because she wanted to kick her sister and nephew out of the house. 
 However, she decided to give them until 7:00 PM and no assistance was 
 needed. See June 10.

On June 6 at 12:08AM, a Hemlock Street resident reported that a man was 
 standing outside, yelling at the sky. Officer Borkowski found a 64 year 
 old man who was experiencing some behavioral health issues.

On June 8 at 5:18PM, a Chestnut Court woman told Officer Henning that 
 someone entered her apartment and removed a bottle of Oxycodone at the 
 exact moment that she left her unlocked apartment to stand on the patio. 
 She needed a police report so she could get a replacement prescription.

On June 10 at 7:30 PM, the Main Street woman kicked her nephew out of 
 the house because he was using drugs, which he denied. He called police 
 because he needed a ride to Port Washington, but Officer Fristed 
 suggested that he find a friend to do that. See next.

At 9:43PM, the 18 year old told a girlfriend that he was thinking about 
 jumping off one of the radio towers on Highland Road. Officer Oswald and 
 Deputy Lake found the young man in the area of Ridgeway and Chestnut 
 Court. He said he was depressed because his aunt kicked him out of the 
 house for using drugs. He was so upset the previous day that he smoked a 
 bowl of marijuana but insisted that he hadnt used any today. ACS was 
 called and he was placed at Calm Harbor.

On June 11 at 11:33 PM, Officer Borkowski was dispatched to Ridgeway 
 Court for a disturbance. While still en route, a second call came in 
 that someone at the residence was carrying a concealed weapon. The 51 
 year old woman reported that when her daughter and the boyfriend came 
 home, her 31 year old son attacked the man for no reason and then ran 
 off. A neighbor heard the commotion, put a gun in his pocket, and came 
 over to help. The boyfriend didnt want to press charges because he and 
 the suspect were friends. If there was a reason for the attack, no one 
 was willing to reveal it. The man with the gun had a permit.

On June 14 at 9:03PM, Officer Henning stopped a van after it drove past 
 a stop sign and then crossed the center line of Industrial Drive. The 41 
 year old Main Street woman said she had two beers. However, she failed 
 field tests and was arrested for her 4th offense, with an enhancer 
 because a 10 year old was also in the vehicle. A 38 year old passenger, 
 with whom were familiar, called Officer Henning a criminal and had to 
 be restrained from trying to speak to the driver after shed been 
 arrested.

On June 15 at 9:13PM, Officer Henning and Deputy Herbst were dispatched 
 to a family trouble. The caller, a 22 year old man, said that he and the 
 mother of his child had separated, but he returned to the residence that 
 evening. He said that the woman called him a variety of profanities and 
 then slapped him; the red mark was still present. The woman claimed that 
 it was the man who called her many names (none suitable for re-telling 
 here) and she pushed him in the face. However, she was agitated and 
 started yelling, and was the one arrested.

On June 17 at 4:08PM, a deputy on Friess Lake Road in Richfield radioed 
 for help as he wrestled with a suspect he had Tasered. Officers Henning 
 and Oswald were asked to respond, but were called-off when other 
 deputies were able to clear from their own assignments.

On June 18 at 9:21PM, Officer Gerke stopped a vehicle on Hickory Lane 
 for expired registration. The 56 year old Main Street resident smelled 
 of intoxicants, and had slurred speech and glassy eyes. He refused to 
 perform field sobriety tests and was arrested for his 5th offense.

On June 20 at 7:44PM, Officer Oswald and Deputies Parkinson and Killey 
 were dispatched to a Parkview Drive home for a domestic disturbance. The 
 42 year old woman reported that her husband got angry because she saw a 
 doctor. He grabbed her by the hair and struck her in the head. He 
 continued to yank her hair while she was calling 911. The man was 
 arrested for Battery/DV.
  

 

 

 

 
   
 

 The&quot;Notable Incidents&quot;will resume 
 with the June reports. 

 

 MARCH 2012 

 On March 2 shortly before 7 PM, a Hemlock Street man told Officers 
 Henning and Oswald that an intoxicated woman had knocked on his 
 apartment door asking to use the bathroom. When last seen, the woman was 
 staggering away into the night during a heavy snowfall and a potential 
 winter storm. Officer Henning followed her footprints in the snow as 
 they weaved in and out of the apartment complexes along Hemlock Street, 
 and then hit a large field and disappeared. Officer Oswald located the 
 woman in front of an apartment building in the area. She was extremely 
 intoxicated and had difficulty forming coherent sentences but it seemed 
 that she was trying to find her boyfriend&apos;s house. When asked where that 
 was, she replied with a jumble of numbers and letters that were 
 indecipherable. She was unable to provide names and phone numbers of 
 anyone who could pick her up. Officer Henning went through the contact 
 list in her cell phone until he found someone who could take custody of 
 her; the alternative would&apos;ve been putting her in detox. For the entire 
 time they tried helping her, the woman was extremely belligerent and 
 claimed repeatedly that the officers were ruining her life and making 
 fun of her children. 

 On March 3 at approximately 2 AM, Officer Gerke monitored Slinger PD 
 being dispatched to a residence where an intruder had just been shot. 
 Slinger officers asked that she control the occupants of the garage next 
 door, where numerous juveniles had been involved in an underage drinking 
 party. For the next four hours, Officer Gerke dealt with a large group 
 of uncooperative young adults who, despite knowing that a friend of 
 theirs had been killed next door, displayed no remorse or human decency. 
 A 21-year-old Richfield man said,&quot;Cops can do whatever the f*** they 
 want to do and Its f***ing bulls*** that they couldn&apos;t leave. A 
 23-year-old from the Cedar Lake area said, Its f***ed up that some 
 ***hole got shot next-door and now we can&apos;t leave to get beer. When the 
 group was allowed to leave at about 5:45 AM, it was learned that others 
 had been hiding the entire time in an upstairs area of the garage. Five 
 more young adults came downstairs, all laughing and making jokes and 
 complaining about not having beer or running low on cigarettes. They 
 also knew that their friend had been killed. According to the Milwaukee 
 Journal Sentinel, some of them later posted Facebook messages protesting 
 the shooting or expressing grief for the victim. 

 At 1:50 PM, Officers Krueger and Fristed were dispatched to a Ridgeway 
 Court residence regarding an unruly 17-year-old. The grandmother said 
 she suspected the youth had stolen her OxyContin and searched his room 
 while he was in school. Her search, and the discovery that he&apos;d been 
 smoking cigarettes, provoked an argument during which he called her a 
 f***ing bitch. He was arrested and taken to the police station, where 
 he was cited for disorderly conduct. He was already under juvenile 
 supervision, and his social worker placed him in secure detention for 72 
 hours. 

 On March 6 at 6:14 PM, a Glen Hill Drive woman told Officer Oswald that 
 her 16-year-old son had left with a family vehicle after being told that 
 he wouldn&apos;t be allowed to drive it. While the officer was speaking to 
 her, the boy called Moms cell phone. When told that her decision 
 whether to report the vehicle as stolen would be based on his behavior, 
 he replied&quot;The cops can kiss my ass&quot;. He was located near the home and 
 wouldn&apos;t reveal the location of the vehicle until Officer Oswald 
 threatened to arrest him. 

 On March 7 at about 6 PM, Officer Henning arrested a 40-year-old 
 Germantown man at the request of Probation and Parole. Three years 
 earlier, we arrested the man for punching his girlfriend&apos;s nine-year-old 
 son. He violated parole by being in the girlfriend&apos;s Hemlock Street 
 apartment with the children. About an hour later, Officer Henning 
 returned to the apartment because the woman was making suicidal 
 comments. She told him that she was just very upset because her 
 boyfriend had been arrested. 

 At 7:38 PM Officers Henning and Borkowski were dispatched to a garage 
 fire at an Ash Drive residence. Officer Henning found the entire garage 
 engulfed in flames and there was fear that the fire would spread to the 
 attached home. Fortunately, strong winds were blowing in the opposite 
 direction, away from the house. Special Agent Michael Quick of the 
 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms assisted Officer Borkowski in 
 the investigation, but it&apos;s unknown why the 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix 
 started on fire. 

 On March 8 at about 6 PM, a Jackson Drive woman told Officer Henning 
 that her 17-year-old son is chronically disobedient and has been 
 spending time with a 16-year-old Eagle Drive youth. She learned that 
 when theyre at the other boys residence, they experiment with 
 marijuana and alcohol, and the torture technique known as&quot;water 
 boarding&quot;. Shes told the boys mother that she doesn&apos;t want them to 
 associate, but the other woman has not been cooperative. When 
 interviewed, that woman said the complainant was a liar; she doesn&apos;t 
 allow her son to smoke or drink; and would call the police if that 
 happened. Nevertheless, Officer Henning told her that she and her son 
 are not to have contact with the complainant&apos;s son and he&apos;s to be sent 
 home if he shows up at their door. A little while later, the complainant 
 reported that the two boys had run off in the area of Jackson Park when 
 her parents had tried to retrieve her son. Officer Henning attempted to 
 locate them without success. About an hour later, the grandfather 
 reported that he had almost been run over by a van containing the two 
 boys. Officer Henning stopped the vehicle on Hickory Lane at Jackson 
 Drive; it was being driven by the Eagle Drive woman. She told him that 
 she wanted to file a harassment complaint because she was being followed 
 by another vehicle; those were the grandparents. The woman said that she 
 had picked her son up and was trying to drive him home but the other 
 vehicle was following them. When asked, she said that the complainant&apos;s 
 son wasn&apos;t with her and she had not picked him up. The grandparents, 
 however, said they saw their grandson in the van as it arrived on Eagle 
 Drive. The van made a U-turn and drove out of the apartment complex at a 
 high rate of speed. They followed it to a dead-end and blocked its path 
 so they could speak with their grandson, but he jumped out and ran off. 
 Then the van drove off, almost striking him. Officer Henning than asked 
 the Eagle Drive woman about her statement that the boy wasn&apos;t with her. 
 She replied that she meant he wasn&apos;t with her at that time . When 
 asked if she picked the boy up, she tried to change the subject by 
 claiming the complainant was a bad mother, but eventually admitted 
 picking the boy up despite being told not to have contact with him. The 
 woman was warned for obstructing an officer; her son was warned for 
 disorderly conduct for yelling at the grandparents; and the grandparents 
 were warned for blocking the street. At about 8 PM, the complainant 
 called 911 to report that her son had returned home and was making 
 suicidal statements. When he arrived, the boy was on some stairs and his 
 mother and grandparents were on either side, trying to calm him down. 
 Instead of coming downstairs to speak with Officer Henning, the boy 
 started to walk up the stairs. When the grandfather tried to grab at 
 him, the boy lost his balance and hit his head. He told Officer Henning 
 that he really wasn&apos;t having suicidal thoughts; he just didn&apos;t want to 
 live at his mother&apos;s house. 

 On March 10 at 12:40 PM, a Green Valley woman told Officer Fristed that 
 she was having trouble with her mother-in-law. The complainant&apos;s husband 
 is estranged from his mother and stepfather, and the four people have 
 been feuding since last summer. Last fall, the older woman was cited 
 after she admitted making an obscene gesture at the complainant. Last 
 month, the older man was accused of making an obscene gesture at the 
 complainant&apos;s children (his step-grandchildren), which he denied. The 
 woman told Officer Fristed that her mother-in-law made an obscene 
 gesture again while driving past their trailer. When interviewed, the 
 older woman denied making the gesture. 

 On March 14, a 74-year-old woman told Detective Foeger that she had 
 lost almost $3,000 in a confidence scheme. This was a familiar scenario 
 in which someone claiming to be her grandchild called, told a sob story, 
 and convinced her to wire money. 

 On March 17 at about 6 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to Francis 
 Drive regarding a man who was yelling and swearing. A homeowner reported 
 that a man had been walking through his backyard. When his wife asked 
 what he was doing there, he cordially replied,&quot;None of your God damned 
 business&quot;. The man continued walking through numerous backyards and 
 close to people&apos;s homes, and then returned to the backyard near the 
 complainant&apos;s home. Officer Henning spoke to the 63-year-old Brookfield 
 man, who said that his six-year-old grandson took off on a bicycle and 
 the only way he could catch up to him was by going through the 
 backyards. He denied swearing at anybody but did admit to telling 
 neighbors to&quot;mind their own business&quot;. Several neighbors told Officer 
 Henning that the initial incident had provoked a&quot;yelling and swearing 
 match&quot;between the first couple and Grandpa that could be heard a block 
 away. The older man was warned for trespassing and disorderly conduct. 
 The complainant&apos;s wife was cautioned to calm down or she would be 
 arrested immediately. 

 On March 18 at about 8 PM, a 17-year-old woman told Officers Henning 
 and Borkowski that she had been sexually assaulted the previous night by 
 an 18-year-old West Bend man in her home. Subsequently, there was an 
 extensive follow-up investigation by the two officers, including 
 gathering physical evidence; accompanying the victim to the hospital; 
 and interviewing the victim, the suspect, and others who were at the 
 residence. The report was forwarded to the District Attorney for review. 

 On March 21, Detective Foeger assisted two agents of the Wisconsin 
 Department of Revenue as they seized a small amount of cash from a local 
 business and ordered it closed due to the suspension of its sellers 
 permit. 

 Shortly before 11 PM, Officer Oswald was on his way home when he 
 observed a man with an eye patch pulling a woman by the arm on Main at 
 Jackson. He pulled over and identified himself as a police officer. The 
 man explained that the woman was intoxicated and he was trying to get 
 her home safely. Shes a 40-year-old Georgetown Drive woman who we are 
 familiar with and who becomes argumentative when intoxicated. Officer 
 Oswald recognized the man as her boyfriend, and the woman said she was 
 comfortable going home with him. Although she was obviously intoxicated, 
 she assured Officer Oswald that she hadn&apos;t been drinking lately and, 
 although she had cut down considerably on her drinking, she wanted 
 Boyfriend to take her to the Jackson Pub sometime. 

 At about 11:14 PM, Officer Laabs was dispatched to an Eagle Drive 
 residence where a 29-year-old woman was screaming and out of control. 
 Upon arrival, the intoxicated woman was found outside carrying a 
 shopping bag and intending to walk to Slinger. Due to the woman&apos;s 
 condition, Officer Laabs requested a second car; Officer Cashin from 
 Slinger was dispatched. Relatives said that the woman had come home 
 after an evening of drinking and an argument ensued. She is also bipolar 
 and on medication. She was taken to St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital for medical 
 clearance and to meet with an ACS worker. Officer Laabs remained at the 
 hospital for two hours until the woman was finally cleared and the ACS 
 worker took her to Calm Harbor. 

 On March 22 a 51-year-old West Bend woman told Officer Oswald that she 
 was being followed by unknown persons. See March 26. 

 At 9:31 PM, Officers Oswald, Gerke and Borkowski were dispatched to a 
 Jackson Drive residence after a 46-year-old woman called 911 from a 
 neighbor&apos;s home to report that her husband attacked her. The woman 
 reported that her husband came home, intoxicated, and requested sex. 
 When she declined, he became agitated and began screaming and yelling, 
 throwing things around, and struck her in the legs with drawers that he 
 pulled out of the desk. He also put his hands around her neck and 
 squeezed, although he did not cut off her breathing or blood supply 
 (which would constitute&quot;strangulation&quot;under the law). The man then 
 drove off. At about 4 PM the following day, Officer Oswald observed the 
 man&apos;s vehicle parked in front of the residence. After Officer Cook from 
 Slinger PD arrived to assist, the man was taken into custody without 
 incident. 

 On the morning of March 26, the West Bend woman told Officer Friedl 
 that she was still being followed, and provided license plates of the 
 suspects. She was unable to provide any motive for someone to be 
 following her. See March 30. 

 On March 28, the Eastside Mart reported that it had video surveillance 
 of a truck being used in the theft of 30 bundles of firewood from in 
 front of their building. The license plate was visible and was traced to 
 a Town of Jackson man. Further investigation revealed that the man had a 
 suspended license and his wife was wanted on two warrants from Mequon 
 PD. That evening, Officer Fristed spotted the vehicle on Main Street and 
 followed it onto Highway 45. Officer Oswald and Officer Fristed stopped 
 the vehicle near Highway 145 and arrested the man for theft and driving 
 while suspended, and his wife on the warrants. 

 About 5 PM on March 29, Officers Oswald and Fristed were dispatched to 
 a S. Center Street apartment building, where a 22-year-old man 
 complained that his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his child, had struck 
 him and kicked a dent into his car. An argument started inside the 
 apartment and moved to the parking lot, where the woman placed their 
 four-year-old daughter in the car and then sat in the driver seat. The 
 man reached in, removed the ignition key, and walked away. The woman 
 allegedly came up behind him, struck him in the neck, and kicked the 
 rear bumper. There was a mark on the man&apos;s neck and a dent in the 
 bumper. The woman said that the man used his elbow to pin her against 
 her seat while he&quot;ripped&quot;the keys from the car. She claimed she struck 
 him very, very lightly and that he simply turns red very easily. She 
 claimed that the man got angry and began kicking and slapping at her 
 car, so she turned and kicked his car. The woman was arrested for 
 battery/domestic violence. 

 On March 30, the West Bend woman returned to the police station and 
 told Chief Dolnick that she was still being followed and provided more 
 license plates. As in the previous cases, the woman was not able to 
 provide any motive for being followed. All of the license plates she 
 provided were connected to residents of Jackson and surrounding areas, 
 with no apparent connection. Such behavior is considered&quot;eccentric&quot;and 
 as long as the woman doesn&apos;t confront any of her supposed stalkers no 
 further action can be taken. This, however, was the last time the woman 
 reported being followed. 

 

 February 

 On February 1 at about 9:14 PM, the Piggly Wiggly reported that a 
 teenager was possibly using drugs in the bathroom. Officer Henning spoke 
 to a 16-year-old West Bend youth who matched the description and was 
 standing in the checkout line with his mother. He noticed that the boy&apos;s 
 eyes were bloodshot and the pupils were dilated, and the smell of burnt 
 marijuana was wafting from his clothes. The boy seemed frozen and unable 
 to formulate a response to the officers questions. A search revealed a 
 plastic bag with marijuana and a case containing a marijuana pipe. He 
 was arrested and later released after citations were issued. 

 On February 3 at about noon, a cell phone caller reported a reckless 
 driver entering the village on Highway 60, and Officer Friedl 
 intercepted it in the area of Green Valley. The 44-year-old Town of 
 Trenton man immediately became argumentative to the point that Chief 
 Dolnick responded for backup. Although the man had never met Officer 
 Friedl, he said that,&quot;nobody likes the f***ing truck inspector&quot;and he 
 was&quot;some ex-State Patrol guy that did nothing but pick on trucks&quot;and 
 Everybody can&apos;t wait until you retire. The man owns a business in the 
 Town of Jackson, and has apparently heard the various rumors and 
 inflated stories about the motor carrier safety program. The man was 
 told that he might receive a citation depending on the statement 
 provided by the witness. During this time, the man continued to yell at 
 Officer Friedl about truck inspections, which had nothing to do with why 
 he was stopped. Although the witness later told Officer Friedl that the 
 man had been driving erratically all the way from Slinger, including 
 passing vehicles at high speed, he did not follow-through on a promise 
 to provide a witness statement and, consequently, the driver couldn&apos;t be 
 cited. 

 At 3:50 PM, a 27-year-old West Bend woman told Detective Foeger that 
 she had been in the hot tub with her husband at the YMCA in that city, 
 talking about how she needed a new tire for her car. A male subject, 
 later identified as a 44-year-old Town of Hartford man, overheard the 
 conversation and said that he had tires at his workplace; the woman gave 
 this man her phone number. The following week, the man called to say 
 that he found a tire that would fit her vehicle and arranged for her to 
 meet him at his Jackson workplace. That evening, she got into the man&apos;s 
 vehicle so they could drive to another persons residence to have the 
 tire mounted. On the way back to Jackson, the man referred to another 
 woman who used to give him massages while she was naked, and said that 
 while he never cheated on his wife it doesn&apos;t hurt a man to look. Once 
 in the village, the man went to his toolbox and retrieved a picture of a 
 nearly-naked woman wearing a see-through lace dress who he identified as 
 the aforementioned masseuse. The man declined payment for the tire and 
 his services, however implied that she could repay him by getting 
 naked. She told him that wasn&apos;t going to happen and left. The woman 
 wanted the suspect warned but did not want to pursue criminal charges. 
 When questioned by Detective Foeger, the man claimed that it was the 
 woman who offered sexual favors in exchange for his assistance; however 
 his claim has no credibility. The man was warned not to have any further 
 contact with the woman. 

 At 10:47 PM, an unidentified caller reported a fight in progress at a 
 16-unit condo complex on Blackberry Circle. As Officer Oswald and 
 Officer Gerke approached on foot, they could hear a man yelling 
 profanities. As they got closer, they saw the man, with a pit bull, 
 yelling about someone&quot;only making eleven f***ing dollars and dont know 
 s***. The officers announced their presence and had to tell the man 
 several times to put the dog inside the residence. The man and his 
 roommate/girlfriend were both evasive about the cause of the argument. 
 The intoxicated men kept trying to walk back to the residence despite 
 being told repeatedly to stay where he was. When told he was being 
 arrested for disorderly conduct, the man stepped away and had to be 
 restrained by both officers until handcuffed. 

 On February 5 at 3:38 AM, Officer Laabs stopped a pickup truck on 
 Sherman Road because the plates were suspended. The driver originally 
 identified himself as&quot;Robert Hoover&quot;, but got confused about his birth 
 date. When a driver&apos;s license check came back&quot;negative&quot;, the man 
 started shuffling through papers to remember his birthday. After a few 
 minutes of going back and forth with the man providing misinformation 
 and claiming that he did not have any ID, he was arrested and 
 handcuffed. While being arrested, the man said,&quot;Oh, yeah; you Jackson 
 cops like to beat people up&quot;. After several more minutes of bravado, the 
 man admitted to his real name and that he was both revoked and wanted on 
 warrants from our department. He proclaimed that he would&quot;sit on the 
 warrants&quot;for 11 days in jail rather than pay the bond. His female 
 companion had also been insisting that the driver&apos;s name was Hoover, 
 even though they had been acquainted for over a year. She was ultimately 
 arrested for obstructing an officer and, because she was already out on 
 bond for a felony, an additional charge of felony bail jumping was made. 
 It was later determined that the owner of the truck was a man named 
 Hoover who had been seeing the woman for some time. However, he refused 
 to file a complaint for the unauthorized use of his vehicle. 

 At 12:40 PM, a Dunbar Court woman complained that a neighbor had taken 
 her child&apos;s football, claiming that it belonged to his own children and 
 her son had taken it. It was ultimately determined by Officer Friedl 
 that the football actually belonged to the complainant&apos;s children. There 
 have been disputes between these households in the past, and both adults 
 were strongly encouraged to make peace. The neighbor felt badly about 
 what happened and returned to the caller&apos;s home with an apology and a 
 brand-new football. 

 At 6:50 PM, a passerby told Officer Fristed that an intoxicated man in 
 his 50s was stumbling down the sidewalk in the area of Hemlock and 
 Spruce. As the citizen walked over to provide assistance, the man walked 
 into a utility pole. He declined an offer of a ride to his house and 
 said he would be fine. The passerby went to get his coat and, by the 
 time he returned, the man was already gone. After an unsuccessful 
 search, the man called police. Officer Fristed also searched the area 
 but couldn&apos;t find him. 

 At 8:40 PM, Officer Oswald returned to Hemlock and Spruce regarding a 
 man in his 50s stumbling on the roadway. Upon arrival, another passerby 
 reported seeing the man walking south on Hemlock towards the apartment 
 buildings. He found the man leaning on a porch post in front of an 
 apartment building and, after seeing that the man had facial injuries 
 and was heavily intoxicated, called for Jackson Fire Rescue. Officer 
 Gerke arrived to assist, and the man was eventually identified as a 
 55-year-old resident of an adjacent apartment building. The man was 
 combative towards the EMTs and had to be restrained on a long board for 
 transport to the hospital. A field breath test was .30%. After medical 
 clearance and questioning by an ACS worker, the man was transported to 
 the Milwaukee site for in-patient detox. 

 On February 6 at 4:36 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department received numerous 
 911 calls regarding an erratic driver on southbound Highway 45 
 approaching Jackson. Follow-up calls indicated that the vehicle had 
 crossed over and was now southbound in the northbound lanes. Officer 
 Oswald discovered that the vehicle had crashed south of Western Avenue, 
 outside the village, and notified the Sheriff&apos;s Department. Three 
 vehicles sustained significant damage after either colliding with the 
 wrong-way driver or with each other. The suspect vehicle was in the 
 median, and the 28-year-old Lomira woman said that she had taken 
 Percocet at about 4 PM, got confused and entered the wrong way on the 
 freeway. She was turned over to deputies. 

 On February 7 at 1:45 AM, Officer Gerke was transporting a prisoner 
 from the county jail in Stevens Point to the Washington County Jail on a 
 Jackson warrant. While passing through Winnebago County, she and the 
 prisoner both noticed that a semi in front of them kept drifting from 
 the roadway onto the shoulder. After seeing this happened several times, 
 she called 911 and gave the information to Dispatch. Until deputies 
 intercepted them, she saw the semi continue to deviate from its lane. 
 After talking to the driver, a deputy told her that the driver was not 
 impaired, however he was driving from Minnesota and they were not 
 familiar with the regulations on driving hours. Coincidentally, Officer 
 Gerke is in the process of becoming certified as a federal-level Motor 
 Carrier Safety Inspector. She examined the driver&apos;s logbook and found 
 that he was over his hours by only half an hour and was close to his 
 destination Oshkosh. She provided a written statement about her 
 observations and the driver was cited for unsafe lane deviation. 

 At 1 PM, Officer Oswald met Officer Winslow of the West Bend Police 
 Department at a Stonehedge Drive residence, where a 16-year-old was 
 arrested after drugs were found in his locker at the West Bend High 
 Schools. 

 At 9:20 PM, Officer Garro from Slinger PD requested mutual aid for a 
 disturbance at DeCristos Restaurant; Officer Gerke responded. 

 At 10:20 PM, Officer Gerke searched a female prisoner for Officer 
 Forsythe of the Slinger PD. 

 On February 9, shortly after 9 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to 
 the Piggly Wiggly regarding a physical confrontation between the 
 customer and the cashier. The 17-year-old employee said that she opened 
 up a new lane and pointed to the second person in the adjacent line to 
 move over. The first customer in line, a 50-year-old resident, was upset 
 that she wasn&apos;t called to the new lane and allegedly pushed the employee 
 in the shoulder, causing her to stumble. The employee said that she told 
 the customer not to touch her, and when she walked away to help her own 
 customer, the woman continued to make a scene and called her numerous 
 profanities. Her version was corroborated by another employee. The 
 customer had already left and was interviewed by Officer Krueger the 
 next day. She said that the situation had not been as serious as 
 described, and that it was the clerk who was being rude and obnoxious. 
 She told the clerk&quot;not to act like a bitch&quot;only after the clerk had 
 yelled at her. Store management believed that the version told by its 
 employees was not accurate and asked that no further action be taken. 

 On February 13 at 8:36 PM, Officer Oswald was dispatched to a local 
 factory, where a 26-year-old female employee said that a fellow worker 
 accused her of throwing parts at him and was argumentative. Later, she 
 walked past him to punch out for the day and, after brushing his arm, he 
 allegedly pushed her and threatened to&quot;beat your head&quot;. This was 
 corroborated by other employees. The man had been fired and was now 
 sitting outside in a vehicle, and she didn&apos;t feel safe leaving the 
 factory. The 21-year-old Milwaukee man insisted that the woman was 
 throwing parts across the floor and striking him. When she walked past 
 him in the break room, she purposely struck him with her elbow, so he 
 pushed her away. He said that he was quitting the job because he 
 couldn&apos;t get along with his coworkers. However, the factory manager, who 
 is also the suspect&apos;s grandmother, confirmed that she had fired her 
 grandson. Neither subject wanted to press charges. 

 On February 15 at about 10 AM, a coworker of a 53-year-old Green Valley 
 man told Officer Fristed that his friend, who is never late for work, 
 had not shown up and was not answering his phone. The man&apos;s vehicle was 
 still in the driveway; all of the shades were drawn; and the man did not 
 answer the door. Detective Foeger and Chief Dolnick responded to assist. 
 After exhausting alternatives, entry was made through the backdoor by 
 breaking a small window with a hammer and unlocking the deadbolt. The 
 man was found on the couch, laying on his back. The physical signs 
 indicated that he had passed away overnight while watching television. 

 At 1:15 PM, Officer Krueger met a County social worker at Jackson 
 Elementary School after an eight-year-old boy claimed he had been 
 attacked by his 10-year-old sister. He said that while watching TV, his 
 sister wanted to watch something else and started to fight with him, 
 grabbed and scratched him. It&apos;s unusual for cases of this kind to be 
 handled with a social worker and the police, but there were other issues 
 in the home that made a more formal follow-up necessary. Ultimately, no 
 further action was taken. 

 On February 17 at 1:30 AM, Officers Gerke and Borkowski were dispatched 
 to a Wilshire Drive residence, along with Jackson Fire Rescue, regarding 
 a 28-year-old man who had cut his wrists. An ACS worker determined that 
 there were grounds for an emergency detention. The man readily 
 acknowledged that he needed assistance and was willing to commit himself 
 voluntarily; however the ACS worker was unable to locate a facility that 
 would accept him voluntarily because of insurance issues. So, Officer 
 Borkowski transported him to an inpatient unit as an emergency 
 detention. 

 At 2 PM, Officer Krueger went with the building inspector and a 
 representative of the Humane Society to keep the peace during an 
 inspection of a rental property on Main Street. The landlord claimed 
 that there were animal waste and unsafe living conditions inside. 
 However, an inspection revealed that the apartment was clean and there 
 were only minor safety issues, such as a missing carbon monoxide 
 detector. Two dogs inside were healthy, but the owner was warned to get 
 them licensed. 

 At 4:07 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department received a burglar alarm at a Town 
 of Jackson residence; the closest deputy was responding from the 
 Allenton area and they requested mutual aid. Officer Krueger kept the 
 home under surveillance until Deputy Survis arrived, at which time they 
 approached the house on foot and determined that it was secure. 

 At about 7 PM, Officers Krueger and Oswald were dispatched to a 
 Chestnut Court apartment building regarding a family fight between a 
 37-year-old woman and her 59-year-old father. The officers were told 
 that an argument ensued because the Republican father took offense that 
 her Democrat daughter was reading the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which 
 he views as unsympathetic to his point-of-view. 

 At 7:44 PM, a Northview Drive woman told Officer Krueger that while she 
 was sitting in her truck at the Piggly Wiggly, a man opened his driver 
 side door and struck the passenger side of her vehicle. When she got out 
 of her vehicle and asked the man why he had done that, he responded with 
 a hearty&quot;I don&apos;t give a f*** and walked away. No damage was done to 
 the vehicle and the complainant only wanted the man warned. The 
 40-year-old Cedarburg man later told Chief Dolnick that the woman had 
 scowled at him when he got out of his vehicle. He told her that he 
 didn&apos;t care if she called the police because he didn&apos;t do anything 
 wrong, but denied using profanity. 

 On February 19 at 5:11 AM, Dispatch received a report that a woman was 
 arguing with a male subject outside a Green Valley residence and the 
 woman was claiming she had been raped. Officer Borkowski, assisted by 
 Deputy Vanier, responded. A 32-year-old Milwaukee woman told the 
 officers that she drove up to console her boyfriend because he lost his 
 job. After consuming alcohol, she fell asleep in the bedroom. She was 
 awakened by the man who was yelling at her and trying to hold her down; 
 she said there was no sexual assault. The man said that he and the woman 
 had gotten into an argument during which she claimed he raped her, which 
 he denied. Neither subject wanted any further action taken. The woman 
 had no way to get back to Milwaukee, so Officer Borkowski gave her a 
 ride to her residence near 60 th and Blue Mound. 

 At 9:30 AM, Detective Foeger was working an open patrol shift and 
 dispatched to the Main Street Mart because a customer had locked himself 
 inside the bathroom for an hour after being unable to pay for gas. The 
 37-year-old man told the officer that he was just charging his cell 
 phone in the bathroom with the clerk&apos;s approval; he was trying to keep 
 it charged so he could obtain a tow through his insurance company. 
 However, the clerk denied giving him such permission, and the officer 
 noted that there were wall outlets in the store itself that could&apos;ve 
 been used. The man called Chief Dolnick the following week because he 
 was displeased that the officer thought he was acting suspiciously. 

  On February 20 at 9:39 PM, a Hickory Lane woman told Officer Gerke 
 that, since they moved into their home the previous month, the former 
 owner has been caught walking around the yard on three occasions. When 
 contacted, the man claimed that he has only driven past the residence 
 and denied ever walking on the property itself. However, the 70-year-old 
 had been cited by Officer Gerke for obstructing after he lied repeatedly 
 concerning harboring unlicensed and unvaccinated cats in the house. He 
 was told that if he was found on the property he would be arrested for 
 trespassing. 

 On February 22 at 9:40 AM, a 48-year-old Hubertus man told Officer 
 Oswald that he was being stalked by a 51-year-old Jackson woman with 
 whom he had a prior relationship. The woman allegedly has been texting, 
 calling, and driving past his residence. After being contacted by 
 Officer Oswald, the woman promised to leave him alone. 

 On February 23 at 2:34 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to an office 
 building, where an argument had broke out between a business owner and 
 employee that culminated in the firing of the latter. A shoving match 
 ensued and some property was thrown around before Officer Henning 
 arrived. The owner was warned for disorderly conduct and the employee 
 was told that he was not to return to the business; he happened to be 
 the owners son-in-law. 

 At 6:15 PM, a Jackson woman told Officer Henning that she was receiving 
 text messages such as,&quot;I see you masturbating right now&quot;,&quot;I know where 
 you are&quot;, and&quot;I&apos;m watching you&quot;. When she replied that she had 
 contacted the police, she received a message stating,&quot;Just a little 
 joke, calm down&quot;. It wasn&apos;t possible to trace the phone number to the 
 sender. 

 On February 24 at 2:10 PM, a real estate agent complained to Officer 
 Oswald that the noise from the nearby industrial Park was&quot;bad for 
 business&quot;. 

 At 7:11 PM, a 33-year-old Green Valley man told Officer Oswald that 
 while he was outside with two young children, his 60-year-old stepfather 
 drove past slowly and made an obscene gesture in their direction. This 
 was the latest of several mutual complaints made between the man and his 
 wife, and the mans estranged mother and her husband. Unfortunately, 
 they live a short distance from each other in separate trailers. The 
 stepfather denied making the gesture and said, in addition, he would 
 certainly not do such a thing in front of his own grandchildren. Because 
 there were no witnesses, no further action was taken. 

 At 8:35 PM, a 47-year-old Green Valley woman told Officer Oswald that 
 her mail box had been tampered with, probably by a man who lives nearby. 
 Officer Oswald showed her that the bolt on the rear of the lock cylinder 
 had simply loosened with use and, once he tightened it, it could be 
 locked. However, the woman insisted that the neighbor had tampered with 
 it and was stalking her, and Officer Oswald promised to keep a lookout 
 while on patrol. 

 On February 25 at about 5 PM, an Old Orchard Court man told Officer 
 Oswald that his ex-wife had taken the children to Minnesota and would 
 not have them home by a court mandated transfer time. This was a civil 
 matter and no action could be taken. 

 On February 26 at 8:30 PM, a 31-year-old New Berlin man told Officer 
 Gerke that the mother of his 11-year-old daughter did not return her 
 according to a custody agreement. This was a civil matter and other than 
 trying to negotiate between the parties, no further action could be 
 taken. 

 On February 27 at 7:13 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to a 
 Georgetown Drive apartment where a 12-year-old boy was out of control. 
 After contacting ACS, the boy was placed in secure detention and Officer 
 Henning referred charges of disorderly conduct and battery to the 
 juvenile authorities. 

 On February 29 at about 2:43 PM, Officer Henning was parked outside of 
 the police station when a Town of Jackson man pulled up in the vehicle 
 and reported that he had been attacked by his 23-year-old daughter as 
 they drove on Main Street. The woman has a history of paranoid 
 schizophrenia and had become and delusional, telling Chief Dolnick that 
 she was pregnant and that her father attacked her. The woman already has 
 pending cases for previous emergency detentions and was turned over to 
 ACS for placement in a nonsecure facility in West Bend. 

 At 8:20 PM, Officers Henning and Borkowski were dispatched to the 
 Latest Edition regarding an intoxicated patron who was brandishing a 
 handgun. Upon arrival, several patrons quietly motioned them towards a 
 50-year-old Jackson man. The man first tried to walk away from the 
 officers and then became resistive while being patted down. Due to the 
 possibility that he was armed, the man was handcuffed and removed from 
 the tavern. The man was both intoxicated and uncooperative. Patrons told 
 the officers that the man was displaying the weapon until ordered to get 
 rid of the gun by one of the owners. However, none of the patrons would 
 provide a statement. The owner denied seeing any weapons inside the bar. 
 The suspect refused to provide a phone number for his residence, so he 
 was transported there by the officers and turned over to the custody of 
 his wife. The weapon was never located. 

 

 January 2012 

 On January 2 at 
 about noon, Officer Fristed and Chief Dolnick responded to a fire alarm 
 at Jackson Elementary School. Per protocol, the students evacuated 
 directly to the playground without stopping for coats and hats. Due to 
 the extreme cold, the Fire Department checked the building as quickly as 
 possible. The cause of the alarm was traced to a bad sensor unit and the 
 children were allowed back into the school. 

 On January 3 at 
 about 9 PM, Officers Krueger and Oswald were dispatched to a family 
 fight on Stonewall Drive after a neighbor heard yelling. The officers 
 spoke to the couple and determined that it was a verbal argument only. 

 At 10:48 PM, a 
 Georgetown Drive woman told Officer Borkowski that her 12-year-old son 
 was uncontrollable and angry with everyone possibly due to family 
 issues. Officer Borkowski spoke to the boy, who agreed to read and then 
 go to sleep. 

 On January 4 at 6 
 PM, Officer Henning and Trooper Perales were dispatched to a reported 
 stabbing that took place in the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly; the 
 victim was at that Latest Edition. After the officers were unable to 
 locate the suspect vehicle at Piggly Wiggly, they went to the tavern to 
 interview the victim. The 48-year-old man reported that he was pushed to 
 the ground by an unknown subject who demanded money. When told he didn&apos;t 
 have any, the suspect used a box cutter to slice the victim&apos;s arm 
 several times. Indeed, the officers observed 20 lacerations on the man&apos;s 
 arm. Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched and the man was taken to the 
 hospital. In the meantime, Officers Krueger and Oswald went to the 
 Piggly Wiggly to obtain surveillance video; the victim wasn&apos;t seen. 
 Although the man said that he had done some shopping at the store, 
 Officer Henning saw there were no grocery bags in his vehicle. After 
 several hours of investigation, it was determined that he had fabricated 
 the attack, and the wounds on his arms were self-inflicted. After he was 
 released from the hospital, the man was arrested for obstructing an 
 officer. 

 On January 5 at 11 
 AM, an 18-year-old Green Valley man told Detective Foeger that he was 
 recently released from jail and was concerned that his aunt, on Chestnut 
 Court, was not turning over his benefit check from the state. The woman 
 protested that the check never arrived. 

 On November 8 at 
 4:36 PM, Officer Henning observed a 69-year-old man stumbling down the 
 sidewalk near the police station. Further investigation revealed that 
 the man had just come out of the Jackson Pub with a blood-alcohol level 
 of .26%. In speaking to the bartender, it appeared that the man had been 
 in the tavern for four hours and consumed at least four gin and tonics. 
 The tavern was cited for serving an intoxicated person. 

 At 5:26 PM, the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department notified Officer Henning that a vehicle had driven 
 through, not around, the roundabout on Highway G at Paradise Drive and 
 was possibly heading towards the village. The license plate listed to a 
 Crestview Drive woman, and in a short time Officer Henning spotted the 
 vehicle approaching him on the wrong side of Jackson Drive. After 
 initiating a traffic stop, he observed that the woman had difficulty 
 communicating and smelled strongly of intoxicants. She had apparently 
 driven from the West Bend tavern where she works. After failing field 
 sobriety tests, she was arrested for her third offense; the blood test 
 was .34%. 

 On January 12 at 3 
 PM, Officer Oswald was dispatched to an Eagle Drive apartment, where a 
 resident reported that his Silverado had just been struck by a 
 hit-and-run driver. Later that night, the man reported that another 
 resident of the building who normally drove a work van was now driving a 
 smaller car. When Officer Oswald spoke to this resident, the man said 
 that he understood the victims suspicions but the van had been parked 
 that day at his business. Officer Oswald went to the industrial park to 
 examine the van and was met by the business owners 22-year-old son, who 
 showed him that the van was undamaged. The son was standing next to a 
 Jeep and, when asked who it belonged to, he said that a friend was 
 letting him drive it while the friend was out-of-state. Following good 
 police procedure, Officer Oswald examined the vehicle and found fresh 
 damage. At first, the son claimed to have hit&quot;something&quot;in Green 
 Valley but after further questioning admitted that he had struck the 
 complainant&apos;s vehicle; he was cited for hit and run. 

 In the early 
 morning hours of January 15, a 48-year-old Main Street man tried to flee 
 from a Washington County deputy and was ultimately arrested in Lomira. 
 As he was being booked in the County Jail at 4:30 AM, he realized that 
 he may have left something on the stove&quot;and asked that Officer Laabs 
 check. 

 On January 16 at 1 
 PM, a 38-year-old woman told Officer Fristed that her younger sister 
 attacked her in the middle of the night. The 28-year-old suspect has had 
 mental health issues for several years. The woman agreed to commit 
 herself voluntarily to an inpatient unit in Fond du Lac and, although 
 it&apos;s unlikely a prosecution will take place, the mandatory domestic 
 violence paperwork was sent to the District Attorney. 

 On January 17 at 
 about 2:15 PM, a 911 caller reported that an erratic driver was heading 
 towards the village on Highway 60. Officer Henning intercepted the 
 vehicle as it turned onto Highway 45 and proceeded to drive on the 
 shoulder. He followed the vehicle with lights and siren all the way to 
 the Paradise Drive exit in West Bend. While doing so, the vehicle&apos;s 
 speed fluctuated between 60 mph and 70 mph, and continued to weave from 
 the centerline to the shoulder repeatedly. Officer Henning requested 
 mutual aid, and officers from West Bend and the Sheriff&apos;s Department 
 blocked traffic on Paradise Drive, allowing Officer Henning to safely 
 stop the vehicle. The 41-year-old Lowell (Dodge County) woman was 
 eventually arrested on suspicion of operating a motor vehicle while 
 under the influence of Oxycodone and possession of a switchblade. 

 Shortly after 7 
 PM, the Sheriff Department requested mutual aid from Officer Henning and 
 Trooper Perales for a vehicle that had struck a telephone pole that had 
 snapped and was now resting on top of the vehicle on Sherman Road East 
 of Highway P. 

 On January 20 at 
 3:30 PM, Officer Oswald and Officer Krueger checked on the welfare of a 
 63-year-old woman who had overdosed on Ambien. There was no immediate 
 emergency, but the woman said that she is bipolar and currently in a 
 depressive state. At first, the woman&apos;s mother agreed to drive her to 
 Community Memorial Hospital for inpatient treatment. However, she 
 reconsidered because the roads were slick and snow-covered, so Officer 
 Oswald drove the woman to CMH as a courtesy. 

 At about 9 PM, a 
 Hartford woman told Officer Gerke that the rear license plate of her car 
 had been stolen while she worked at Walgreens. About an hour later, 
 Deputy Frankow was at the scene of a vehicle-in-the-ditch assignment on 
 Highway 60 just west of the village. Inside the vehicle were several 
 license plates, including the one that had just been reported stolen. 
 The 56-year-old Milwaukee man said that he didn&apos;t know how the plates 
 got into his vehicle but thought maybe some friends of his, whom he 
 couldn&apos;t identify, had left them behind. Officer Gerke issued the man a 
 citation for receiving stolen property, and he was arrested by the 
 deputy for OWI. 

 On January 21 at 
 9:08 AM, a Stonewall Drive man told Officer Fristed that while he was 
 walking his dog, a man started yelling at him for allegedly not picking 
 up the waste. The complainant tried to walk away, and the man came at 
 him and challenged him to a fight. The complainant and his girlfriend 
 tried to tell the man that they don&apos;t let their dog run loose and they 
 do pick up its waste, but to no avail. The 57-year-old Ridgeway Court 
 man was warned for disorderly conduct. 

 On January 24 
 about 12:20 PM, a woman notified the police department that her father, 
 who was currently out on bail for a previous criminal offense and is not 
 supposed to be drinking, was intoxicated. The 59-year-old man, with whom 
 we are very familiar, was uncooperative but eventually conveyed to 
 County Jail for felony bail jumping. 

 On January 25 at 
 11:39 AM, the Sheriff Department requested mutual aid at a traffic crash 
 on Highway 60 at Lily Road in the Town of Polk; Officer Henning 
 responded. 

 On January 31 at 
 7:39 PM, Officers Borkowski, Henning and Krueger were dispatched to a 
 Chestnut Court apartment where a 33-year-old man with whom we are very 
 familiar was depressed, suicidal, had taken pills, was armed with a 
 sword, and planned to commit&quot;suicide by cop&quot;. Officer Krueger located 
 the man behind the apartment complex; he was unarmed and cooperative. 
 The man and his wife explained some of the issues that had caused him to 
 become depressed. At the hospital, the man remarked that he had been 
 watching the officers from a hiding place and would have been able to 
 kill Officer Krueger with his sword. He said the only reason he didn&apos;t 
 was because he&quot;liked JPD officers&quot;and it would&apos;ve been different if 
 deputies or the State Patrol had arrived first. The man was admitted 
 into ICU for treatment and later taken to an inpatient facility. 

 

 December 2011 

 On 
 the afternoon of December 1, a 24-year-old woman told Chief Dolnick that 
 a couple in Ripon was refusing to return her child. She said that a&quot;safety plan&quot;had been initiated by Fond du Lac County because she 
 couldn&apos;t wake up in the morning to properly care for her two-year-old 
 daughter. She claimed to have been thrown out of the house by this 
 couple and was now staying with her mother in Jackson. Before referring 
 them to Ripon PD about the supposed custody interference, the Chief 
 called the Fond du Lac County Department of Social Services; they told a 
 completely different story. The woman and her boyfriend had been 
 stealing to support their drug habits; she&apos;s addicted to opiates and is 
 a heavy marijuana user; while the foster couple was away, she stole 
 their medication and money; and she went joyriding (with a suspended 
 license) in their car with a 17-year-old boy. She had not been&quot;thrown 
 out of the house&quot;; she left on her own, even leaving a note. The little 
 girl was on the safety plan not because of Moms sleeping problem but 
 because of her drug addiction. Obviously, there was no crime being 
 committed.

On December 2 at 2:36 AM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department asked Officer Oswald 
 to set up for a vehicle heading towards the village on Highway P that 
 had driven through, instead of around, the roundabout at Pleasant Valley 
 Road. Deputy Stolz located the vehicle near Northwest Passage and 
 Officer Oswald assisted. The 49-year-old Hemlock Street woman was 
 eventually arrested by the deputy for OWI. 

 A t 
 12:30 PM, Officers Foeger and Friedl and Chief Dolnick were called to 
 Culvers parking lot regarding a man and woman fighting. Chief Dolnick 
 was the first to arrive and saw the woman walking in the nearby bank 
 parking lot. He tried to talk to her but the woman turned and started 
 walking away. She stopped momentarily but then started walking away 
 again, becoming resistive and necessitating being handcuffed by Chief 
 Dolnick and Officer Friedl. She then said that her boyfriend was being 
 picked up by his mother and motioned to a car that was leaving Culvers. 
 Officer Foeger was in the same parking lot but the radio system chose 
 that moment to go silent, so Chief Dolnick couldnt direct him to stop 
 the vehicle. Officer Friedl took off after the vehicle, and his siren 
 attracted the attention of Officer Foeger who backed him up. Ultimately, 
 this was determined to be a family fight without domestic violence, and 
 the subjects were released. However, their unusual behavior was later 
 traced to signs of drug use that they left behind in a room at the 
 nearby Comfort Inn. 

 On 
 December 3 at 3:16 AM, Officer Laabs assisted Deputy Lake with a fire 
 alarm at Living Word Lutheran Church School, which is just outside the 
 village limits. 

 At 
 5:30 PM, a 911 caller reported a hit-and-run accident had just occurred 
 on Highway 60 east of the village. Officer Oswald intercepted the 
 vehicle in front of the Police Department. Officer Oswald observed signs 
 of drug use as he spoke to the 22-year-old Town of Hartford man. He was 
 joined shortly after by Deputy Winiarski who ultimately arrested the man 
 for the hit-and-run and driving while under the influence in the Town of 
 Jackson. 

 On 
 December 4 at 11:40 AM, Officer Friedl was dispatched to the area of 
 Jackson Elementary School regarding someone harassing people who were 
 collecting signatures to recall Gov. Walker. The 49-year-old Jackson man 
 complained because school property was being used and he didn&apos;t think 
 the people should be allowed to hold signs on the sidewalk. It was 
 explained that the sidewalk and the front of the school are public 
 property, and the people have a right to use it for this purpose just as 
 he had a right to counter-protest if he wished. 

 At 
 1:24 PM, Chief Dolnick returned to the elementary school regarding 
 another harassment complaint. A 51-year-old Hubertus man and a 
 50-year-old Cedarburg man had driven up in separate vehicles and&quot;double 
 teamed&quot;the two women who were collecting signatures. The women felt 
 threatened and requested assistance. I told the men that they have a 
 right to counter-protest if they wish, but if the anti-Walker people do 
 not want to engage in conversation, they should be left alone. Both men 
 denied threatening the women; the Chief told them that the women felt threatened by their simultaneous, and hardly coincidental, actions. 

 On 
 December 10, shortly before 1 PM, Officers Gerke and Friedl were 
 dispatched to Green Valley regarding a fight between two sisters, ages 
 21 and 16. According to the initial dispatch, the younger sister had 
 friends in the residence who were drinking alcohol and smoking 
 marijuana. She allegedly assaulted the older sister and then left with 
 her friends. Upon arrival, Officer Gerke observed a group of six 
 juveniles walking through the mobile home park. They were identified as 
 the younger sister and her friends, all from West Bend. She said she was 
 now staying with a friend in West Bend but had permission from her 
 mother to visit the trailer. When her older sister got home, an argument 
 and a shoving match ensued. She said that the beer cans inside of the 
 residence belonged to her mother and none of them had been drinking; 
 this was confirmed with field breath tests. One of the girls had a 
 marijuana pipe, for which she was cited. At the trailer, the older 
 sister pointed out the beer cans and the odor of burned marijuana. As 
 for the scuffle, she asked that no further action be taken. 

 At 
 2:44 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department received a 911 call of a reckless 
 driver heading towards the village on Highway 60. Officer Henning 
 intercepted the vehicle and spoke to the 35-year-old Jackson man. He 
 said that the complainant had actually passed and cut him off, so he was 
 tailgating in retaliation. Both he and the complainant, who was also 
 from Jackson, were warned. 

 Shortly before 5 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department requested mutual aid at a 
 serious crash on Highway P north of Pleasant Valley Road. Officers Gerke 
 and Henning were first to arrive at the scene. They found two heavily 
 damaged vehicles, the result of a head-on crash. Officer Henning 
 extinguished a small fire in the engine compartment of one vehicle. He 
 also provided his medical kit to a first responder and a registered 
 nurse who were assisting a 38-year-old woman in that vehicle. The driver 
 of the other vehicle was being assisted by two other nurses who happened 
 upon the scene. The officers were then joined by Jackson Fire and Rescue 
 personnel and, later, the first deputies arrived. They then handled 
 traffic control because the highway had to be completely closed. Before 
 leaving the area, Officer Gerke handled a one vehicle accident on 
 Highway NN just off of Highway P. The first woman that Officer Henning 
 assisted was transported by Flight for Life to Froedtert Hospital where 
 she was pronounced dead. 

 At 
 8:30 PM, Officers Henning, Gerke, Krueger, and Oswald were dispatched to 
 a Glen Brooke Drive residence regarding a family fight. The number of 
 responding officers was due to shift change and because the caller told 
 Dispatch that one of the parties would fight as soon as she saw the 
 cops. The owner of the residence produced an envelope containing needles 
 that his 32 year old niece, who was living there, uses to inject heroin. 
 Officer Henning located narcotics and paraphernalia in the woman&apos;s 
 living area, while Officer Oswald found a metal tin dish used to cook 
 heroin inside her vehicle. The uncle had become aware of drug use after 
 the womans six-year-old daughter came upon needles in her mother&apos;s 
 clothing. He reported that her husband is also a heroin addict and is 
 currently incarcerated in an Illinois prison. The woman told Officer 
 Gerke that she had used approximately $2000 worth of heroin in the past 
 month and obtained it from a source in Chicago. It was discovered during 
 this investigation that the woman had also been stealing jewelry from 
 her uncle and pawning it for drug money. The woman was arrested at the 
 time for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, and later charged 
 with stealing $11,000 worth of jewelry. 

 On 
 December 11 at about 1:30 AM, Officers Oswald and Krueger were 
 dispatched to an anonymous complaint of a fight in progress in a 
 Ridgeway Drive apartment. They spoke to the 23-year-old female renter 
 and a female friend. The officers could see numerous empty and partially 
 filled containers of vodka and beer, and were told that the disturbance 
 had been caused by a prank that had gone wrong during a party. 
 Apparently, a woman took offense at being tea bagged by a male guest. 
 This refers to a sexual act, not Tea Party activism. An argument ensued 
 but there was nothing physical and they left. 

 On 
 December 12 at about 3 PM, Chief Dolnick investigated a report of 
 suspicious persons in a large detention pond near the Jackson Clinic. The men were checking the area for the possibility of laying muskrat 
 traps. They told Chief Dolnick that they wanted to file a complaint that 
 their traps in another basin had been stolen. However, Officer Henning 
 advised that those traps had been removed by the DNR because they 
 weren&apos;t tagged. The men were told that the warden would be in touch with 
 them. 

 At 
 3:21 PM, Officer Henning and Chief Dolnick were dispatched to an 
 apartment where an 11-year-old boy was out of control. The boy had 
 thrown his mattress out a second story window, and as well as clothing 
 and any other objects he could find. The tantrum was provoked when his 
 mother took away his Xbox for skipping school. His mother had already 
 been in touch with ACS, which instituted a safety plan that obviously 
 wasn&apos;t working. The boy was told that if this happened again he would be 
 detained. A juvenile referral for disorderly conduct and damage to 
 property was submitted. See December 13. 

 At 
 5:11 PM, a 19-year-old woman told Officer Henning that her boyfriend 
 attacked her during an argument the previous afternoon in the Juniper 
 Street residence they share. The woman, who is pregnant with his child, 
 had told the man that she didn&apos;t like the way he was treating her. He 
 responded by pushing her onto a bed, grabbing her arm, and twisting it 
 in front of her. Downstairs, he pushed her into a chair and put his 
 hands around her neck and head butted her. She kicked him in the shin to 
 get away and started packing belongings. He gave her a final kick in the 
 leg before she left the residence. Deputy Survis accompanied Officer 
 Henning to the residence and arrested the man. He denied all physical 
 contact with the exception of&quot;unintentionally&quot;kicking her. 

 On 
 December 13 at 6:11 PM, Officer Henning and Chief Dolnick returned to 
 the apartment where the 11-year-old boy had again gone out of control 
 and started destroying property and throwing objects. As before, the boy 
 had lost use of his Xbox for skipping school. This time the boy was 
 arrested and placed in detention, and another referral was sent for 
 disorderly conduct and damage to property. 

 At 
 7:41 PM a man called 911 because he was concerned that an argument with 
 his wife was becoming heated. Officer Borkowski was told that the couple 
 has had a tremendous amount of stress due to a medical problem. She 
 encouraged them to be more open with each other about these issues and 
 to seek counseling. 

 On 
 December 14 at 8 PM, Officer Borkowski was dispatched to a Lea Fon 
 Circle residence where a woman had come home and found her roommate 
 apparently deceased. The woman explained that she had left at 8 AM while 
 the victim was in a living room chair and came home 12 hours later to 
 find the woman still in the chair and cold to the touch. The victim had 
 many long-term medical issues and foul play was not suspected. Officer 
 Borkowski assisted the Medical Examiner and photographed the scene. 

 On 
 December 15 at 6:15 PM, Officer Gerke assisted the Sheriff&apos;s Department 
 with traffic control at a crash on Highway 60 at Highway G. 

 On 
 December 16 at about 10 PM, Officer Foeger received an anonymous 
 complaint of the strong odor of marijuana coming a condo units basement 
 on Cranberry Creek Lane. In November, Jackson officers found hazardous 
 materials in the unit that were being used to manufacture a 
 hallucinogenic drug; that case is still open pending a report from the 
 Crime Lab. As the officers walked up to the front door, a male subject 
 walked around the corner of a condo, saw them, and walked quickly in the 
 opposite direction. Officer Foeger caught up to him as he walked towards 
 a rear patio. The 18-year-old son of the condo owner, two girls and 
 another young man was sitting around. The 18-year-old was uncooperative 
 and denied smoking marijuana. The strong odor of alcohol was coming from 
 all of their breaths; they denied drinking alcohol despite empty beer 
 cans in front of them. In the meantime, the young man&apos;s mother was 
 looking at the officers through the patio door but did not come out to 
 see why the police were there. All four subjects were temporarily 
 detained and cited for consumption of alcohol; two deputies came to 
 assist. One of them, a 17-year-old West Bend girl came close to being 
 arrested for initially refusing to identify herself. The officers 
 developed information that led to the mother being cited for failure to 
 prevent underage consumption of alcohol on premises under her control. 

 On 
 December 17 at 10:26 AM, a 25-year-old man told Officer Gerke that his 
 ex-girlfriend had just thrown his belongings out the window and was not 
 allowing him back into their Ridgeway Drive apartment to get remaining 
 property. The man said that he hooked up with the woman via the Internet 
 and came from Minneapolis to live with her a month earlier. He wanted to 
 return to the Land of a Thousand Lakes, but had no money and didnt know 
 anyone in this area. He and the 28-year-old woman got into an argument, 
 culminating in her throwing his suitcase and duffel bag out the window. 
 When contacted on the phone, the woman refused to come to the door, 
 saying,&quot;I threw his shit out the window and I&apos;m done with it&quot;. The 
 woman was cited for disorderly conduct and her probation agent was 
 notified. The victim went across the street to speak with a neighbor who 
 had offered to help them return from whence he came. 

 Shortly after 12:00 PM, Chief Dolnick cited a 35 year old Saukville man 
 for Indecent Conduct after he yelled F***ing loser at a man holding a 
 Recall Walker sign on Main Street. 

 On 
 December 18 shortly before noon, Officer Gerke assisted Deputy Essinger 
 regarding a suspicious subject he spotted at Dave&apos;s Auto. 

 At 
 2:50 AM, Officers Krueger and Oswald observed vehicles parked at Christ 
 Lutheran Church. Later, they observed a 19-year-old West Bend man 
 staggering into the parking lot from the direction of a residence thats 
 been the scene of alcohol parties. Although they could smell intoxicants 
 on his breath, the man denied having anything to drink. He consented to 
 a field test which showed .09%; he was cited for underage drinking. Two 
 more youths, also from West Bend, then came upon the scene and went 
 through the same ritual of denial followed by field tests that showed 
 theyd been drinking; they also were cited. The occupants of the home, 
 with whom we are very familiar, refused to answer the door. The 
 pedestrians were released to sober adults. 

 On 
 December 19 at 2:41 PM, Officers Gerke and Foeger, and Chief Dolnick, 
 responded to a rescue call at a Cedar Run Drive residence because the 
 woman living there has a history of being combative. A neighbor met the 
 officers outside and explained that he had called for the rescue squad 
 because the woman had become unconscious after a day of heavy drinking. 
 The woman awakened and was cooperative. However, her 31-year-old 
 daughter was verbally abusive to the officers and firefighters. When an 
 EMT asked a question about her mother, she replied,&quot;What the f*** does 
 that have to do with anything?&quot;She continued to be abusive and 
 constantly interfered with the EMTs as they tried to speak to her 
 mother. She then went to the kitchen and sat down next to kitchen 
 knives. Due to her agitated and uncooperative condition, Officer Foeger 
 asked her to step out of the kitchen. Officer Foeger and Chief Dolnick 
 directed her back to the family room and asked her to sit down. She 
 refused and tried to take a swing at Officer Foeger, which was blocked 
 by Officer Gerke. The woman swung her arms and fell onto the chair, then 
 started resisting Officer Foeger&apos;s attempts to hold her down. The EMTs 
 were still attempting to assist her mother in the close confines of his 
 family room. Officer Gerke deployed her Taser and the woman was finally 
 secured and taken into custody. Ironically, although the daughter had to 
 be taken to the hospital to be checked out, her mother, who had been the 
 original person in need, did not. By the time her daughter was being 
 removed, the victim was alert, conscious and speaking with officers. She 
 told her daughter that she had been a&quot;dumb ass&quot;. At the hospital, the 
 daughter apologized to the officers for her behavior. Nevertheless, she 
 was taken to jail on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. 
 Her blood alcohol was .20%. 

 At 
 about 6:15 PM, Officers Foeger and Gerke were driving back to the 
 village after booking the woman in the above incident. While stopped on 
 Washington at 18th in West Bend, they observed a southbound green Chevy 
 Lumina try to beat the red light. Instead, it blew the red and crashed 
 into a vehicle on Washington Street. The officers notified West Bend PD 
 and assisted the victims until backup arrived. A video of the crash was 
 captured on their squad video and turned over to that department. 

 On 
 December 20 at 7:30 PM, Officer Borkowski was dispatched to a Green 
 Valley residence after a caregiver reported finding her 85-year-old 
 client unresponsive in the bathroom. Officer Borkowski arrived at the 
 same time as Jackson Fire Rescue. The EMTs began CPR and she was then 
 transported to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. The victim 
 had a long history of serious medical conditions, and foul play was not 
 suspected. Officer Borkowski assisted the Medical Examiner. 

 On 
 December 21 at 3:35 AM, Officer Laabs was dispatched to the Latest 
 Addition regarding a burglary that occurred in the rooming house 
 upstairs. The 22-year-old victim reported that a rifle, ammunition 
 magazine, Bowie knife, and a deer hide were missing from his room. He 
 said that a friend had called to tell him that another tenant told him 
 he took the rifle out of the room and placed it in his own. Officer 
 Laabs contacted the District Attorney for a search warrant. At 4:30 AM, 
 while a deputy secured the scene, Officer Laabs met first with DA Bensen 
 and then went to Judge Gonrings home at about 6:30 AM to have the 
 warrant signed. After the door was forced open, Officer Laabs observed a 
 homemade bong and a marijuana grinder on a closet shelf. When he moved a 
 pile of clothing to see if the rifle had been hidden underneath, he 
 turned up a set of brass knuckles. The contraband was seized but the 
 rifle wasnt located. About an hour before the burglary had been 
 reported, Officer Laabs had questioned an individual walking behind a 
 business near Jackson Park; it was the 18-year-old whose room he just 
 searched. Knowing that the suspect had been walking between the tavern 
 and that location, Officer Laabs and the deputy searched the area. They 
 found a large hole in the floor of the porch near the entrance to the 
 rooming house upstairs. Officer Laabs looked through the hole and was 
 able to see a black Bowie knife under the porch. After photographing it 
 in place, the knife was retrieved. It was later brought back to the 
 police station where it was photographed again and an unsuccessful 
 attempt was made to lift fingerprints from it. By now, it was 6 AM and 
 Officers Fristed and Oswald had come on duty for the day shift. They 
 assisted Officer Laabs in searching the route that the suspect would&apos;ve 
 taken after being questioned by Officer Laabs earlier that morning. The 
 victim was questioned some more and said that the tipster and the 
 suspect had both been in his room earlier that evening, and both knew 
 about the weapons and how to enter his room. At 7:40 AM, Investigator 
 Foeger met the officers at the rooming house; he was aware that the 
 prime suspect was living with his aunt in a Chestnut Court apartment. 
 The officers told the suspect that they needed to find this weapon and 
 were concerned that he had hidden the gun near Jackson Park, which could 
 be dangerous if found by the child. The man led them to a storage locker 
 in the apartment buildings basement, where the rifle was retrieved. The 
 man agreed to voluntarily come to the police station to give a 
 statement, after which he was arrested for burglary. 

 On 
 December 22 at 6:41 PM, Officer Henning observed a vehicle driving on 
 Main Street at about 10 mph. The vehicle then picked up speed to 35 mph 
 (in a 25 mph zone) and started weaving badly. After stopping the 
 vehicle, he spoke to the 35-year-old Milwaukee man, who smelled of both 
 intoxicants and burned marijuana. He turned over a marijuana pipe that 
 had been made from a deer antler. While being questioned, the man said 
 that he had been drinking for 3 to 4 hours during a holiday work party 
 at the Jackson Pub. He failed sobriety tests and was arrested; the blood 
 test was .29%. 

 On 
 December 23 at 6:11 PM, Dispatch reported a possible intoxicated driver 
 heading towards the village on Highway 45 from the Germantown area. A 
 witness reported that the vehicle had exited at Highway 145 and was 
 first northbound on Highway P and then eastbound on Sherman Road. No 
 deputies were in the area. Officer Gerke was able to intercept the 
 vehicle and saw that it was driving erratically and pass through the 
 stop sign at the railroad crossing. Moments after stopping the vehicle 
 she was joined by Deputies Korth and Herriges. The 50-year-old man 
 failed his field sobriety tests and was arrested for his fourth offense. 
 At the hospital, the man kept asking why he couldn&apos;t have been allowed 
 to drive home since he was only a couple of blocks away. He told Officer 
 Gerke several times that she was ruining his f***ing Christmas, was 
 causing him to be a felon now, and would be responsible for the end of 
 his marriage. The man urinated in his pants while in the squad and again 
 while at the hospital. The blood test was .26%. 

 On 
 December 30 at 6 PM, Officer Henning and Deputy Korth responded to 
 Jackson Crossings regarding a pulseless/non-breather. The elderly woman 
 suffered from dementia and arthritis. Shed been released from the 
 hospital for a urinary tract infection and returned to this 
 community-based residential facility a few hours earlier. At about 5:30 
 PM, she started having difficulty speaking, slumped backwards and became 
 unresponsive. The woman had a&quot;do not resuscitate&quot;order, so her 
 condition was only monitored as her pulse and breathing slowed and she 
 eventually passed away. Officer Henning assisted the Medical Examiner. 

 On 
 December 31 at 11:17 AM, the owner of a business on the corner of Main 
 and Jackson complained to Officer Fristed that an anti-Walker person was 
 walking back and forth in front of his business. He was told that it was 
 a public sidewalk and the man had a right to do that, but the man was 
 asked not to stop where the businesss driveway crossed the sidewalk. 

 At 
 1:50 PM, Officers Fristed and Henning intercepted a suspect who had just 
 left a home on Canyon Drive in the Town of Jackson after a domestic 
 disturbance. He was detained until deputies arrived and arrested him. 

 At 
 3:27 PM, Officer Henning responded to a home on Stonehedge Drive 
 regarding a snowmobile that was on fire near a garage in the house. Upon 
 arrival he found the snowmobile about 5 feet away from the garage, fully 
 engulfed in flames. He verified that everybody was outside of the house 
 and that asked the occupants of homes on either side to also clear out 
 in case the fire spread. He saw a woman lying down screaming, about 30 
 feet from the fire. The 42-year-old had injured her ankle and was unable 
 to walk, so Officer Henning carried her to a nearby home and called for 
 Jackson Fire Rescue. The homeowner reported that the snowmobile was on a 
 trailer attached to his truck. When he started it up, the engine made a 
 popping sound and flames started shooting out from it. He dropped the 
 snowmobile off the trailer and drove his truck away, however that left 
 the snowmobile dangerously close to the house. 

 

 

 November 2011 

 On November 2 at 7:10 PM, 
 Officers Henning and Gerke were dispatched to a 911 hang-up at a Green 
 Valley residence. This turned out to be a dispute between a 44-year-old 
 woman and her 33-year-old nephew, residents of separate trailers, over 
 whether the nephew could operate her son&apos;s vehicle. The man had to be 
 warned several times to calm down. The owner of the vehicle is in County 
 Jail and was contacted by phone; he gave verbal permission for his 
 cousin to drive the car. 

 Immediately after the above 
 case, a 56-year-old Ridgeway Drive woman reported that a neighbor came 
 over earlier in the evening, highly intoxicated, reeking of alcohol and 
 having difficulty speaking. She fixed him some dinner in hopes of 
 sobering him up but he kept talking abnormally and was asked to leave. 
 The man was now making repeated phone calls. Officers Henning and Gerke 
 went to the man&apos;s home but he refused to answer the door; he could be 
 seen sitting in a chair watching television. A short time later, the 
 woman reported that the man had just called and asked her,&quot;Why the f*** 
 are the cops around my place? The man recently moved here from West 
 Allis, and that Police Department was able to provide his cell phone 
 number due to their own contacts with them. A message was left that he 
 would be arrested if he continued to make contact with the complainant. 

 On November 5 at about 7:15 
 PM, Officer Henning stopped a vehicle without license plates on Main 
 Street. The driver and two passengers were all young men from Sheboygan. 
 Officer Henning could see a pair of forceps on the floor of the vehicle. 
 Either the men had been at a medical convention or the forceps were 
 being used to hold the ends of marijuana cigarettes and cigars. Due to 
 the smell of marijuana, he concluded it was the latter. A routine 
 inquiry was made, and he found that the driver was on probation and one 
 of the passengers had numerous marijuana convictions. The vehicle owner 
 gave consent to search and a freshly rolled marijuana cigar was found 
 inside a White Owl package. Everyone denied ownership, so the vehicle 
 owner was cited for the possession. 

 On November 7 at about 2:30 
 PM, a clerk at the East Side Mart reported that a man whod been 
 loitering in the store had walked out and collapsed at a nearby 
 retention pond. Officers Henning and Fristed, and Detective Bloedel, 
 responded. Detective Bloedel located the subject on Georgetown Drive. 
 The 22-year-old Eagle Drive man was extremely intoxicated and had 
 difficulty talking; a field test was .31%. The man said that he drinks 
 every day and was hoping to get some treatment&quot;soon&quot;. His father was 
 called and took custody of the man. See November 14. 

 Later that afternoon, Officers 
 Fristed and Henning monitored a broadcast from West Bend PD regarding a 
 subject in a stolen vehicle and wanted for domestic violence. The 
 officers set up on Highway 45 and within minutes intercepted the 
 vehicle. They initiated a high-risk traffic stop as it exited onto 
 Highway 60. The 27-year-old man was arrested without incident and turned 
 over to West Bend. 

 On November 9 at about 5 PM, 
 deputies were dispatched to the Twin Creeks subdivision, just outside 
 the village limits, for a residential burglar alarm. Officer Gerke 
 assisted Deputy Giese because his backup was coming from a considerable 
 distance. 

 At 6:50 PM, Officers Gerke and 
 Foeger met with a 21-year-old Hemlock Street man who said that his 
 ex-girlfriend and mother of his child had sent a text message that she 
 was going to break his game console and aquarium inside the apartment. 
 However, when they arrived they found that no damage had been done and 
 the woman had simply been making threats. The officers kept the peace 
 while the man grabbed belongings so he could leave the apartment until 
 things cooled off. 

 On November 10 at 3:34 PM, a 
 40-year-old Oakland Drive woman told Officer Foeger that her 
 ex-boyfriend, currently a work-release inmate at the County Jail, kept 
 calling her landline and cell phone. Officer Foeger contacted the man 
 and warned him that if the calls continued he would be prosecuted for 
 harassment and his probation officer would be notified. 

 At about 4:30 PM, a Hemlock 
 Street man told Officer Foeger that his 11-year-old daughter was bullied 
 and pushed by a 13-year-old neighbor girl as they got off the school 
 bus. His daughter had been subjected to bullying by several girls, with 
 the 13-year-old being the alleged ringleader. She was cited for 
 disorderly conduct and ordered to appear in court with her parents. 

 On November 11, shortly after 
 11 PM, Slinger Officer Uttech requested assistance at an underage 
 drinking party. She had arrived at an apartment building and intercepted 
 two men and a woman who had been drinking and smoking marijuana, and 
 more people were thought to be inside. Officers Laabs, Krueger and 
 Oswald responded. As they were securing the two men in Officer Uttechs 
 squad, someone yelled from the second floor that people were jumping on 
 the roof. A 20-year-old Milwaukee man was coaxed off of a landing; he 
 was found to be heavily intoxicated and holding a marijuana pipe. A 
 person thought to be a renter refused to allow the officers inside an 
 apartment. The officers then assisted Officer Uttech as the people in 
 custody were cited and turned over to responsible parties. Just as the 
 last of them were released, the actual renter of the apartment arrived 
 at the police station. He said that he had just been at one of the bars, 
 heard what was going on, and agreed to allow the officers inside. 
 Everyone went back to the building and found 15 people, ages 16 to 32, 
 inside the apartment. Those who had been drinking were cited and 
 released. The officers were finally able to leave at about 3:30 AM. 

 On November 12 at 9:13 PM, 
 Officer Henning saw a 29-year-old West Bend man staggering and stumbling 
 down Main Street near Walgreens. The man refused to say which bar he was 
 coming from. A field test was .29%; the man was released to his wife. 
 See November 19. 

 On November 13 at about 5:30 
 PM, Officer Henning stopped a vehicle on Main at Jackson Drive for a 
 defective muffler. In speaking to the 47-year-old Hemlock Street man, 
 the officer noticed that the man smelled of beer and his speech was slow 
 and slurred. The man said that he had three or four Budweiser&apos;s. Deputy 
 Herbst arrived to assist. A routine inquiry revealed that the man had 
 five prior OWI convictions. Because of the high winds, the field tests 
 were conducted at St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital. As the officers arrived, Deputy 
 Herbst was called away because of a disorderly subject in the lobby. The 
 man then said that he had four or five beers at a benefit for a friend 
 with brain cancer. He failed the field tests and was arrested for his 
 sixth offense. The maximum legal blood-alcohol level after four 
 convictions is only .02%; the blood test was .189% 

 At 7:14 PM a 53-year-old South 
 Center Street woman told Officers Henning, Krueger and Oswald that her 
 39-year-old brother, with whom she shares an apartment, had&quot;gone off 
 the deep end&quot;and believed she and another brother were conspiring 
 against him. During an argument he called her a variety of profanities, 
 grabbed a metal baseball bat, and said that he was going to beat someone 
 up. Fearing for her life, she left her apartment and drove away. The 
 brother followed her in his own truck until she pulled into the Police 
 Department parking lot. Because the man may have been in possession of 
 firearms, the officers were assisted by two deputies. After searching 
 the apartment and finding it empty, the officers went outside just as 
 the man pulled up in his vehicle. The man was arrested for disorderly 
 conduct and placed in a squad. A search of the mans truck turned up a 
 metal baseball bat on the floor and a knife on the dash. The man was 
 cited, booked and released. He called Chief Dolnick the next day and 
 asked why his street had been blocked by officers during trick or 
 treat in 2008. When told that it never happened, the man became upset 
 and threatened to call his lawyer. 

 On November 14 at 2:48 PM, an 
 off-duty Sheriff&apos;s sergeant reported that a drunk or drugged man was 
 walking through Jackson Park. Chief Dolnick located the man on Tower 
 Drive, and Officer Henning recognized him as the same man who had been 
 found intoxicated a week earlier behind Eastside Mart. The man protested 
 that he was simply trying to walk to work. However, a field test showed 
 a blood-alcohol level of .26%. As he pulled out his cell phone to call 
 his father, a bag of marijuana fell out of his pocket. He was arrested 
 for possession of marijuana and a pipe. 

 At 5 PM, a 24-year-old Hickory 
 Lane woman told Officers Henning and Oswald that her 23-year-old 
 boyfriend (and father of her children) was currently passed out on the 
 couch of their apartment. Two months earlier, the man had promised to 
 turn himself in on open warrants in return for temporarily vacating the 
 apartment so his girlfriend could retrieve clothing for the children. 
 That promise was quickly forgotten. The officers found the man almost 
 naked, woke him up, and had him put clothes on. In plain view were pills 
 that were whole or crushed; utensils for snorting drugs; and assorted 
 tools for using drugs. The man was arrested on the open warrants, as 
 well as for possession of the illegal drugs and bail jumping. 

 At 10:09 PM, Officer Henning 
 was on routine patrol and stopped a vehicle because the registered owner 
 was suspended. While talking to the 19-year-old Grafton man, the officer 
 could see a folded tinfoil heroin bindle on the passenger seat and a 
 spoon on the floor behind the driver seat. A search of the vehicle also 
 turned up a marijuana pipe in the glove box; another folded bindle; a 
 lighter with marijuana residue; and a sandwich bag with flakes of 
 marijuana. No heroin was found. Despite his protests of not knowing 
 these things were in his vehicle, the man was cited for possession of 
 paraphernalia. 

 On November 15 at 8:47 PM, 
 Officer Henning stopped a vehicle on Main Street as it passed the 
 Village Hall because the registered owner only had an instructional 
 permit. The vehicle continued to travel south on Jackson Drive with 
 Officer Henning following it with lights and siren activated. He 
 continued to follow the vehicle as it entered the Cranberry Creek 
 development and continued to travel until finally coming to a stop. 
 Officer Henning conducted a high risk traffic stop, during which the 
 vehicle started rolling backwards and almost struck his squad. Officers 
 Foeger and Oswald arrived to assist. It was difficult to get the man to 
 understand the instructions being shouted at him but he was eventually 
 handcuffed. The 32-year-old Blackberry Circle man was having difficulty 
 standing, had bloodshot and watery eyes, and slow, slurred speech. He 
 wasn&apos;t making any sense and had difficulty understanding what was going 
 on. Due to his condition, field sobriety tests could not be administered 
 and he was arrested based upon Officer Henning&apos;s observations; the blood 
 test was .13% 

 On November 17 at midnight, 
 Officer Borkowski and Deputy Lake were dispatched to a Green Valley 
 residence regarding a family trouble. The 38-year-old woman had asked 
 her boyfriend of three years to find a new place to live because the 
 relationship was over. An argument ensued, so she picked up her 
 eight-year-old daughter by another relationship and went to a neighbor&apos;s 
 trailer. The woman and the officers returned to her residence and found 
 the man standing in the kitchen with a cased pistol on the counter. 
 Although the man claimed he was packing up his things, the gun case was 
 the only item there. Eventually, it was agreed that the couple would 
 separate for the night and the officer would take temporary custody of 
 the weapon. 

 At 6:39 PM, Officer Gerke 
 monitored a dispatch of a car fire in the area of Highway P at Highway 
 PV. A follow-up broadcast indicated that the vehicle was not a fire but 
 was spewing smoke because it was doing&quot;burnouts&quot;in front of the tavern 
 at the corner. Another caller reported that there may have been a 
 traffic crash, and the driver and the passenger were both intoxicated. 
 Because deputies were some distance away, Dispatch requested mutual aid 
 from Officer Gerke. Upon arrival, she found a sports car in the ditch 
 near the intersection and observed a 38-year-old woman walking towards 
 the bar. A pedestrian reported that he&apos;d almost been struck by the 
 vehicle. As Deputy Dexter arrived, the officers observed the driver, a 
 51-year-old West Bend man, walking behind a nearby building. After being 
 detained, he started resisting and tried to hit his head on the squad 
 door. He was eventually arrested by deputies for drunk driving and taken 
 to the hospital. 

 Shortly after 6 PM on November 
 19, a caller reported that two intoxicated men were walking on Main 
 Street just east of the Village Hall. The men were&quot;falling over drunk&quot;. 
 One of the men was the person found intoxicated earlier in the month; 
 the other was a 30-year-old Chteau Drive man. As Officer Gerke 
 approached, one of them walked into a utility pole and the other 
 stumbled and fell into the grass. The local man said that he was too 
 drunk to drive so he decided to walk home. The two of them were released 
 to the custody of the local man&apos;s wife. When told that his glasses were 
 missing, Officer Gerke returned to the scene and found the glasses on 
 the sidewalk. 

 On November 21 at 3:10 PM, 
 Officer Gerke intercepted a semi for the Ozaukee County Sheriff&apos;s 
 Department after it allegedly ran a red light in their jurisdiction. 

 Shortly after 5 PM, Officer 
 Henning was dispatched to a family problem on Glen Hill Drive. We have 
 dealt with this couple many times in the past several years. In this 
 case, the 36-year-old Menomonee Falls man parked his car in front of the 
 woman&apos;s driveway to pick up children&apos;s clothing and locked his keys in 
 the car. 

 On November 24 at 7:18 AM, 
 Officers Fristed and Oswald were dispatched to a Green Valley residence 
 for a possible deceased man. They found a 75-year-old man on the floor 
 and connected an external defibrillator, but the device advised not to 
 shock. Jackson Fire Rescue arrived and inserted an IV and began CPR. An 
 intercept unit from the West Bend Fire Department arrived and 
 administered additional medication. However, the man did not respond 
 and, after radio communication with a physician at the hospital, the man 
 was pronounced dead. The officers assisted the family and the medical 
 examiner. 

 On November 25 at about 8:30 
 PM, Officer Henning stopped a vehicle on Main Street after determining 
 that the registered owner, a 20-year-old Eastwood Circle man who he is 
 familiar with, had a warrant from West Bend. While talking to the man, 
 the officer could smell marijuana coming from the vehicle. The man 
 produced a clear plastic bag containing 27 g of marijuana. He was 
 arrested on a warrant and a request for criminal charges for the 
 marijuana possession was sent to the District Attorney. 

 On November 27 at 2 PM, 
 Officer Gerke was dispatched to the Community Center. The building had 
 been rented for a baby&apos;s birthday party and some partygoers were upset 
 that people gathering signatures to recall Governor Walker were outside. 
 Officer Gerke informed them that the people have a right to be on public 
 property. 

 At 2:22 PM, Officers Gerke and 
 Foeger were dispatched to a Hickory Lane home where an argument had 
 broken out between an 18-year-old woman and her parents over a 
 shoplifting citation she had received in West Bend. 

 At 2:45 PM, the owner of PJs 
 Ice Cream told Officer Gerke that people holding Recall Walker signs 
 were obstructing the driveway; he was also afraid that passersby would 
 associate him with the recall. He was told that the sign holders have a 
 right to be on the sidewalk but could not obstruct the driveway or use 
 his parking lot. The petition people told her that they were trying to 
 point people towards the Community Center but some people got confused. 
 They also said they were being careful not to block his driveway. One of 
 the workers, a 43-year-old Cranberry Creek woman, asked Officer Gerke 
 why she was&quot;harassing&quot;them. Officer Gerke said that she had to respond 
 when someone called for assistance, as the owner of the ice cream store 
 had done. 

 At 3:42 PM, Officer Gerke 
 intercepted a vehicle that a caller reported was weaving on Highway 60 
 in Slinger. In speaking to the 19-year-old Juneau man, it appeared that 
 he had been texting-while-driving. He was turned over to Slinger PD. 

 On November 29 at 2:40 PM, 
 Officer Foeger arrested a 20-year-old Main Street man for bail jumping 
 after it was found that he had been on the Internet and messaging people 
 by using an Xbox. The man had been arrested three weeks earlier for 
 sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl he had met on Facebook. 

 At 10:52 PM, Officers Oswald 
 and Krueger were dispatched to the porch of the Latest Edition, where a 
 37-year-old Waubeka man said that he felt suicidal. The man was 
 eventually taken to Rogers Memorial Hospital in West Allis for 
 emergency detention. 

 On November 30 at 9:14 PM, a 
 Parkview Drive woman told Officers Oswald and Krueger that a neighbor 
 had come out of the house and threatened to&quot;kick your asses&quot;after her 
 children strayed from the sidewalk onto his property near a bedroom 
 window. The man apologized for the outburst, explaining that it was dark 
 outside and he was upset that they were outside the bedroom window where 
 his wife was. 

 

 October 2011 

   

 Jackson officers assisted the 
 Fire Department at 10 fire or rescue calls this month. 

 On October 1, at about 9 AM, 
 Officer Friedl assisted Slinger PD with a traffic stop involving a 
 probationer who violated a no-drink order. 

 On October 2 at 3 AM, Officer 
 Gerke observed a vehicle on Jackson Drive with its high beams on. When 
 she flashed her lights to signal this, the vehicle turned on Ridge Road 
 with all of its lights off and pulled into a driveway. She knew that the 
 house was occupied by two young men with whom we&apos;ve had contact 
 regarding drug use. While speaking to the 17-year-old driver, she could 
 smell the odor of burnt marijuana. He claimed he turned the headlights 
 off so he wouldn&apos;t wake his mother up as he pulled into the driveway. 
 When asked about the marijuana smell, he admitted to smoking a&quot;bowl&quot;of 
 marijuana with his passenger, his 16-year-old brother. Officer Fristed 
 arrived to assist. A wooden pipe and a glass bowl were found in the 
 driver&apos;s pocket, both containing marijuana residue. The driver admitted 
 that there was a glass marijuana pipe in the center console. Officer 
 Gerke also found a can of beer under the passenger seat and an open case 
 of more beer in the rear. While being booked at the police station, the 
 driver remarked that he was&quot;glad to see that Jackson cops have nothing 
 better to do&quot;, which is a clich insult we often hear from the 
 just-arrested. The 17-year-old was arrested for operating while under 
 the influence of controlled substances, underage transportation of 
 intoxicants, operating with a prohibited passenger, and possession of 
 drug paraphernalia. See October 6. 

 At about 7 AM, Officer Gerke 
 was on her way home, still in uniform, after finishing her paperwork for 
 the above arrest. As she approached Highway P, she saw that a car had 
 struck a driveway culvert and telephone pole in front of a home. Officer 
 Friedl arrived shortly after. Officer Gerke was told by the driver, a 
 17-year-old Sheboygan man, that he must&apos;ve fallen asleep at the wheel. 
 Jackson Fire Rescue responded because the man said he hurt his head. 
 Officer Gerke could smell the odor of burnt marijuana coming from the 
 man, who admitted smoking within the last couple of hours. The man said 
 that he had been robbed earlier that night in Sheboygan, and was now 
 trying to drive to Madison. The Sheboygan PD confirmed his story but 
 that it appeared to be a drug deal gone bad. Further investigation by 
 Officer Gerke revealed that the vehicle had been stolen by the young man 
 while attending a large party in that city. The man was arrested for 
 operating while under the influence of controlled substances and booked 
 in the County Jail for operating a motor vehicle without owner&apos;s 
 consent. In addition, Sheboygan PD was investigating the theft of the 
 vehicle from their jurisdiction and the circumstances for why the man 
 had close to $900 in cash when arrested. 

 At 3:09 PM, the owner of the 
 Latest Edition reported that a man was passed out on the sidewalk. 
 Officer Fristed found an extremely intoxicated 59-year-old Green Valley 
 man whom were familiar with. When Officer Fristed informed him that he 
 would need to go to the hospital, the man expressed his gratitude with a 
 hearty,&quot;F*** you. The man got increasingly belligerent and Officer 
 O&apos;Hagan from Slinger PD was asked to assist. Jackson Fire Rescue was 
 dispatched to the scene and Acute Care Services was notified. When the 
 man refused to provide a urine sample, accompanied by more profanities, 
 a catheter was used. The man&apos;s blood-alcohol level was .40, too high for 
 him to be placed outside of a hospital setting. 

 At about 3:30 PM, a West Bend 
 man told Officer Foeger that a man had exposed himself to his 
 seven-year-old son at the skate park. However, further investigation by 
 Officer Foeger and assisting deputies revealed that a 16-year-old had 
 bent down to move the ramp and his pants came down slightly. Since he 
 was facing away, what the youngster saw was unintentional buttock 
 cleavage. 

 On October 6, Det. Bloedel 
 assisted two Department of Human Services workers in interviewing a 
 nine-year-old girl at the elementary school regarding possible 
 inappropriate contact by her mother&apos;s new boyfriend. 

 At 12:50 PM, Officers Gerke 
 and Friedl responded to Jackson Auto Service, where a 31-year-old 
 Mayville man was complaining about supposed damage done to his vehicle 
 when it was towed. The complainant had been arrested by the Sheriff&apos;s 
 Department for driving while revoked. The man&apos;s allegations were 
 unfounded and he was told that he should leave. The man stood next to 
 his friends vehicle and said that he wasn&apos;t going to leave until his 
 attorney told him it was okay to leave. Officer Gerke replied that he 
 had one last chance to leave or he would be arrested. The man stood 
 there, fidgeting with his cell phone and, true to her word, Officer 
 Gerke arrested him for disorderly conduct. 

 At 6:18 PM, Officer Gerke went 
 to the Ridge Road residence to talk to the 17-year-old about his 
 involvement in thefts of electronic items from vehicles. Her knocks went 
 on answered, but while standing at the back door she could smell burnt 
 marijuana. By telephone, the owner gave permission to enter. She and 
 Officer Henning entered the residence and followed the odor of marijuana 
 to a bedroom, where a 17-year-old and four other teenagers were found. 
 Marijuana and two pipes were found underneath the hosts dresser, and he 
 was arrested. 

 On October 7 at 5:49 PM, a 911 
 caller reported a possible intoxicated driver heading towards the 
 village on Highway 60 from Highway G. Officer Henning intercepted the 
 vehicle after it pulled into the Eastside Mart and parked diagonally, 
 blocking both a regular and a handicapped stall. Trooper Perales arrived 
 to take a written statement from the witness. Officer Henning contacted 
 the driver, a 33-year-old West Bend man, and noticed numerous open beer 
 cans in the back seat. The man didn&apos;t know his address or phone number, 
 and his speech was slow and slurred. The passenger, a 21-year-old West 
 Bend man, also did not know his address, was bobbing back and forth in 
 his seat as though he was going to fall asleep, and was unresponsive at 
 times. Deputy Survis arrived to assist. The driver failed field tests 
 and an alcohol screening was only .07%. However, the man had white 
 powder in a nostril and admitted to snorting Percocet. The man had three 
 previous OWI arrests and a revoked license, and was supposed to have an 
 ignition interlock device on any vehicle he operates. The passenger had 
 an even lower alcohol reading, .01%. When asked about blue residue in 
 his nose, the passenger said,&quot;it could be anything, like a blue (candy) 
 pixie stick&quot;. It was more likely related to the remains of crushed 
 narcotic pills that were found by the passenger seat. The driver was 
 arrested for his fourth offense of driving under the influence of drugs, 
 a felony. The passenger was arrested for two counts of felony bail 
 jumping, possession of drug paraphernalia, and fraudulent possession of 
 prescription drugs. 

 On October 8 at about 2:30 AM, 
 Officer Krueger observed a vehicle exit Walgreens and drive on Glen 
 Brooke Drive at a high rate of speed. After stopping the vehicle, he 
 spoke to the 22-year-old Town of Jackson woman, who said that she was 
 heading home after having just two beers at the Jackson Pub. Officer 
 Laabs arrived to assist. She failed field sobriety tests and was 
 arrested; the blood test was .16%. 

 At 12:41 PM, Officer Foeger 
 was dispatched to Hickory Park regarding parents who were involved in a 
 verbal argument over a soccer game between teams from Jackson and 
 Slinger. A Slinger woman reported that there was some confusion 
 regarding the eligibility of a girl who was going to play on her team, 
 and she decided to take the girl out of the game. This angered the 
 girl&apos;s parents, who allegedly called the woman a&quot;bitch&quot;and told her to&quot;go to hell&quot;. This account was verified by the referee and two other 
 adults, including the coach for the Jackson team. However, the 
 complainant did not want any further action taken. 

 At about 10:04 PM, Officer 
 Henning stopped a vehicle for rolling through a stop sign at the corner 
 of Stonewall and Highland. Inside the vehicle were two young men and a 
 young woman, all aged 17 and from the West Bend area. One of the men was 
 swaying to and fro in his seat. He said he hadn&apos;t been drinking, yet 
 almost fell when he got out of the truck and smelled of intoxicants. 
 When a field test revealed an alcohol reading of .08%, his reaction was&quot;I&apos;m f***ed. The young woman had a field test of .07%, but the driver 
 was clean and sober. When told that the teenagers had been drinking at 
 the homecoming dance at nearby Living Word Church and School, Officer 
 Krueger went there to inform administrators. The two who had been 
 drinking were both cited and released to their parents. 

 On October 9 at 1:45 PM, 
 Officer Foeger and Officer Fristed were dispatched to a local fast food 
 restaurant after a 23-year-old man called 911 to report that he had an 
 argument with his girlfriend, during which she drove over his foot. The 
 man told the officers that he and his girlfriend had been having trouble 
 since he had slept with another woman who was employed at another fast 
 food restaurant. When deciding where to go for lunch, she said she 
 didn&apos;t want to eat at that restaurant and allegedly punched him in the 
 arm. He pulled into a parking lot and got out to retrieve his skateboard 
 from the passenger side, and his girlfriend slid over to the driver seat 
 and drove off, running over his left foot; he declined medical 
 assistance. The 30-year-old woman denied driving over the man&apos;s foot and 
 punching him. She said that the man started using profanities in front 
 of her two sons, ages 12 and 6. Neither of them wanted to press charges 
 and they did not have a relationship that would trigger the mandatory 
 arrest statute, so no further action was taken. 

 On October 10 just before 7 
 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to an overdose at a Georgetown Drive 
 residence. He found that a 34-year-old woman appeared to be extremely 
 intoxicated and unable to speak. As Officer Henning tried to talk to 
 her, she fell down to the ground and began having a seizure, then 
 started foaming at the mouth, and finally went into unconsciousness. 
 Jackson Fire Rescue arrived. Family members reported that the woman 
 takes a wide variety of prescription narcotics and inhales household 
 cleaners. Prior to the rescue call, the woman was walking around and 
 talking to walls and objects. The overall residence was in a state of 
 squalor: the ground was littered with dirty clothes and garbage; the 
 kitchen area contained dirty plates and dishes; the house had a strong 
 putrid odor of animal feces; clothes, garbage and empty food containers 
 were piled up; and numerous doors couldn&apos;t be accessed due to the amount 
 of garbage and dirty laundry piled up. There were four children in the 
 house, ages toddler to 13. The woman was taken by rescue squad to the 
 hospital and Acute Care Services was notified regarding emergency 
 placement. A copy of the report was also sent to the Department of Human 
 Services for the protection of the children. 

 On October 11, Officer Friedl 
 and Investigator Bloedel were dispatched to the Jackson Motel. A week 
 earlier, a 28-year-old man had stolen a motorcycle from West Bend and 
 crashed on Highway 41 in Germantown. He was airlifted to Froedtert 
 Hospital by Flight for Life, then absconded and ended up at the motel. 
 The man was in such terrible condition that Jackson Fire Rescue was 
 dispatched to take him to St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital. Because of his 
 condition, the District Attorney asked that he not be taken into 
 custody. See October 12. 

 On the morning of October 12, 
 Officer Fristed met with Jackson Elementary Schools Principal. He 
 reported that a 46-year-old Town of Jackson woman, with whom we are 
 familiar, had told a teacher that she was mad at the school counselor 
 and wanted to hurt her, however she wouldn&apos;t because it would get her 
 into trouble. She said that she would protect her son and grandson, both 
 students, and would&quot;put a gun to somebody&apos;s head if they attempted to 
 hurt the boys&quot;. A conversation was held between the Principal, Officer 
 Fristed, and the woman. The reason for her anger cannot be discussed 
 here, but she understood that the comment was inappropriate. No further 
 action was taken. 

 Shortly after 5 PM, the 
 Sheriff Department advised that felony warrants had been issued for the 
 28-year-old man who&apos;d been taken to the hospital from the Jackson Motel 
 a day earlier. Officers Gerke and Foeger, along with Deputies Survis and 
 Robertson, returned to the motel, where the man surrendered without 
 incident. His medical condition was still bad enough that he needed 
 clearance at the hospital before being taken to County Jail. Once again, 
 Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched to the motel. Unfortunately, the man 
 made suicidal statements to his wife when she arrived at the hospital 
 with his prescriptions. Acute Care Services then had to be contacted, 
 and the worker concluded that the man needed to be involuntarily 
 committed. It took hours for ACS to find a facility that would accept 
 the man because of his crash injuries, with Officer Borkowski having to 
 stay at the hospital the entire time. Eventually a facility in Sheboygan 
 accepted him, and the Sheriff&apos;s Department handled the transport because 
 of the distance. 

 On October 14 at about 10 PM, 
 Officers Borkowski, Krueger and Foeger were dispatched to a Hemlock 
 Street apartment regarding a suicidal 42-year-old woman. The woman told 
 officers that she felt suicidal because her boyfriend left her when he 
 found out she was possibly pregnant; she took numerous Percocet and 
 Amoxicillin pills. Jackson Fire Rescue transported her to the hospital 
 for examination. The woman was cooperative and voluntarily went with an 
 ACS worker to an outpatient facility for the night. A friend agreed to 
 stay with her children. 

 On October 16 at 5:22 AM, 
 Officer Laabs assisted Slinger with a burglar alarm. 

 At 10:11 PM, a 45-year-old 
 Hemlock Street woman, with whom we are very familiar, reported that a 
 male friend had been constantly ringing her doorbell and broke the door 
 earlier in the evening after she asked him to leave. Officers Laabs and 
 Gerke found the man, with whom we are also familiar, sitting in front of 
 the door. He said there hadn&apos;t been any trouble, but the woman said that 
 he had been ringing the bell, calling her cell phone, and threatened to 
 drop a TV on the ground if she didn&apos;t answer the door. He was warned to 
 stay away from her and, because he had a field test of .24%, was given a 
 ride back to his Main Street residence. See October 29. 

 On October 17 at about 11 AM, 
 an employer asked for a welfare check of an employee with prior health 
 problems who had not reported for work. Detective Bloedel needed the 
 assistance of the Fire Department to enter the man&apos;s Spruce Street 
 apartment. Upon entering, he found the man lying on the floor of the 
 bathroom, obviously deceased. He also noticed that, although the 
 thermostat was set for a lower temperature, it was 95 in the apartment. 
 Ultimately, it was determined that this did not contribute to the 
 person&apos;s death, which was due to other serious medical problems. 

 At 5:47 PM, Officer Henning 
 assisted the Sheriff&apos;s Department with a burglar alarm in the Town of 
 Polk. 

 At about 6:21 PM, a concerned 
 resident reported that a fox was sitting on the steps of the former 
 Jackson Mill; the caller thought that this could be dangerous. This was 
 the first of many reports of one or two foxes in the village, which is 
 not a danger. 

 At 4:23 PM, Officers Henning 
 and Fristed were dispatched to a family trouble call at a Highway P 
 residence. The couple had gotten into an argument regarding parental 
 discipline. The wife was upset that her husband was refusing to leave 
 for the night, but the officers said they couldn&apos;t force them to leave. 
 However after further discussion he did agree to pick up some belongings 
 and leave. See October 19. 

 On October 18, an employee of 
 an organization that supports concealed weapons carry reported that 
 someone claiming to be against concealed carry had called and threatened 
 to&quot;come over and blow your brains out&quot;. The origin of the call could 
 not be determined. 

 On October 19 after 4 PM, 
 Officers Henning and Fristed returned to the Highway P residence 
 regarding another family trouble. This time, the 34-year-old husband 
 complained that his wife had hidden his unemployment check and wouldn&apos;t 
 return it. The wife told Officer Henning that she no longer had the 
 check, having written&quot;return to sender&quot;over the address and dropping 
 it off at the post office. 

 On October 24 at 7:14 PM, 
 Officer Gerke and Deputy Killey responded to a 911 call of a family 
 fight at a Westfield Drive home. The 45-year-old woman was arrested for 
 slapping her husband twice and her husband was referred to the District 
 Attorney for disorderly conduct.  

 At 8:50 PM, a Chestnut Court 
 woman reported that her estranged husband entered her apartment with the 
 key and took the television. After being told that this was a civil 
 matter and the police would not be sent, the woman called back and said 
 that the man had actually broken in. After arriving, Officer Gerke was 
 told that the man had moved out at the end of September. When the 
 complainant returned home, she noticed that the television, aquarium and 
 other miscellaneous items had been removed. She explained that she 
 assumed he used his key to enter but then discovered damage to the door 
 and frame from being kicked. Neighbors verified hearing the sound of 
 this break-in and seeing the man and an unknown woman carrying property 
 out of the apartment. The following day, the suspect contacted Officer 
 Gerke by phone. He said he that he used his key to enter and the damage 
 had been done by his wife in an earlier incident that had been reported. 
 Since this was marital property, no theft had taken place. 

 On October 25 at 12:22 PM, 
 Officer Gerke assisted a Deputy on a traffic stop in which the driver 
 was wanted on a $10,000 warrant from Sheboygan County. 

 On October 27, shortly before 
 4 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to a Green Valley residence. 
 Officers have been to this location several times this year because of 
 ongoing conflicts between a woman and her mother-in-law. In this case, 
 the 62-year-old woman was cited for disorderly conduct for yelling F*** 
 you at her daughter-in-law, in the presence of her two grandchildren. 

 On the afternoon of October 
 29, the Hemlock Street woman told Officer Friedl that she&apos;d heard 
 nothing from her ex-boyfriend since she rejected his entreaties for 
 reconciliation. She wanted the officer to check the man&apos;s residence 
 because he might hurt himself. Officer Friedl checked and found that the 
 man wasn&apos;t home and couldn&apos;t be located. 

 At 6:11 PM, Officer Henning 
 responded to a rescue call at a Hemlock Street apartment, where a 
 27-year-old man was possibly having a seizure. His 29-year-old 
 girlfriend reported that she&apos;d been sleeping on the couch and woke to 
 see her boyfriend convulsing. While Jackson Fire Rescue was working on 
 the man, Officer Henning observed a marijuana pipe sitting on the desk. 
 Looking around, he saw view dozens of prescription pill bottles with 
 labels that had been torn off and methadone. The woman was arrested for 
 possession of a Schedule II narcotic and paraphernalia. The man was 
 transported to the hospital and a hold was placed on him by Probation 
 and Parole. 

 

 September 2011 

   

 Jackson officers assisted the Fire 
 Department at twelve rescue and fire calls this month. 

 On September 1 at about 1:05 PM, 
 Germantown PD asked Officer Friedl to inspect a dump truck that had lost 
 portions of its tire, causing it to roll over on Highway 41. 

 At 4:15 PM, Officers Gerke and Henning 
 responded to a residence where a woman reported that a 13-year-old 
 neighbor girl was seeking refuge from her mother. The girl told Officer 
 Gerke that her mother had struck her in the face with a power cord, 
 grabbed her by the hair, and slapped the back of her head. When 
 interviewed at the police department, the mother said that she had been 
 having discipline problems with the girl. When the girl turned the radio 
 off too loudly, Mom said she yanked on the power cord and it may have 
 accidentally struck the girl. After further investigation, including the 
 involvement of a County social worker, the woman was arrested. The girl 
 and two siblings were turned over to the care of a relative. See 
 September 14. 

 On September 2 at about 7 PM, a 
 Ridgeway Drive man told Officer Henning that his wife was refusing to 
 return their two children in violation of a custody agreement. When 
 contacted, the woman was uncooperative but eventually returned the 
 children. 

 At 7:30 PM, a Sheboygan man complained 
 to Officer Gerke that the mother of his children was not complying with 
 the visitation arrangements. Since the agreement came out of Sheboygan 
 County, and Jackson was just the meeting place, he was told to contact 
 that court system for this civil matter. 

 On September 3 at 5:38 AM, the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department asked Officer Laabs to check on a downed tree on 
 Jackson Drive south of the village limits. 

 At 8:24 PM, an abandoned 911 call was 
 made from a Wilshire Drive residence where there had been previous 
 family trouble calls. Officers Foeger and Henning responded and spoke to 
 the couple. The husband reported that his wife had returned intoxicated 
 and refused to blow into a breath testing device he had purchased. Words 
 were exchanged and a telephone was thrown. When questioned, the woman 
 denied having anything to drink although she appeared to be extremely 
 intoxicated. The woman was cautioned that she needed to get counseling 
 for her alcoholism and that there was a high probability that if these 
 confrontations continued, the elements of domestic violence would 
 eventually be met and someone would be arrested. 

 On September 4 at about 2:30 PM, an 
 Illinois man told Officer Henning that his daughters ex-fianc had 
 punched and destroyed the rearview mirror inside of her car. This came 
 after his daughter broke off the engagement. After interviewing the 
 22-year-old at her Chestnut Court apartment, the officers made contact 
 with the suspect at his grandparents home. He was found with a bandaged 
 and bleeding hand. He was arrested for domestic violence and also held 
 on a probation violation. 

 On September 5 at 1:14 AM, Officers 
 Borkowski and Foeger were dispatched to a fight at the Jackson Pub. 
 Officers from the Sheriff&apos;s Department, State Patrol, and Slinger PD 
 assisted. A 36-year-old Hartford area man had been attacked by several 
 individuals, all of whom were intoxicated and supposedly members of a 
 motorcycle gang. Ultimately, a Milwaukee man and a West Bend man, both 
 in their 30s, were cited for disorderly conduct. 

 At about the same time as the tavern 
 fight, a Chestnut Court woman requested the police for a family trouble 
 matter. Deputy Stolz made contact with her by telephone and determined 
 that this had only been a verbal confrontation. At about 2:23 AM, our 
 officers met with the complainant and his wife. They were told that the 
 couple had been arguing earlier that night and the husband had walked 
 off to cool down. He&apos;d been gone for about 15 minutes when his wife 
 started calling his cell phone, asking for her car keys. When he 
 returned home he got upset because she had left the lights on in her 
 car, which would have made it impossible for her to go to work the next 
 day. Then another argument ensued over who had the keys and who could 
 have the laptop computer. The man had just returned from military 
 service in Iraq. It was suggested that they seek counseling, possibly 
 through the VA, and separate for the evening to avoid a more serious 
 problem. 

 At 12:30 PM, a 44-year-old Grafton man 
 told Officer Fristed that his motorcycle had been stolen from outside 
 the Latest Edition. The motorcycle was recovered about a week later from 
 a detention pond in the nearby industrial Park. 

 At 9:04 PM, Slinger PD requested 
 assistance on a traffic stop in which a passenger was wanted; Officer 
 Foeger responded. 

 On September 6 at 5:33 PM, the 
 Sheriffs Department requested mutual aid from Officer Foeger to assist 
 their officers at a burglar alarm at a factory in the Town of Polk. 

 On September 7 at about 4 PM, a 
 Ridgeway Drive man told Officer Friedl that a dump truck had struck his 
 vehicle, and after exchanging some limited information everyone left the 
 scene. The man now had second thoughts about not getting complete 
 identification of the trucking company and its driver. Officer Friedl 
 spent several days following-up on the limited information available but 
 was eventually able to identify the driver and the company. The driver 
 was cited for inattentive driving and failure to report an accident. 

 At 7:39 PM, a 10-year-old boy told 
 Officer Foeger that his skateboard had been stolen at the skate park at 
 Jackson Park by several youths whom he thought he recognized. However, 
 the boy could not make a positive identification and further 
 investigation was fruitless. 

 On September 8 at 11:45 AM, Officer 
 Gerke was called to West Bend East High School where a student claimed 
 that an older brother had deliberately burned him. However, as he was 
 interviewed by the officer and a social worker his story changed several 
 times. It was possible that he had actually burned himself. 

 At about 4 PM, a person reported two 
 intoxicated subjects walking and stumbling on Ridgeway Drive. Officer 
 Foeger found a 17-year-old Chestnut Court man and a 16-year-old Ridgeway 
 Court youth. The two were not intoxicated but when they were patted down 
 for weapons, they were found to be in possession of marijuana and 
 paraphernalia. They were both arrested and cited. 

 On September 9 at 9:30 PM, Officers 
 Henning and Krueger were dispatched to a family trouble at a Georgetown 
 Drive apartment, where a 13-year-old complained that he had been slapped 
 in the face by his father. Dad replied that he did so because the 
 teenager was smarting off to his parents. There is tension in the house 
 because the boy wants to live in another state with his mother. 

 On September 11 at about 7 PM, Officer 
 Friedl assisted the Sheriffs Department at a rollover accident on 
 Mayfield Road north of Highway 60. 

 At 8:11 PM, Officers Gerke and Krueger 
 were dispatched to a family fight at a Main Street residence. A 
 17-year-old woman said that she and her older sister are extremely upset 
 because they miss their father, who has just been sentenced to jail for 
 a sexual assault. Their mother blamed the older sisters boyfriend, a 
 20-year-old who lives with the family awaiting the birth of his child, 
 and started yelling at him. The mother says that the boyfriend had 
 gotten an attitude with her, and she told him and the daughter to get 
 out of the house. Some degree of peace was restored for the evening. 

 On September 12 at 3:40 PM, Officer 
 Fristed responded to a rescue call at a Hunters Road residence, where a 
 19-year-old girl was feeling the after-effects of smoking an unknown 
 substance at another home. When Officer Fristed tried to make contact at 
 that residence, the people inside refused to answer the door. When 
 interviewed two days later, a 17-year-old resident gave various 
 explanations about what might have taken place and denied supplying the 
 substance. He was told of the potential consequences had permanent 
 injury been done to the victim, and his mother was also made aware of 
 what happened. 

 At about 8 PM, a Hemlock Street man 
 told Officer Foeger that he was having ongoing problems with an 
 11-year-old neighbor boy who is using profanities towards other children 
 in the apartment complex (none of which can be repeated here). 

 On September 13 at about 1:30 AM, 
 Officer Laabs was monitoring three individuals who were walking on Glen 
 Brooke Drive. A resident then reported that they had just&quot;flipped him 
 the finger&quot;and he would appreciate it if Officer Laabs would keep an 
 eye on his car. He found five young men sitting at a picnic table 
 outside the Village Mart. Two of them, both from Milwaukee, were wanted 
 for questioning by the Sheriff&apos;s Department regarding thefts from 
 vehicles, and several deputies arrived to talk to them. The others were 
 another Milwaukee man, an 18-year-old from Woodshire Court and an 
 18-year-old from West Bend. As will be reported next month, the Jackson 
 and West Bend men were arrested for stealing from vehicles. 

 On September 14 at 8:15 PM, a resident 
 reported having ongoing problems with the two younger siblings of the 
 teenage girl who had been physically abused by her mother on September 
 1. The children were allegedly harassing the complainant&apos;s own child, 
 while they accused that girl of harassing them. Everyone was warned to 
 behave. See September 17. 

 On September 17 at about 2:18 AM, 
 Officers Borkowski and Laabs were dispatched to the Jackson Pub 
 regarding someone slashing tires in the parking lot. Several witnesses 
 provided a description to Officer Borkowski while Officer Laabs searched 
 the area for the person who had fled on foot. An employee told Officer 
 Borkowski that a verbal confrontation had broken out at an outside 
 patio, and there was pushing and shoving. A patron eventually gave up 
 the name of the suspect, a 21-year-old Town of Jackson man. At about 3 
 AM, the man turned himself in to the officers. He said that he had been 
 hit in the face during the fracas on the patio, slashed two front tires 
 of a car that he thought belonged to his assailants (it didnt), and 
 then fled. The identities of the people who hit him were never 
 established. The man was cited for damage to property. 

 At 5:18 PM, a 40-year-old man asked to 
 speak to an officer about filing charges against the woman in the child 
 abuse case for allegedly walking past his home and calling him an 
 obscenity. The man said that he had been closing his garage door when he 
 heard a woman speak. He turned and saw this woman and said,&quot;excuse me? 
 to which the woman responded that she had nothing to say to him and then 
 swore and called him a liar. She allegedly continued yelling at him as 
 she walked towards her own house. The neighbor said that the only thing 
 he heard was the woman saying something to the effect of,&quot;you are not a 
 holy roller and you don&apos;t own the neighborhood&quot;. This apparently was the 
 result of the man repeating gossip about the incident that happened 
 earlier in the month. The woman told Officer Gerke that she did tell the 
 man that she had nothing to say to him and he began making accusations 
 about her children. It was only then that she accused the man of being a 
 liar and swore at him. She said that she keeps her children from walking 
 on the sidewalk in front of the man&apos;s residence and indicated that she 
 might get a restraining order against him. 

 On September 19 at 7:40 AM, a Ridgeway 
 Court man told Officer Friedl that he couldn&apos;t get his 13-year-old son 
 to go to school. Officer Friedl told the boy to get ready now and 
 suggested that the father take control. 

 On September 20 at 8:30 PM, a resident 
 reported an audible alarm going off at an abandoned factory building. 
 Officer Krueger and Trooper Perales responded and found that one door 
 had been left unlocked, but no one was inside. A key holder arrived and 
 didn&apos;t see anything out of the ordinary. 

 On September 21 at about 7 PM, a 
 passerby reported that copper cable had been stolen, and damage done, to 
 the factory building in the previous incident. Although power had been 
 cut off to the building, WE Energies reported that it was still possible 
 that cutting the cable had activated the fire alarm heard the previous 
 night. 

 At about 8 PM, Officer Borkowski dealt 
 with yet another estranged couple who were exchanging angry text 
 messages about child support and visitation. 

 On September 22 at about 7:44 PM, a 
 23-year-old Hickory Lane woman told Officer Foeger that her live-in 
 boyfriend was acting strangely and wouldn&apos;t let her into the apartment 
 to retrieve her property. The two had been having problems, so she was 
 now living elsewhere and needed to get items for her children. The man 
 refused to come to the door for Officer Foeger, as well. The man was 
 currently wanted on warrants from the Sheriff&apos;s Department for a prior 
 domestic abuse charge involving the same woman. Chief Dolnick called the 
 man and asked if his refusal to open the door was because he was afraid 
 of going to jail on the warrants; the man said it was. Chief Dolnick 
 asked the man if he would agree to vacate the premises by 5 PM so his 
 girlfriend could get the necessary items for their children; he did. He 
 was told to contact his public defender about the warrants. Although 
 this meant not arresting the man on the warrants, it did resolve the 
 immediate problem for the children. 

 On September 23, the West Fargo, North 
 Dakota Police Department informed Det. Bloedel that it were looking for 
 property that had been stolen and possibly transported to a Green Valley 
 residence. After considerable follow-up, he recovered the property and 
 verified the identity of the suspect. Further charges from West Fargo 
 may be pending. 

 On the morning of September 25, 
 Officer Gerke was on routine patrol and discovered obscenities had been 
 sprayed with purple paint at the DNR property on Hasmer Lake. 

 On the morning of September 26, 
 employees at the Piggly Wiggly reported a possible homeless person in 
 the vicinity. She and Deputy Essinger walked towards a wooded area 
 behind Ivy Manor that is divided between the village and township. They 
 were met by a man walking out of the woods, who claimed he had recently 
 gotten out of the Ozaukee County Jail. However in speaking to the man, 
 he claimed not to know his last address, phone number, mother and 
 fathers names, the names of any school he ever attended or any place he 
 had ever worked. It was unknown if this person was deliberately lying or 
 was suffering a mental illness. He was arrested for obstructing and 
 trespassing, and taken to the Washington County Jail so his fingerprints 
 could be scanned. He was eventually identified as a 39-year-old man with 
 arrests in Arizona and Minnesota. Authorities in Ozaukee County said 
 that he had been exhibiting signs of delusion and talking to people and 
 things that were not present, and they believed that he was 
 schizophrenic and not taking medication. Arrangements were made with ACS 
 to intervene when the man was released because he was homeless and 
 possibly mentally ill. As anticipated, the District Attorney declined to 
 prosecute the man, which facilitated getting him assistance. 

 At about noon, the owner of another 
 factory building told Officer Gerke that he&apos;d found a cell phone in the 
 grass next to one of their buildings that might be related to some 
 thefts that have been occurring there. The phone was right next to a 
 door that was unlocked the last time the building was entered. Although 
 nothing appeared to be missing from the building, there were signs that 
 kids had been skateboarding, a door had been damaged, and a fire 
 extinguisher had been activated. Following up on investigative leads 
 provided by the cell phone, Officer Gerke was able to identify the 
 teenagers who had been inside the building. The owner was willing not to 
 have citations issued as long as restitution was made for the damage and 
 the fire extinguisher. 

 That afternoon, a Ridgeway Drive man 
 told Officer Foeger that he was fed up with a neighbor who was harassing 
 him because he has posted antiunion signs by his house. This upset the 
 neighbor, who is an active union member and feels that the other man is 
 being disrespectful. He claimed that the only thing he ever yells at him 
 is&quot;scab&quot;, and countered that the complainant has been on his property, 
 banging on the door. The man was told to stop yelling things at the 
 complainant and the complainant was told to stay off of the neighbor&apos;s 
 property. 

 At about 7 PM, Officer Foeger went to 
 a Center Street apartment building after neighbors complained that a 
 53-year-old woman and her teenage daughter were yelling at each other 
 about doing the laundry. 

 Shortly after 8 PM, a vehicle 
 belonging to an Oakwood Drive man was found abandoned on Jackson Drive 
 after jumping the curb and striking a steel dumpster with enough force 
 to deploy both airbags. The man was eventually came to the police 
 station but refused to answer questions. Officer Borkowski cited him for 
 hit and run and failure to report an accident. 

 On September 27 at about 12:30 AM, an 
 Oakland Drive woman reported to Officer Borkowski that she was receiving 
 vulgar and threatening text messages from her girlfriends ex-husband. 
 The messages had begun at about 8 PM and didn&apos;t stop until 12:12 AM. She 
 texted back several times, asking him to please stop, but he refused to. 
 The complainant&apos;s friend explained that she didn&apos;t get upset by her 
 ex-husband&apos;s antics, so he started targeting the other woman. Officer 
 Borkowski called the man at a residence in Crivitz and was connected 
 with his sister. She attempted to explain to the woman why she was 
 calling in the middle of the night, but the woman kept yelling at her 
 and wouldn&apos;t let Officer Borkowski get a word in. Eventually Officer 
 Borkowski warned her that if she could not speak civilly, she would hang 
 up. The woman continued to yell, so Officer Borkowski said goodnight and 
 hung up. Chief Dolnick returned the woman&apos;s call the next morning and 
 tried to explain why Officer Borkowski called in the middle of the 
 night. However, the woman kept yelling at him, and he also ended the 
 conversation. 

 At about 11:30 AM, Officer Gerke and 
 Chief Dolnick went to a residence where a woman wanted her 19-year-old 
 daughter removed from the residence because she was out of control. 

 At about 6:30 PM, a 15-year-old boy 
 was struck by a vehicle at the intersection of Jackson Drive at 
 Crestview Drive; the boy had a sore wrist and the bike was damaged. A 
 woman in her 50s or 60s had cut the corner too close when making a 
 left-hand turn, struck the bicycle, and kept driving. Because the 
 vehicle was missing its back plate, he was not able to get the number. 
 It was possible that the driver wasn&apos;t aware of the accident. 

 On September 29 at about 7:30 PM, a 
 cell phone caller reported a possible intoxicated driver heading towards 
 the village from Slinger. She reported that the vehicle crossed the 
 center line into oncoming traffic and was continuing to swerve badly. 
 Officer Gerke was able to intercept the vehicle as it entered the 
 village, and she also noticed it swerving. She was surprised to see that 
 it was a 53-year-old Slinger man who had been involved in a traffic 
 accident only two hours earlier. At that point, he had not been drinking 
 and was sober. However, he apparently had gone home and started drinking 
 heavily, for his speech was now slurred and he failed the field sobriety 
 tests badly; the blood test was .29%. 

 At about 11 PM, Officers Gerke and 
 Krueger responded to a Ridge Road home where a 30-year-old woman 
 reported that she had been shoved by her husband. The woman reported 
 that the two of them had gone out to eat and began fighting on their way 
 home. At one point she told her husband that she wanted to get out of 
 the car but he wouldn&apos;t let her. She said that the husband grabbed the 
 collar of her shirt and held her head towards the dashboard to prevent 
 her from leaving. As they came to a stop on the off ramp of the highway, 
 she got out of the vehicle, kicked the car, and started walking home. 
 Later, she was upset that her necklace was broken and she couldn&apos;t 
 locate her car keys. She went into the bedroom and slapped her husband, 
 telling him to give her,&quot;the God damned keys&quot;. He refused, and she 
 knocked items off the dresser. He then allegedly pushed her out the 
 bedroom causing her to fall and strike her head on a wall. The husbands 
 story basically matched his wife&apos;s, except saying that the altercation 
 in the bedroom occurred because she would not let him leave. Ultimately, 
 both subjects were arrested for disorderly conduct/domestic violence. 

 

 August 2011 

 Jackson officers assisted the fire 
 department at ten rescue and fire calls in August. 

 On August 1 at 
 about 1 PM, Officer Gerke, Det. Bloedel, and Chief Dolnick responded to 
 the backyard of a Main Street residence, where a 34-year-old man was 
 passed out drunk. The man, who is well known to us, was laying in the 
 grass, in the hot sun, with a temperature almost 90 with tropical 
 humidity. Jackson Fire Rescue determined that he had a rapid heart beat 
 and was dehydrated. He was taken to the hospital for medical clearance, 
 where a blood test revealed his alcohol level was .36%. He was then 
 transported by Officer Gerke to the County Jail for violating an 
 absolute sobriety condition on bond for a previous criminal arrest in 
 the village. 

 At 2:30 PM, a 
 South Street woman told Officer Foeger that an Allenton man kept sending 
 her text messages claiming that her current boyfriend was having an 
 affair with her best friend. The suspect formerly dated this friend and 
 had allegedly been physically and verbally abusive to her. The 
 45-year-old man was warned to leave the woman alone or he would be cited 
 for harassment. 

 On August 5 at 10 
 PM, Officer Henning stopped a vehicle that seemed to be driving 
 aimlessly through residential neighborhoods and in the area of Living 
 Word Church. He stopped the vehicle as it pulled into Eastside Mart, and 
 spoke to the driver, a 34-year-old West Milwaukee man. He claimed to be 
 on his way home from work at Quadgraphics and had made only one stop, 
 that being in Slinger to visit a friend&quot;who is Polish&quot;. When challenged 
 about why he was driving through apartment complexes in Jackson, he 
 claimed to have stopped at a friend&apos;s house. Officer Henning noticed 
 that the man was pale, his reactions were slowed, and the pupils of his 
 eyes were constricted. The man admitted to taking muscle relaxer. The 
 man pulled out a variety of prescriptions and a pill bottle that 
 contained a snorting straw. The man claimed that he snorted instead of 
 swallowing because it works faster. During a pat-down for contraband the 
 man admitted that he had OxyContin in his sock. The man was arrested on 
 charges of possession of a Schedule II substance and drug paraphernalia. 

 On August 6 
 shortly after midnight, a Green Valley man told Officer Foeger that an 
 unknown man called and told him that if he didnt get $20,000 he would 
 send four guys over in a Cadillac. 

 At about 3:30 AM, 
 Officer Krueger responded to a mutual aid request from Slinger PD for a 
 family fight. 

 On August 7 at 3 
 PM, a 16-year-old Green Valley youth told Officer Henning that his 
 father had been threatened by the neighbor. The father does not speak 
 English, and his son reported that the 58-year-old next-door neighbor 
 kicked over a turtle cage that was allegedly on the lot line, struck one 
 of the fathers plants, and said such things as,&quot;speak English&quot;,&quot;go 
 back to your country&quot;, and&quot;you don&apos;t have a yard; your yard is in 
 Mexico&quot;. When interviewed, the man admitted telling Father and Son that 
 they should go back to Mexico where they can speak Spanish. The man was 
 extremely agitated and made ridiculous comments about getting a past 
 County Sheriff fired for perjury and that he was not someone to be 
 messed with. Nevertheless, Officer Henning cited the man for disorderly 
 conduct. 

 At 9 PM, Officer 
 Henning was dispatched to the intersection of Raymond Road and Francis 
 Drive regarding a car that struck a tree. He found the car had struck 
 and broken off the tree at its base, continued through a yard and 
 driveway, and came to rest partially on the street. The 50-year-old 
 driver lived close to the accident scene; she told Officer Henning that 
 she had some wine at dinner as well as several doses of Percocet. He 
 noticed that her actions were slow, she was sweating, and her speech was 
 slow and slurred. Officer O&apos;Hagan from the Slinger PD arrived to assist. 
 The woman failed field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving while 
 under the influence of drugs. 

 At 10:46 PM, 
 Officer Laabs was dispatched to a South Street residence, where a 
 20-year-old woman reported that she was receiving harassing phone and 
 text messages from a Marinette man. The messages started out by calling 
 her a&quot;slut&quot;. The man called while Officer Laabs was at the house, so he 
 answered the phone and identified himself as a police officer. The man 
 kept yelling at Officer Laabs and claimed that&quot;a friend&quot;was actually 
 responsible. The man continued to send messages claiming that various 
 police officers wanted to talk to her. He was tracked down to a trailer 
 park in Marinette. Although the man told the complainant that his mother&quot;works for a prestige law firm and can get rid of tickets&quot;, his record 
 of convictions says otherwise. Officer Laabs was going to cite the man 
 for disorderly conduct but the complainant asked him not to. 

 On August 8, a 
 local business told Officer Henning that an employee had been using a 
 company credit card to steal gasoline to use in his own car. After a 
 lengthy investigation, the man was issued citations for fraudulent use 
 of credit cards and restitution for approximately $1,800 in stolen fuel. 

 At 6:20 PM, a 
 36-year-old man, who we are very familiar with, said that his daughter 
 had been bitten by her mother&apos;s cat and he was afraid the bite was going 
 to be infected. However, he did not take the four-year-old to the 
 doctor. Officer Fristed contacted Mom and found that the cat was not 
 currently vaccinated for rabies. Consequently, he quarantined it at the 
 Humane Society. See August 9. 

 At 7:46 PM, 
 Officer Henning assisted a 61-year-old homeless man who was loitering at 
 the McDonald&apos;s parking lot. A social service agency provided a voucher 
 so the man could spend the night at a West Bend motel. 

 On August 9 at 
 3:12 AM, Officer Borkowski and Officer Laabs were dispatched to check 
 the welfare of a 21-year-old Scot Court woman who started screaming 
 while on the phone with her boyfriend. However, she told the officers 
 that the complainant was actually her EX-boyfriend and she didn&apos;t want 
 to talk to him at three o&apos;clock in the morning or any other time. When 
 told not to call her again, he replied,&quot;then Ill just f***ing leave 
 her alone. 

 At 8:30 AM, the 
 father of the four-year-old told Officer Friedl that he wanted&quot;documentation&quot;that the girl&apos;s mother failed to confirm a doctors 
 appointment that he had made for the girl. The mother told Officer 
 Friedl that she is a registered nurse and was keeping an eye on the 
 wound and would obviously take the little girl to see a physician if 
 there was a need to do so. The man became argumentative when told that 
 there was nothing to be documented and Officer Friedl eventually hung up 
 on them. Shortly after, Chief Dolnick sent the man written notification 
 that we would no longer document unfounded allegations or civil disputes 
 with this woman. 

 At 2:22 PM, 
 Officer Fristed detained a 67-year-old resident and held him for arrest 
 by a Hartford police officer regarding indecent exposure. 

 At 4:39 PM, 
 Officer Henning stopped a vehicle on Highway 45 that was registered to a 
 revoked driver. While speaking to the driver, a 28-year-old Town of 
 Barton man, he observed a clear plastic sandwich bag tied in a small 
 knot in one corner. Based upon his training and experience, Officer 
 Henning knew that such bags are often used to package drugs. The driver 
 and his passenger, his twin brother, claimed the bag was left in the car 
 by its previous owner. Officer Fristed arrived to assist. The driver was 
 found to be in possession of unprescribed Xanax and was arrested. A 
 search of the vehicle revealed another sandwich bag that contained a 
 variety of different prescription medications. The driver was cited for 
 driving while suspended, operating without insurance, and possession of 
 drug paraphernalia. The District Attorney was asked to charge him with 
 several counts of possession of controlled substances and narcotics. His 
 twin brother was wanted by the Sheriff&apos;s Department on a warrant and 
 also arrested. 

 At 8:06 PM, a 
 66-year-old Green Valley woman told Officer Henning that she had met 
 someone on a Christian dating website and began an e-mail relationship. 
 The man identified himself as&quot;John Brown&quot;from Nigeria. At one point, 
 John asked for money so he could leave Nigeria. Although a relative had 
 found John&apos;s profile picture with different names attached to it on 
 other websites, she refused to believe that it was a scam and wired 
 $450. John then emailed that he needed more, and at that point she 
 realized it was a fraud and she contacted us. Its impossible to 
 identify the person, his location, and where the money went. 

 On August 14 at 
 2:40 AM, Officer Laabs and Officer Krueger were dispatched to the area 
 of Georgetown and Park Court regarding a fight. Upon arrival, the 
 officers could hear a verbal argument in the backyard of a Georgetown 
 Drive residence. While talking to an intoxicated 27-year-old man, 
 Officer Laabs saw two other intoxicated men going nose to nose verbally. 
 Then, a 29-year-old woman started screaming while in the garage. Further 
 investigation revealed that she had a gash on her head after a woman hit 
 her with a flashlight. Then, one of the intoxicated men who had been&quot;nose to nose&quot;headed for the garage to resume his fight with his dance 
 partner. Officer Laabs intercepted him, and everyone was directed to 
 assemble in an adjacent backyard. Due to the number of disorderly, 
 intoxicated people, the Sheriff&apos;s Department sent a Lieutenant and three 
 deputies to assist. In the meantime, Jackson Fire Rescue arrived to 
 treat the injured woman. Basically, this was a fight between intoxicated 
 neighbors. Ultimately, a 31-year-old Park Court man was arrested for 
 disorderly conduct, and his girlfriend was arrested for battery. The 
 31-year-old Georgetown Drive woman who was hit with the flashlight was 
 arrested for disorderly conduct, for yelling racial slurs at her 
 attackers 12-year-old daughter and telling her that she was going to 
 be flat-chested and would need a boob job like her mom (which provoked 
 the flashlight attack). See next. 

 At 7:40 AM, 
 Officer Friedl returned to Georgetown Drive because the Park Court man 
 had bailed out of jail and immediately returned to pick a fight with his 
 neighbors. He was arrested for disorderly conduct and bail jumping. 

 At 3:03 PM, the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department received a cell phone report of an intoxicated 
 driver who had just pulled into the Main Street Mart. As Officer Henning 
 arrived, he observed a 41-year-old Germantown woman staggering as she 
 exited the vehicle. Officer Garro from Slinger PD arrived to assist. The 
 woman had bloodshot eyes and her speech was slow and slurred. Although 
 he could smell intoxicants on her breath, she claimed not to have 
 consumed alcohol; she did admit to taking muscle relaxers and blood 
 pressure medicine. After further questioning she admitted to having two 
 vodka lemonades. The woman failed field sobriety tests and was arrested 
 for her third offense. After blood was drawn she was held at the County 
 Jail; the blood test was .30%. The witness was an off-duty Milwaukee 
 firefighter who reported that the woman was swerving badly, speeding up 
 and slowing down, and almost sideswiped his vehicle. 

 On August 15 at 
 7:10 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to a Main Street residence after 
 an off-duty Hartford detective observed a man throwing objects and 
 arguing with two women on a porch. The woman told him that the 
 37-year-old man, who resides with one of the women, had come home from 
 work angry, throwing things around, and gone inside the home. Because 
 she reported that there were firearms inside the residence, Officer 
 Henning requested assistance from Slinger and the Sheriff&apos;s Department. 
 Two officers stopped traffic on Main Street while Officer Henning and a 
 deputy made contact with the man; the man refused to communicate. 
 Officer Henning circled around to the back and observed the man outside, 
 gave him a verbal commands, and took him into custody without incident. 
 The man had thrown and destroyed a lawn chair and end table. He was 
 arrested for disorderly conduct and damage to property (domestic 
 violence). 

 On August 16 at 
 10:15 AM, a White Oak Circle woman reported that her 89-year-old mother 
 had gone missing 45 minutes earlier and could not be located. An 
 hour-long search by Officer Friedl, Det. Bloedel, and Public Works 
 employees was unsuccessful. Officer Friedl requested assistance from the 
 Fire Department and they had just assembled to do a search of nearby 
 wooded areas when Det. Bloedel spotted the woman near Hickory Park. The 
 woman said that she was mad at her daughter, decided to take a long walk 
 and was sorry for the commotion. 

 On August 17 at 
 6:24 PM, Officers Henning, Foeger, and Fristed were dispatched to a 
 family fight at a Valley Drive residence. This turned out to be an 
 argument between estranged spouses, aggravated by the intoxication of 
 the soon-to-be divorced husband. No arrest was justified but the adults 
 were cautioned about further incidents. Officers Henning and Foeger were 
 sent back to the house after a 911 hang-up was made from the house, but 
 the woman had accidentally hit&quot;redial&quot;from the first incident. 

 On August 18 at 
 11 AM, a resident of a condominium association complained about a man 
 who constantly parked his vehicle on their private road and trespassed 
 with his dog. They had told the man several times that he was on private 
 property, but he was belligerent and kept doing it. The 69-year-old man 
 apparently didn&apos;t believe them until Officer Friedl stopped at his home 
 to have a chat. 

 On August 20, 
 Officer Gerke was on routine patrol when she noticed a cat in the window 
 of a Hickory Lane home. Earlier this summer, Officer Gerke had 
 investigated the owners of the house for hoarding cats. Ultimately, the 
 Humane Society had removed 20 cats, with nine having to be euthanized 
 due to illness or being severely feral. The home was almost condemned 
 because of the damage and stench caused by the cats, but it had been 
 successfully rehabbed by the owners. Officer Gerke was familiar with the 
 two cats that are licensed for the residence, and the cat she saw was a 
 different one. One of the owners refused to allow her inside the home 
 but insisted that only the two licensed cats were in the house, one of 
 which was the one she saw in the window. However, in checking with area 
 veterinarians Officer Gerke determined that this was a different cat. 
 She also discovered that the owners had falsified the licensing 
 applications for the two&quot;legal&quot;cats by claiming they had been 
 vaccinated for rabies; the clinics named never treated those cats. 
 Citations for obstructing, keeping unlicensed cats, and a zoning 
 violation were issued. 

 On August 22 at 
 2:25 AM, a Hemlock Street woman called 911 because her ex-boyfriend was 
 driving a car without insurance. Officer Krueger warned her that she 
 would be cited if she used 911 for that again. 

 At 3:37 PM, a 
 31-year-old Chestnut Court woman came to the police department to report 
 that she had been punched in the face by her live-in boyfriend who was 
 now riding a bicycle. While Officer Gerke interviewed the victim at the 
 police station, Det. Bloedel and Chief Dolnick went to the area to 
 locate the suspect. Chief Dolnick spotted the man on his bicycle on 
 Georgetown Drive at Ridgeway Drive and, with Detective Bloedel, stopped 
 him at the curb. The man smelled of intoxicants and said nothing had 
 happened at home. Det. Bloedel observed fresh marks on the man&apos;s face, 
 which the man insisted were old scars from a motorcycle accident. The 
 man was taken into custody and returned to the police department; a 
 field test indicated a blood alcohol level of .14%. The victim told 
 Officer Gerke that an argument broke out after the man revealed that he 
 had been fired from his job. At one point he swung and struck her with a 
 closed fist in her chest and called her an&quot;ignorant bitch&quot;. He kept 
 insulting her in the apartment, picked up a chair and swung it at her, 
 and punched her in the right cheek with his fist. He was about to strike 
 her again when he tripped and fell, at which point the woman kicked him 
 in the face and ran out of the apartment. He was arrested for disorderly 
 conduct and battery (as domestic violence), possession of controlled 
 substances, and for a probation violation. 

 At 8:24 PM, 
 Officers Gerke, Henning and Krueger were dispatched to an Oakland Drive 
 home, where a woman reported that her soon-to-be ex-husband had just 
 informed her that he was coming over to commit suicide on the front 
 lawn. The woman said that the man is bipolar and depressed, would not 
 seek treatment or take medication, had just lost his job, and was having 
 a difficult time with the impending divorce. While Officer Henning was 
 speaking with her, the man called from the Main Street Mart. Officer 
 Gerke intercepted the vehicle on Highway 60 east of the freeway and a 
 high risk traffic stop was conducted because it was unknown if the man 
 had obtained a firearm. The man was verbally aggressive and did not obey 
 instructions. At one point he was told he risked being shot if he did 
 not follow the instructions and he replied,&quot;Go ahead, I don&apos;t care&quot;. He 
 was eventually taken into custody. While in Officer Henning&apos;s squad the 
 man made other suicidal statements. He was transported to St. Joseph&apos;s 
 Hospital and interviewed by an ACS worker, who agreed with Officer 
 Henning that the man was a danger to himself and should undergo 
 emergency commitment. Incredibly, a psychiatrist at the facility 
 released the man the next day. 

 On August 23 at 8 
 AM, Kewaskum PD requested mutual assistance from Officer Friedl to 
 inspect a tanker truck with defective equipment and an argumentative 
 driver. Officer Friedl is a federal-level motor carrier inspector. 

 At 8:07 PM, 
 Officers Krueger and Gerke were dispatched to meet Jackson Fire Rescue 
 at a Green Valley residence for a possibly deceased woman. The neighbor 
 reported coming into the trailer at approximately 3 PM with the victim&apos;s 
 mail. She assumed that the resident didn&apos;t respond because she was 
 taking a nap. However when she didn&apos;t see any activity by 8 PM, she 
 reentered and found the 73-year-old woman dead. 

 At 10:33 PM, a 
 clerk from the Village Mart reported that there was a confused elderly 
 woman in the store. Officer Laabs found an 83-year-old Arlington 
 Heights, Illinois woman seated in her Mercedes station wagon. She told 
 Officer Laabs that she was going to see her daughter but had forgotten 
 how to get there. She provided Officer Laabs with her wallet; he located 
 several phone numbers and was eventually able to make contact with her 
 daughter-in-law. That person called another relative who lives in 
 Sturtevant, and Officer Laabs kept the lost woman company until this 
 person arrived at about 12:20 AM. 

 On August 26 
 shortly before 8 PM, Officer Henning stopped a vehicle on Highway 45 for 
 a variety of equipment and registration violations. While speaking to 
 the 41-year-old Cascade man, Officer Henning observed the ends of 
 marijuana cigars inside an open ashtray, a soda can with the base cut 
 off, a square piece of tinfoil used for cooking heroin, and an old 
 prescription pill bottle with pills. Based on these observations, 
 Officer Henning asked the man to step out of the vehicle so he could be 
 patted down for weapons. Officer Fristed arrived to assist. A computer 
 check revealed that the man had a suspended license and was wanted on 
 warrants from St. Francis and Grafton. After the man was arrested and 
 secured in the squad, Officer Henning searched the vehicle further. He 
 observed that a soda can have been used to cook heroin and he also found 
 a metal spoon under the passenger seat that had a burnt base and white 
 powder residue in it. On the driver seat, he found an unfolded piece of 
 tinfoil that was used as a heroine bindle and a folded bindle that still 
 contained heroin. Underneath the driver seat he found an empty cigarette 
 box containing a used needle. When questioned, the man said that he only 
 has tried drugs but is not addicted. When asked about the track marks on 
 his hands and arms, he said they were from work. He blamed the various 
 illegal items on coworkers known only to him as James and Arthur. The 
 man was taken to the County Jail for the warrants and for charges of 
 possession of the heroin and paraphernalia. 

 On August 27 at 
 about 1 AM, Officer Cashin from Slinger PD stopped a possible 
 intoxicated motorcyclist and needed assistance. Since all of the county 
 squads were busy, Officer Laabs provided mutual aid. 

 At 5 PM, Officers 
 Fristed and Foeger assisted a deputy as he took a man into custody 
 pursuant to a&quot;Three Party Petition&quot;for emergency detention. 

 At 5:10 PM, 
 Officer Foeger made this department&apos;s second trip to a local condominium 
 development because an associate of the now-bankrupt developer was 
 removing property on his behalf. Aggrieved residents of the project 
 protested. Although this was a civil matter, the developer was contacted 
 and agreed to have his employee leave until the matter could be sorted 
 out. 

 On August 29 at 
 about 8 PM, Officer Foeger was dispatched to Green Valley after an 
 anonymous caller reported loud yelling coming from a residence. The 
 34-year-old woman was cautioned about yelling profanities so loudly on 
 the phone that the neighbors could hear. 

 At 8:10 PM, 
 Officer Borkowski assisted Officer Cashin in Slinger by searching two 
 female suspects. 

 On August 30 at 
 12:15 AM, Slinger PD requested mutual aid at a traffic stop. No county 
 cars were available, so Officer Krueger provided mutual aid. 

 At 5 PM, an 
 Oakland Drive man told Officer Foeger that when he was running after a 
 poodle that escaped from his pickup truck, a neighbor walking his own 
 dog got upset and said,&quot;the next time I am going to have my gun and I&apos;m 
 going to start shooting&quot;. However, the complainant did not want us to 
 make contact with this individual. 

 At 8:45 PM, 
 Officer Foeger assisted West Bend PD after a convenience store clerk in 
 that city reported that a 12-year-old girl was crying and upset, and 
 didn&apos;t want to leave with her adult male companion. The vehicle was 
 traced to a local family. The man was the girls father, and he 
 explained that shes upset after transferring from a smaller school in 
 another community and is overwhelmed by Badger Middle School. He thanked 
 the clerk for her concern. 

 At 10:27 PM, 
 Officers Borkowski and Krueger were dispatched to a disturbance at a 
 Chestnut Court apartment building. A woman told the officers that the 
 couple across the hall is constantly having problems and the male half 
 comes to her apartment to seek refuge. This has upset his girlfriend and 
 the situation culminated in a verbal confrontation between the two 
 women. She asked that the police tell the woman to leave her alone. When 
 contacted by the officers, the woman was extremely agitated and wouldn&apos;t 
 stop yelling at them. At one point she was encouraged to return to her 
 apartment and Officer Krueger closed the door, however she immediately 
 opened it again, stood in the hallway, and called 911 to complain about 
 the officers. She was told to contact the Chief of Police if she wanted 
 to complain about the officers; she was cited for misuse of 911. Her 
 boyfriend was given a ride to West Bend. See next. 

 At 3:08 AM, on 
 August 31, Officers Borkowski and Krueger returned to the Chestnut Court 
 address regarding a 911 hang-up. The unpleasant woman in the previous 
 incident reported that her boyfriend had returned to the apartment 
 looking for property that she insisted she didn&apos;t have. When the 
 officers contacted her by phone while outside the apartment, the woman 
 refused to speak to them, yelled at Officer Borkowski, and hung up. The 
 man was told that if he returned to the apartment building and bothered 
 the woman again, he would be arrested. No further action could be taken 
 because the complainant refused to talk to the officers. See next. 

 At about 11:15 
 AM, a passerby stopped at the police department and reported that 
 someone was attempting to enter a second floor window at the Chestnut 
 Court apartment building. Officer Friedl, Det. Bloedel, and Chief 
 Dolnick arrived and found head- and side boards from a bed stacked up 
 under a window in front of the building. The apartment belonged to the 
 woman in the previous incidents. As Officer Friedl and Det. Bloedel 
 checked the basement to see if the man was hiding there, the woman&apos;s 
 boyfriend entered the building from a rear door, carrying a ladder, and 
 accompanied by a woman and her two daughters. The woman said that she 
 had been approached by the man as she did laundry in another building. 
 He asked to borrow a ladder because he was locked out of his apartment 
 and was going to enter through the window. Chief Dolnick thanked the 
 woman for her neighborliness and said that her help, and the ladder, 
 wouldn&apos;t be needed. The man said that landscapers had piled up the 
 furniture outside the window and he just wanted to look through the 
 window because he was trying to locate a bag containing&quot;medicine&quot;. 
 Chief Dolnick was joined by the other officers and, after further 
 questioning, the man was arrested for disorderly conduct. The building 
 owner authorized Chief Dolnick to inform the man that he was not to 
 trespass on the property. On September 2, Officers Gerke and Henning 
 were called back to the apartment building after the woman made racial 
 remarks at her neighbor. They found the man with the woman, but she 
 claimed that the apartment manager said it was okay for him to be there. 
 However, this was found to be a lie and she was arrested for obstructing 
 an officer and the man was arrested for trespassing.

 On July 1 shortly 
 before noon, Officer Henning and Chief Dolnick were dispatched to a 
 family trouble at a Jackson Drive home, where a 16-year-old boy had lost 
 his temper and punched a hole in a wall. Further investigation revealed 
 that the 19-year-old brother had been ridiculing him. The boy has some 
 learning disabilities and he vented in an inappropriate manner. Their 
 mother was contacted by telephone at work and said that she would be 
 home soon. The older brother was not cooperative but agreed to leave the 
 house until she arrived. 

 At 8:07 PM, a 911 
 caller reported that a swerving pick-up truck was heading towards the 
 Village on Highway 60. Officer Kyle Henning intercepted the vehicle and 
 just started following it when it rear-ended an SUV that was stopped at 
 a red light at Highway P. The four occupants of the SUV, including a 
 child and infant, were not injured. The 31 year old Slinger man, who had 
 slurred speech and difficulty standing, refused to perform field 
 sobriety tests and was arrested for Operating While under the Influence. 
 The man was convicted of Operating While Intoxicated in 2004 and was 
 arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in Slinger 
 (5/15/11), Jackson (2/9/11), and Germantown (2/3/11). In addition to the 
 driving charge, the man was held at the Washington County Jail for 
 possession of drug paraphernalia and bail-jumping. 

 On July 2 at 8:13 
 PM, Officer Henning attempted to stop a vehicle after determining that 
 the registered owner was revoked. He was able to see that there was a 
 driver and passenger in the front seat. By the time he turned around on 
 Main Street and caught up to the vehicle, he found it parked in a 
 driveway with the passenger door open and that person gone. The driver 
 was a 30-year-old Mayville woman who was eventually cited for operating 
 without a license. The woman identified her passenger as a 35-year-old 
 Mayville man; he was wanted. The man had left a cell phone behind and 
 there were text messages regarding the sale and purchase of drugs. 
 Officer Garro (Slinger PD) advised that he had recent contact with the 
 man and could identify him; he, Trooper Perales, and Officer Foeger 
 assisted in searching for the man. About 10 minutes later, a person 
 reported that a suspicious-acting man had entered the Jackson Pub. 
 Officer Henning checked the interior while other officers covered the 
 exits. He located the man at the bar and took him into custody without 
 incident, and later transported him to County Jail. 

 On July 3 at 
 12:52 AM, Deputy Parkinson stopped a vehicle on Highway 60 just west of 
 the village limits. A short time later, he radioed that a male passenger 
 had just fled on foot. Officers Laabs and Foeger initially assisted in 
 searching for the fleeing man, and then Officer Foeger stood by while 
 the Deputy administered a field sobriety test and then arrested the 
 driver, an 18-year-old man from West Bend. The parents of two juvenile 
 female passengers were called to the scene. Just before 4:00 AM, a 
 Galloway Court resident reported that a young man had just come to his 
 door claiming that he was lost and wanted to use his telephone. The 
 subject was completely wet and had no shoes. The officers searched the 
 area in their squads and on foot, including using a night vision device, 
 but were unable to find the man. 

 At noon, a 
 Stonewall Drive woman told Officer Gerke that a bird feeder had been 
 missing from her second story balcony; she later found it in the grass, 
 empty and broken. She said that the downstairs neighbor had previously 
 asked her to remove the bird feeder because birds were dropping seeds on 
 his patio below. Subsequently, she moved the feeder to a different 
 location. When Officer Gerke attempted to speak to the neighbor, nobody 
 would come to the door and she could hear someone inside telling a 
 barking dog to be quiet. She made telephone contact later with the 
 48-year-old man, who laughed when asked if he had knocked the bird 
 feeder down. 

 On July 5 at 12:26 AM, Officer Laabs 
 stopped a vehicle after observing erratic driving on Main Street; he was 
 assisted by Officer Borkowski. The 23-year-old Mequon man was shirtless 
 and wearing shorts that were too large and falling off of him. Although 
 the man smelled strongly of intoxicants, he denied having anything to 
 drink. A routine inquiry revealed that he was on probation for resisting 
 officers. When he exited his car, Officer Borkowski discovered why the 
 man was shirtless; his white T-shirt was partially covering an open 12 
 pack of Miller High Life. The man failed field sobriety tests and was 
 arrested. The man pleaded to be allowed to drive home because it was the 
 Fourth of July and he was just celebrating like everybody else. A 
 routine search of the vehicle revealed a small amount of cocaine; a 
 marijuana pipe; and synthetic marijuana. While waiting for a tow truck 
 to arrive, Officer Laabs contacted Probation and Parole. When the man 
 realized this, he began loudly chirping like a bird and then screamed. 
 Officer Laabs had to exit the vehicle to continue the phone 
 conversation, at which time the man tried to kick out the rear window of 
 the squad. When Officer Laabs opened the door and told him to stop 
 kicking, the man squirmed and tried to kick him. The man was 
 repositioned in the squad and re-secured. At the hospital, the man tried 
 to lunge at a Deputy as soon as he got out of the squad. The man was 
 completely out of control and, ultimately, three deputies, a State 
 Trooper, and Officer Borkowski had to restrain him while Officer Laabs 
 attempted to read paperwork to the man. The man had to be held down 
 during the blood test and constantly fought and threatened the officers. 
 At the County Jail, the man continued his verbal abuse but chose not to 
 fight the correctional officers who were waiting for him. The blood test 
 for the subject was .17%. He was charged with his second OWI offense, 
 resisting an officer, disorderly conduct (for his behavior at the 
 hospital), and possession of cocaine. The man has been arrested many 
 times for drugs, disorderly conduct, traffic crimes, and resisting 
 arrest. 

 At 12:15 PM, a 24-year-old man told 
 Officer Gerke that he had been hanging out with his ex-girlfriend over 
 the weekend when one of her female friends started making fun of him 
 because he&apos;s from Mequon and doesn&apos;t know anything about street life. 
 He then began receiving text messages and phone calls from this 
 23-year-old Kenosha woman. Finally, he received a voicemail from the 
 woman&apos;s brother as he drove through Jackson:&quot;Keep my sisters and 
 nieces name out of your mouth or I will bring a gun to your face and 
 kill you, mother f***er. When contacted by phone, the Kenosha woman 
 denied making contact with the man but said that he had threatened to 
 call child protective services on her, so she asked her brother for 
 help. The complainant didn&apos;t deny her allegations. As often happens with 
 such situations, the case was closed with a warning to everyone to knock 
 it off. 

 On the morning of July 8, a 
 46-year-old Hemlock Street woman told Officer Friedl that she had 
 received an obscene phone call the night before that she believed had 
 something to do with her ex-husband, with whom she&apos;s been having ongoing 
 problems. The telephone number listed to a Main Street man who the 
 complainant believed was acquainted with her ex. The man denied making 
 the telephone call but could not explain why the Caller ID showed that 
 it originated from his house; he was cited for disorderly conduct. 

 On July 11 at 12:16 AM, Officer Laabs 
 observed a man staggering from light post to light post on Main Street 
 east of Ridgeway Drive. The man had a field breath test of .31% and had 
 just left the Jackson Pub. The 40-year-old man was given a ride to the 
 Cedar Run home he shares with his mother. Officer Laabs followed up the 
 next night with the bartender, who said the man told her when he first 
 came in that he had been drinking with a neighbor all day. She claimed 
 that she served him six bottles of beer but she watered them slightly to 
 keep him from getting over intoxicated. She was surprised when told of 
 his field test, and was warned that a repetition would result in a 
 citation for over-service. 

 At 5:25 PM, Officer Fristed was on 
 routine patrol on Jackson Drive at the same time three teenage boys were 
 walking north. He was flagged down by a resident who reported that one 
 of the boys had just been inside his garage and had taken a soccer ball 
 and skateboard. The 12-year-old Milwaukee boy was visiting his 
 grandmother on Creekside Drive; he was cited for theft. 

 On July 12 at 10:15 AM, Officer Friedl 
 assisted a Probation and Parole agent in arresting a 35-year-old woman 
 at her Hemlock Street apartment for violating parole. The woman is a 
 former teacher who was convicted of having sexual relations with an 
 underage student. See next. 

 At 7:02 PM, Officers Henning and 
 Fristed were called back to the apartment building, where the teachers 
 sister also has an apartment. She said that Social Services had charged 
 her with custody of her sisters young children. The teacher has an 
 older daughter, 17, who lives in West Bend and she was now in the 
 apartment and wouldn&apos;t open the door. Officer Henning saw the garage 
 door go up and made contact with this older daughter and her husband. 
 They agreed to turn over a 15-year-old girl and two-year-old boy to the 
 complainant. See next. 

 On July 13 at 12:42 AM, Officer 
 Borkowski was called to the apartment building because the aunt had 
 enough of her 15-year-old niece and wanted her removed. It turned out 
 that the grandmother (this would be the mother of the teacher and the 
 aunt) also lived in the apartment building, and she took custody of the 
 teenager. See July 14. 

 At 7:45 PM, Officer Fristed was called 
 to the liquor department at Piggly Wiggly where an 82-year-old woman was 
 wandering around and asked the clerk where Kim was so she could get a 
 haircut. It turned out that the woman had wandered away from Ivy Manner, 
 which is located nearby. The following day, Chief Dolnick faxed a copy 
 of the report to the appropriate state agency. 

 On July 14 at 12:30 PM, a resident of 
 the Hemlock Street apartment building told Officer Gerke that the 
 teacher&apos;s sister was now harassing her and her mother because she 
 believed Mom had called Probation and Parole to have the teacher 
 arrested. It seems that Mom and her boyfriend had been having 
 difficulties, so he was spending time with the teacher. The teacher&apos;s 
 family believed she retaliated by calling P&amp;P. The complainant turned 
 over printouts from Facebook which showed conversations between members 
 of the teacher&apos;s family about what they would like to do to the 
 complainant. The complainant asked Officer Gerke not to contact the 
 family. 

 On July 15 at about 1:30 PM, Officer 
 Fristed, Det. Bloedel, and Chief Dolnick responded to an apartment on 
 Ridgeway Drive after a 32-year-old woman was found dead by her mother. 
 The woman explained that she had been contacted by her daughter&apos;s 
 employer after she failed to report for work. She and her husband drove 
 from their Kewaskum home and entered the apartment, and found their 
 daughter in bed, deceased. The medical examiner arrived about an hour 
 later and Officer Foeger was called in to process the scene. Certain 
 circumstances required further investigation by Det. Bloedel and the 
 case remains open. 

 At 9:39 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department 
 asked Officer Foeger to look-out for a suspect vehicle in a disorderly 
 conduct complaint that may have been heading towards the Village on 
 Highway 45. He was unable to locate the vehicle either on the highway or 
 at the owners Town of Jackson residence. 

 At 11:31 PM, Slinger PD requested 
 mutual aid at a domestic violence call, and Officer Fristed responded. 

 On July 16 at 3:10 PM, Officer Fristed 
 was contacted by a 49-year-old Jackson man and his 12-year-old son who 
 lives with his mother in another city. The teenager claimed that his 
 father has kicked, tackled, and spanked him. At first he denied having 
 any idea why his father would&apos;ve done these things, but then admitted 
 that he had been&quot;smarting off&quot;to his father. When interviewed, the 
 father said that he has been having issues with his son during 
 visitation. At one point his son swore at him, at which time he was 
 spanked. He said that he did not kick or tackle his son; the boy had 
 fallen to the ground as the father approached him. Officer Fristed 
 explained to the boy that his father does love him and is trying to 
 teach him the difference between right and wrong, and there was no 
 evidence of child abuse. The boy began to cry and stated that he does 
 not believe that his father loves him because Dad has a four-year-old&quot;new son&quot;and spends all of his time with him. Officer Fristed reminded 
 the boy that the argument occurred before they were supposed to go 
 fishing and then spend time together at the father&apos;s side job. The two 
 were reunited and it was hoped that their communications issues would 
 improve. 

 Shortly after 1 PM on July 18, Acute 
 Care Services advised Chief Dolnick they had received a telephone call 
 from a 51-year-old Jackson man who was making suicidal statements. When 
 Officer Friedl and Officer Gerke were allowed into the residence by the 
 man&apos;s mother, with whom he lives, the man immediately screamed at them,&quot;Get the f*** out of my house. What the f***are you doing here? and 
 continued to scream profanities until they left the room. The man was 
 heard calling his doctors office and a pharmacy to straighten out a 
 problem with his narcotic pain medications. The man was extremely 
 aggressive and hostile, and at one point was heard saying,&quot;I called 
 somebody from the County, but they called the f***ing cops and now I 
 have two f***ing police officers in my G** damned house. Then the man 
 saw that Officer Gerke was speaking to his mother in the living room and 
 made a move towards her, which caused Officer Friedl to warn the man to 
 back off. The man continued to scream threats and obscenities at the 
 officers, including,&quot;get the f*** out of my house before I shoot both 
 you mother-f***ers and your entire G**damned families&quot;. Detective 
 Bloedel and Chief Dolnick, as well as Deputy Nauman arrived to assist, 
 but remained outside to prevent agitating the man even more. Chief 
 Dolnick requested Jackson Fire Rescue to stand-by on the street because 
 it was likely the man would have to be restrained on a gurney if he was 
 going to be taken into emergency detention. When two ACS workers entered 
 the home, the man greeted them the same way. Because they could not 
 communicate with the man, ACS initially decided that he would have to be 
 taken into custody for commitment. However, Officers Friedl and Gerke 
 explained that the man had a back injury, which is why he was so 
 frustrated about not having his pain medication. With his 
 aggressiveness, any attempt to detain him would certainly result in a 
 physical altercation and he could be injured. The ACS workers made a 
 second try and were able to convince the man to follow a voluntary 
 safety plan with the assistance of his family, and he was able to stay 
 home. At one point, the man&apos;s mother said she was going to file a 
 complaint against Officers Friedle and Gerke because she felt they&quot;weren&apos;t nice enough&quot;to her son. 

 On July 20 at about 2 AM, Officer 
 Laabs was on routine patrol and saw a vehicle parked in the driveway of 
 a home on Western Avenue. The driver&apos;s door was open and he could see 
 someone sitting behind the wheel with his left arm and leg stuck out the 
 door. The figure didn&apos;t move when spotlighted, so Officer Laabs exited 
 his squad to investigate. He found an unconscious 22-year-old man with a 
 syringe in one hand and an empty bottle in the other. Concluding that 
 this was likely a drug overdose, Officer Laabs called for Jackson Fire 
 Rescue and was joined by Officer Krueger. The man was immediately 
 transported to the hospital, where he was revived. Further investigation 
 revealed that the man overdosed on heroin. The man recovered quickly and 
 was then transported to County Jail for possession of heroin, marijuana, 
 and paraphernalia. 

 On July 23 at about 5:30 PM, Officer 
 Foeger warned two teenage boys from Cedarburg and West Bend regarding 
 abusive text messages being sent to a third teenager, a resident of the 
 village. The situation reached a climax when a teddy bear was left in 
 the complainant&apos;s driveway with a profane message taped onto it and a 
 banana stuffed up its butt. 

 On July 24 at 6:52 PM, Officer Foeger 
 assisted Deputy Herbst during a consent search after a traffic stop. At 
 about the same time, Officer Gerke was warning a Blackberry Circle man 
 about dumping bags of dog feces into the storm sewer after a nearby 
 resident complained. 

 On July 25 at about 8 PM, Officers 
 Borkowski and Gerke were dispatched to a Center Street house that we are 
 very familiar with, where a 25-year-old man and his mother reported that 
 his girlfriend was running around the neighborhood with cuts to her 
 wrist and stomach. The woman was located at a neighborhood park and told 
 the officers that she cut herself out of frustration with the man and 
 not because she wanted to harm herself. She was treated at the hospital 
 and released. See next. 

 On July 26 at 8:15 AM, Officer Friedl 
 kept the peace at the Center Street home while the now ex-boyfriend 
 attempted to gather his possessions into garbage bags to move out. The 
 now ex-girlfriend did not want him to leave and there was also a dispute 
 about possession of some of the property. Officer Friedl reported that 
 the house was a pigsty and had never seen anything worse. See next. 

 At 3:43 PM, Officers Henning and Gerke 
 returned to the Center Street home where the 25-year-old man had 
 returned to get more of his property. The man displayed receipts for a 
 TV and Xbox and was allowed to remove them; the house was then 
 re-secured. See next. 

 At 5:18 PM Officer Henning returned to 
 the house on Center Street where the 35-year-old ex-girlfriend was 
 hysterical because the ex-boyfriend had supposedly broken in and stolen 
 items. When told that officers had accompanied him, she accused Officer 
 Henning of lying. When told that the man had a receipt showing that his 
 mother had bought the Xbox, the woman said that his mother gave it to 
 her. And Officer Henning lying. See next. 

 At 7:30 PM, Officer Henning spoke to a 
 30-year-old Green Valley man who wanted to report that a PlayStation 
 gaming system and games had been stolen from his trailer. He was first 
 tipped off to this by the woman in the above incidents. After hours of 
 investigation and follow-up by Officer Henning, it was determined that 
 the woman knew about the theft because she had accompanied the 
 ex-boyfriend when he sold them to a store in Germantown. The 
 ex-boyfriend readily admitted what he had done and was issued a 
 municipal citation for receiving stolen property plus $61 of 
 restitution. 

 At 11:35 PM, Officer Laabs made 
 another trip to a cul-de-sac in Green Valley in which the neighbors have 
 been feuding for years. In this episode, an 80-year-old woman complained 
 that her neighbor has a motion sensor light that speaks,&quot;Caution, you 
 are on private property every time she walks on her own driveway, which 
 she feels is harassment. The other woman agreed to angle the motion 
 sensor light a different way. 

 On July 27 at about 4 AM, Officer 
 Laabs and Deputy Miller went to a Hickory Lane residence where an 
 allegedly suicidal man was walking through the house holding a firearm 
 after a family fight. When contacted by phone, the man came outside and 
 was cooperative. He explained that he and his wife had gotten into an 
 argument but no threats, either verbal or physical, were made. When 
 asked about walking through the house with a gun, he said that he was 
 just packing his stuff to leave and didn&apos;t want to leave the weapon 
 there. His story was corroborated by his wife, and it appears that she 
 jumped to some conclusions when she called 911. No further action was 
 necessary. 

 On July 28 at 5:09 AM, Officer Laabs 
 was dispatched to a Georgetown Drive address, where a 34-year-old woman 
 was reportedly having an argument with nonexistent people in her 
 kitchen. Her husband reported that his wife had not slept in several 
 days and she might be abusing prescription medication. The woman was now 
 unresponsive on the couch and Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched for a 
 possible overdose of Lorazepam. See next. 

 At 1 PM, Officers Friedl and Gerke 
 returned to Georgetown Drive, where the woman in the above incident had 
 returned home after being released from the hospital. It appeared that 
 she had again taken too much medication, as her speech was slurred and 
 she was stumbling. Officer Gerke transported her to the hospital for 
 treatment and contacted ACS. Social Services was also notified because 
 two of the four minor children were unkempt and dirty, and the residence 
 was filthy and smelled of rotten food. 

 On July 29 at 5:50 PM, Officer Henning 
 was told by a 30-year-old Chestnut Court woman that her former 
 boyfriend/roommate was keeping some of her property and wouldn&apos;t return 
 it unless she performed sexual favors. She displayed text messages that 
 referred to a jewelry box and contents, and described the sex acts that 
 he wanted her to perform. The man agreed to return the property rather 
 than face arrest for extortion. 

 

 June 

 Police officers responded to the 
 following fire and rescue calls: 

       June 2 at 8:47 PM, 
 Officer Krueger: 56-year-old man, possible heart attack. 

       June 7 at 8:31 PM, 
 Officer Foeger: 41-year-old man, four-year-old son jumped on him. 

       June 8 at 8:15 AM, 
 Officer Fristed: 54-year-old woman, feeling lightheaded. 

       June 8 at 8:43 PM, 
 Officer Borkowski: 70-year-old man, fell on wet grass and hurt head. 

       June 9 at 7:29 AM, 
 Officer Fristed: 62-year-old man, fell and hurt head. 

       June 16 at 9:13 PM, 
 Officer Foeger: 62-year-old woman, cardiac issue. 

       June 16 at 6:25 PM, 
 Officer Foeger: 78-year-old man, dazed and confused. 

       June 18 at 4:11 AM, 
 Officer Krueger: false fire alarm. 

       June 19 at 5:30 PM, 
 Officer Krueger: 78-year-old woman, blacked out after surgery. 

       June 26 at 2:07 AM, 
 Officer Borkowski: 86-year-old woman, respiratory problem. 

       June 27 at 3:19 PM, 
 Officer Foeger: 39-year-old man, fell. 

       June 28 at 2:49 PM, 
 Officer Gerke: nine-year-old boy, fell and was unresponsive 

   

 On June 1 at 1:30 AM, a supervisor at 
 Kerry Ingredients told Officer Krueger that two naked people were inside 
 a minivan in the parking lot. The van was empty and Officer Krueger 
 waited to see if anyone came back. After about 20 minutes, a man and 
 woman returned (dressed). The gentleman told a bizarre story about 
 allowing a coworker at another business to use the van to get 
 cigarettes, but the man never returned. Since the supervisor just wanted 
 the vehicle gone, no further action was taken. 

   

 On June 2 at 7:08 PM, Officers Gerke 
 and Henning were dispatched to a Hickory Lane apartment where a 
 23-year-old woman reported that she had been struck in the face by her 
 23-year-old boyfriend who then fled on foot. Officer Gerke met with the 
 woman while Officer Henning and two deputies looked for the suspect. The 
 incident began with an argument over finances and their power being cut 
 off, which he felt was the woman&apos;s fault. She told the man that her 
 paycheck goes into a joint checking account while he spends his money at 
 Potawatomi and similar venues. At this, he stood up and slapped her on 
 the forehead, held her down on the couch, and punched her in the left 
 cheek while holding a cigarette lighter. The three-year-old daughter 
 told Officer Gerke,&quot;Daddy hit Mommy and Mommy called the cops on Dad&quot;. 
 The victim&apos;s parents arrived and said they had spotted the suspect 
 walking nearby. Officer Henning located and arrested him without 
 incident. He denied having any physical contact with the victim and said 
 that she has violent mood swings because she&apos;s off her birth control 
 pills. The man was already on bail for a previous domestic violence case 
 with the same woman, and was arrested for bail jumping as well as this 
 incident. 

   

 At 9:21 PM, a 30-year-old Georgetown 
 Drive man told Officer Krueger that a teenage neighbor threatened to 
 have a person come and beat him up. The bad feelings are due to a past 
 incident in which the man was accused, but not prosecuted for, sexually 
 assaulting the girl. The girl was warned for harassment and her mother 
 notified. 

   

 On June 4 at 4:16 PM, Officer Henning 
 stopped a vehicle on Highway 45 after computer inquiry showed the 
 vehicle was not registered and the owner was suspended. The driver was a 
 34-year-old Fond du Lac man and the passenger was his 29-year-old 
 brother from Milwaukee. Both men were extremely nervous. The brother was 
 shaking and his hands had bumps and scars consistent with&quot;track marks&quot;from drug use. Because the driver had a criminal history for drug 
 possession, Germantown&apos;s K9 was requested. Ultimately, assorted 
 paraphernalia for the use of marijuana and heroin were recovered. 

   

 At about 7:38 PM, a man told Officer 
 Henning that he was concerned about a 45-year-old Stonewall Drive woman, 
 a fellow AA member, who sounded suicidal during a phone call. The woman 
 is well known to us from prior alcohol-related issues. Because the woman 
 becomes uncooperative when intoxicated, Officer Henning was joined by 
 Deputies Herriges and Vanier. The woman didn&apos;t respond to the doorbell 
 for about 10 minutes. Because of the possibility of suicide, the 
 officers decided to check on the woman&apos;s welfare by entering through an 
 open garage door. She was passed out on the couch. After being awakened, 
 Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched to transport her to the hospital. A 
 field screening showed a blood-alcohol level of .31%, to which the woman 
 responded,&quot;Thats nothing&quot;. It wasn&apos;t until 2 AM that Officer Henning 
 and Officer Krueger were able to leave the hospital and transported the 
 woman to a psychiatric unit. 

   

 On June 6 at 4:41 PM, Officer Henning 
 recognized the driver of a passing vehicle as a 20-year-old Jackson 
 woman who was currently wanted on warrants for probation violation. A 
 routine search of the woman&apos;s purse revealed assorted prescription 
 medications, a syringe, a razor blade, alcohol prep pads, and a 
 Band-Aid. Charges were requested for illegal possession of the 
 prescription medication. Although it can be assumed that the other items 
 were for drug use, they are not considered drug paraphernalia under the 
 law. 

   

 At 7:03 PM, Officer Henning and 
 Officer Foeger were dispatched to a Ridgeway Drive residence regarding a 
 family fight. The 51-year-old husband reported that he&apos;d gotten into an 
 argument with his wife and was struck several times. The woman admitted 
 throwing a cup of coffee at, and striking, her husband. The woman was 
 arrested for domestic violence. The woman later filed a complaint 
 against Officer Henning for being&quot;too aggressive&quot;for arresting her. 

   

 On June 7 at 8:30 PM, a 41-year-old 
 Hemlock Street man who, with his wife, has been the source of many 
 police calls since they moved here a few months ago, said that he needed 
 the rescue squad because his four-year-old son fell on him. Officer 
 Foeger stood by and assisted Jackson Fire Rescue. See June 18. 

   

 On June 8 at 12:32 AM, Officers 
 Borkowski, Foeger and Laabs were dispatched to Jackson Park, where some&quot;carnies&quot;, who were in town for Action in Jackson, were fighting. It 
 turned out that this was simply an argument concerning ownership of some 
 speakers and everyone dispersed peacefully. 

   

 At 6:40 PM, a 17-year-old Chestnut Court resident told 
 Officer Foeger that a 17-year-old Green Valley girl had tried to choke 
 him while holding a large rock. The young man said that the dispute was 
 over a drug deal that went bad. The girl had no hesitation confirming 
 this, saying that she gave the complainant $105 to purchase marijuana, 
 which she then intended to sell. Later, the complainant told her that 
 he&apos;d been held up at gunpoint at a Jackson apartment, and was relieved 
 of the money before the deal was consummated with the unknown dealer. 
 Not surprisingly, the girl believed this was a ruse, and the man had 
 just kept the money for himself. She confronted him while holding a 
 large rock and grabbed him by the throat. He indignantly replied,&quot;What? 
 You want to get shot? She believed, therefore, that the complainant was 
 in the wrong. No further action was taken. 

 [Action in 
 Jackson ran from the night of June 10 to the afternoon of June 12.] 

 On June 10 at 
 about 4:30 PM, Officer Fristed was dispatched to a family trouble 
 involving a 15-year-old girl at a Chestnut Court apartment. Upon 
 arrival, the father told him that his daughter had been out of control, 
 kicking, pushing and hitting him. The girl was sitting in a reclining 
 chair holding a shirt and sewing needle. He directed her to put the 
 shirt and needle down, but she refused and started hollering at him. He 
 grabbed her wrist holding the shirt and needle, at which time she tried 
 to pull away and clenched her right hand. She began screaming and 
 swearing, during which Officer Fristed kept ordering her to let go of 
 the needle. She kneed the officer in the right hip area and then tried 
 to push them off with her leg. The father held her leg to try to keep 
 her from kicking. Officer Fristed used one hand to immobilize the wrist 
 holding the needle and used his other hand to push the emergency button 
 on his portable radio. This should have initiated a hands-free 
 transmission so he could call for another officer. However, for reasons 
 that have still not been explained, his radio could not connect to the 
 system from this first floor apartment, so he had to ask the father to 
 call 911. During the struggle, both the girl and Officer Fristed were 
 stuck by the needle. Officer Foeger arrived within minutes to help 
 Officer Fristed restrain and handcuff the girl. As a precaution, Jackson 
 Fire Rescue was dispatched to the scene but the girl refused transport 
 and was placed in Officer Foeger&apos;s squad. Because of the needle stick, 
 the girl and Officer Fristed were examined at the hospital, and the girl 
 was also checked for infectious diseases. During the subsequent 
 investigation, it was found that the altercation had begun about an hour 
 earlier when the girl allegedly attacked her sister. The girl was held 
 in secure detention and a juvenile referral was made for battery to a 
 law enforcement officer. 

 At 9:45 PM, 
 Officer Henning and Officer Krueger were on foot patrol in Jackson Park 
 and heard voices coming from the railroad tracks west of the skate park. 
 They found four boys, ages 13-15 and all from the West Bend area, 
 walking along the railroad tracks. Officer Krueger could smell marijuana 
 coming from them and their eyes were bloodshot. One of the boys was 
 carrying cigarettes and another had cigarettes and a baggie of 
 marijuana. These two were taken into custody, cited, and their parents 
 notified. 

 On June 11 at 
 about 11 PM, Officer Laabs was parked on Jackson Drive near Ridge Road 
 when he noticed that a vehicle overtaking from behind had veered into 
 the curb lane and would strike his Expedition if it continued on that 
 trajectory. It returned to the correct lane as it passed, although it 
 was speeding at 37 mph. Due to the Action in Jackson festivities, there 
 was heavy pedestrian traffic in the area, so Officer Laabs pulled out to 
 stop the vehicle. He overtook it at the intersection with Main Street 
 and noticed that the vehicle went straight ahead although it was in the 
 left turn lane. The vehicle did not pull over for his red lights until 
 it had traveled several blocks. The driver was a 29-year-old from 
 Grafton who had slurred speech and smelled of intoxicants. The man 
 failed field sobriety tests and was arrested; the blood test was .19%. 

 On June 12 at 
 1:35 AM, Chief Dolnick was waiting to make a left turn to Main Street 
 when an intoxicated pedestrian stopped in the middle of the crosswalk 
 and just stood there, gathering his thoughts. The man continued to walk 
 after the Chief tooted the horn, but another drunk took offense and, not 
 realizing it was an unmarked police car, yelled,&quot;F*** you. When 
 questioned, the Hemlock Street man said that he had recently moved to 
 Jackson from Milwaukee. He was told to behave himself or consider 
 returning there. 

 At 1:49 AM, 
 Officer Henning, Det. Bloedel, and Chief Dolnick were dispatched to a 
 family fight at a Wilshire Drive residence. The 51-year-old man reported 
 that his wife had returned home from Action in Jackson and broke a 
 window when he didn&apos;t answer the door. Although he didn&apos;t want to press 
 charges, it was felt that she should spend the night somewhere else to 
 avoid further conflict. Officer Henning gave her a ride to a friend&apos;s 
 home 

  At about 2 AM, 
 Officer Laabs and Officer Foeger were dispatched to a White Oak Circle 
 home, where the residents reported that a young woman had tried to enter 
 their house through the front door. The 21-year-old Heather Drive woman 
 was intoxicated and thought she was at her own home. The homeowners 
 allowed her into the house, and she sat on the couch and fell asleep. 
 The officers spent about an hour trying to find a place for her to stay 
 to avoid having to place her in detox. Eventually, the woman was able to 
 identify a friend on Ash Drive who agreed to take her in. 

 At about 2:30 AM, 
 Officer Henning observed a vehicle revving its engine loudly as it went 
 past groups of people on Main Street. The taverns had just closed for 
 the night and, due to Action in Jackson, they had been especially busy 
 and a lot of people were walking. Officer Henning continued to follow 
 the vehicle as it sped up to 40 mph and began driving erratically. The 
 26-year-old Allenton man said that he was coming from Action in Jackson. 
 His eyes were bloodshot and glassy and his speech was slow and slurred. 
 He admitted to having the usual&quot;two drinks&quot;. He also had the smell of 
 burnt marijuana on his clothing but he denied having smoked any. The man 
 failed the field sobriety tests and was arrested; the blood test was 
 .13%. 

 At 4:18 PM, 
 Officer Henning was parked on a crossover on Highway 45 near Highway 
 145, waiting for traffic to clear so he could return to the village. A 
 routine check of a passing Cadillac revealed that the registered owner 
 was revoked for prior OWI arrests. In speaking to the 30-year-old 
 Milwaukee man, Officer Henning noticed the strong odor of marijuana 
 emanating from the vehicle. When asked about the odor of marijuana, the 
 man admitting that hed been smoking same and turned over a marijuana 
 cigar. The man&apos;s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and his speech was 
 raspy. He was also extremely nervous and his hands were shaking. The man 
 claimed that he used marijuana to self medicate for Crohn&apos;s disease. The 
 man failed his field sobriety tests and was taken into custody. A search 
 of the vehicle revealed two packages of White Owl cigars, one of which 
 contained a cigar that was half tobacco and half marijuana. There were 
 also three empty bags containing marijuana flakes; a metal marijuana 
 grinder containing marijuana; two jars containing numerous bags of 
 marijuana; an airtight container containing more bags of marijuana; and 
 a digital scale which had marijuana flakes on its surfaces. In addition 
 to the charge of operating while under the influence of a restricted 
 controlled substance, charges were also requested for possession of 
 marijuana with intent to deliver, possession of drug paraphernalia, and 
 operating after revocation. In all, about pound of marijuana was 
 seized. The Police Department asked the District Attorney to petition 
 the court for an asset forfeiture, allowing the Department to seize the 
 mans 1999 Cadillac which could then be sold. 

 On June 13 at 
 4:30 PM, Officer Henning assisted the Sheriff&apos;s Department with a 
 motorcycle vs. car crash on Highway 60 at Scenic Road. 

 On June 14 at 11 
 AM, Officer Friedl was dispatched to a Oakland Drive residence, where a 
 68-year-old man was found dead by his son. The man had returned only the 
 day before after open heart surgery and seemed to be doing well. Det. 
 Bloedel assisted. 

 At 8:50 PM, 
 Officer Henning assisted Slinger PD in the apprehension of a resident 
 who was wanted by Illinois on an extraditable warrant and who was 
 thought to be armed and dangerous. Officer Henning, Slingers Officer 
 Garro and two deputies went to the residence, entered, and apprehended 
 the man without incident. While inside the house, the officers observed 
 needles, burned metal bottle caps, and small bags containing heroin. 

 At 5 PM, a 
 42-year-old Hemlock Street man complained to Officer Foeger about dogs 
 running at large. After completing the investigation, Officer Foeger 
 arrested the man for an outstanding warrant from Germantown. 

 On June 17 at 
 about 3 PM, a 17-year-old Main Street woman reported that she had locked 
 herself in the house because she believed a man was stalking her. The 
 complainant reported receiving text messages repeatedly for an hour and 
 a half, all of which she ignored. He then texted that he was going to be 
 outside her house, and she replied that he was not welcome and she would 
 call the police if he did. Officer Foeger and Det. Bloedel spotted a 
 19-year-old Jackson man standing near the home. The man initially denied 
 knowing the girl, sending her a text message that he would be standing 
 outside, knowing she was in the house he was standing near, and wanting 
 to have contact with her. The man was warned for disorderly conduct and 
 told not to have any contact with the girl or he would be arrested. 
 However, about two hours later Officer Borkowski returned to the house 
 after the man posted abusive messages about her on Facebook. When 
 contacted, the man again denied having contact with her. He was cited 
 for disorderly conduct. 

 At about 4 PM, 
 Officer Foeger and Officer Borkowski were called to the Eastside Mart, 
 where a 29-year-old Town of Trenton man had been hanging around for over 
 two hours. The man claimed that he was homeless and had nowhere to go. 
 The man was uncooperative and became defensive when asked how he got to 
 the store in the first place. He asked for a ride to Slinger and a 
 cigarette, both of which were refused. He was told not to return to the 
 store. About 15 minutes later, the officers were called to the Piggly 
 Wiggly across the street because the man was now lying down on the 
 shoulder of Eagle Drive. Prior to their arrival, someone else called to 
 report that the man was now laying down on Ridgeway Drive; the man was 
 found lying down in someone&apos;s backyard. He claimed to have diabetes and 
 had not eaten in some time. Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched to the 
 scene, and one of the EMTs said he was familiar with the man. He smelled 
 of intoxicants and was somewhat confused, but was coherent and able to 
 talk. The man usually consumes vodka, gets intoxicated, and the demands 
 rides from officers from one place to the next. The man became abusive 
 and loud at the hospital, and threatened to shoot Officer Foeger in the 
 future. Acute Care Services was contacted, and the worker said that he 
 was very familiar with the man and would convey him to Calm Harbor. 

 On June 18 at 
 2:13 PM, a 30-year-old Green Valley man complained to Officer Gerke that 
 a neighbor was spreading stories about him being involved in drugs. The 
 man named several people that he associates with who are, in fact, known 
 drug users. The neighbor said that he became suspicious after seeing 
 people going in and out of the complainant&apos;s trailer frequently and in 
 short time spans, and appeared to be exchanging money with him. 

 At 4:13 PM, the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department received a 911 call of a possible intoxicated 
 driver heading towards the village from Slinger. Deputies and Slinger PD 
 were unable to intercept the vehicle, and Officer Gerke advised that she 
 would be heading westbound in an attempt to find it. She intercepted the 
 vehicle near Highway 45. The 24-year-old Franklin man said that he was 
 heading to Milwaukee after playing golf in Hartford. He said his erratic 
 driving might have been caused by his unfamiliarity with the area, 
 although he admitted to having some beers at the golf course. The 
 complainant said that the man&apos;s car was tailgating and weaving. The 
 field sobriety test did not provide probable cause for arrest; however 
 the field breath test was .08%. The man agreed to allow his vehicle to 
 be towed away and he was given a ride to a location to be picked up by a 
 friend. 

 At 8 PM, Officer 
 Gerke and Officer Borkowski returned to the Hemlock Street apartment 
 where the 41-year-old man said that his wife had struck him in the back. 
 The argument began when he confronted his wife about information that 
 she had had sex with another man when they lived in Brown Deer. She got 
 upset and slapped him on the back, and he wanted her arrested for&quot;assault&quot;. The woman agreed to spend the night somewhere else. See June 
 25. 

 On June 19 at 
 9:17 PM, Officer Borkowski assisted a West Bend officer as he arrested a 
 man for a domestic violence case that occurred in that city. 

 On June 20 at 9 
 AM, a 67-year-old woman requested assistance because she was the 
 unwelcomed recipient of attention from a childhood friend who had 
 tracked her down. Chief Dolnick asked an upstate Sheriff&apos;s Department to 
 tell him that any further contact would result in his arrest for 
 harassment. 

 On June 22, the 
 Police Department was notified that spray painted obscenities had been 
 painted on equipment at the skate park and playground equipment in 
 Jackson Park. About a week later, Officer Henning was contacted by 
 someone who had first-hand information about who was responsible. After 
 further investigation, Officer Henning referred a 15-year-old Jackson 
 girl and a 16-year-old Menomonee Falls girl to juvenile court for 
 criminal damage to property. 

 On June 23 at 
 8:24 AM, a 52-year-old Jackson woman drove her car over the curb on 
 Riverview Drive and hit several mailboxes. She told Officer Friedl that 
 she had worked overnight and may have fallen asleep at the wheel. At 
 3:15 PM, Brian Kober, the Director of Public Works, saw a street tree on 
 Jackson Drive at Hickory Drive had been snapped off. Chief Dolnick 
 determined that the vehicle had driven over the curb, snapped off the 
 tree, drove along the terrace for about 40 feet before reentering 
 Jackson Drive. Tread marks on the road showed that the vehicle skidded 
 towards the curb a second time before driving away. Chief Dolnick 
 recovered a side view mirror that broke off the suspect vehicle. The 
 next morning, Officer Friedl spotted a vehicle at Jackson Auto Body that 
 was missing its passenger side mirror and was the same color as the one 
 recovered at the scene. It happened to be the same vehicle that struck 
 the mailboxes the previous morning. The woman denied being involved in 
 the second accident. The tree had not been damaged earlier in the day, 
 so this was a separate incident from the first one. The woman was issued 
 citations for hit and run/property adjacent to highway and failure to 
 report accident. She will also be responsible for the cost of replacing 
 the tree, and DMV was asked to check on her fitness for driving. 

 On June 25 at 
 10:39 AM, Officer Friedl was dispatched to a fight between a mother and 
 son and a Creekside Drive residence. As he arrived, neighbors told him 
 that the two people had gone back into the house. Then another neighbor 
 ran over and shouted that the 20-year-old son had just run out the back 
 door. Then the mother came out and told Officer Friedl that the fight 
 began when she discovered that her son&apos;s girlfriend had spent the night. 
 When she tried to talk to them, they responded by saying they wanted to 
 sleep in. The son came upstairs and a verbal argument ensued. This 
 continued outside and the mother asked the neighbors to call the police. 
 Deputy Hennes located the man and returned him to the scene. The man was 
 arrested for disorderly conduct and held for bail jumping. His 
 girlfriend was cited for disorderly conduct and released. 

 At about 4 PM, 
 Officer Henning received a report of a man in the area of Hemlock and 
 Hickory, soliciting for a ride to the Jackson Motel. It was the same 
 41-year-old man from Hemlock Street; he was told to leave people alone 
 and walk to the motel. 

 About 15 minutes 
 later, Officer Henning was dispatched to a Georgetown Drive apartment 
 regarding a woman who was not supposed to be there. The 22-year-old 
 complainant told Officer Henning that her stepmother has previously been 
 warned for harassment and was not supposed to have any further contact 
 with them. The woman allegedly sent harassing e-mails and letters to her 
 children and stole painkillers from her. The woman had already left when 
 Officer Henning arrived. When called on the phone, she claimed she was 
 there to drop off strawberries with her brother who lived in a nearby 
 apartment. When he wasn&apos;t home, she and her husband decided to go to the 
 complainant&apos;s apartment. The rest of the conversation did not go well, 
 and Officer Henning told the complainant that she should consider 
 getting a restraining order. 

 At 6:24 PM, 
 Officer Henning was dispatched to a report of a woman laying on the 
 ground near the roundabout on Stonewall Drive and Living Word Lane. The 
 41-year-old Chestnut Court woman said that she was just sitting around 
 and hadn&apos;t been drinking. When Officer Henning pointed out the numerous 
 open and partially consumed cans of beer around her, she said that she 
 might have had a few beers. In fact, the woman was highly intoxicated 
 and a field breath test registered .31%. She was taken to a hospital for 
 medical clearance and later transported by Officer Henning to an 
 inpatient facility. 

 At about 7:13 PM, 
 Officer Borkowski was dispatched to a Spruce Street apartment, where a 
 15-year-old girl had slapped a four-year-old child on the hand to get a 
 bottle cap. The father said that the neighbor girl had previously been 
 swearing in their presence, so this was an escalation of her 
 misbehavior. Officer Borkowski counseled the girl not to have contact 
 with the children, to keep her hands to herself, and not to get involved 
 in their activities. See June 26. 

 On June 26 at 
 9:25 AM, Officer Gerke monitored Deputy Nauman as he investigated a 
 hit-and-run accident to a mailbox on Magna Vista Drive, north of the 
 village. About 45 minutes later, she spotted a vehicle that matched the 
 description of the one involved in the accident. The 18-year-old 
 Hustisford man denied being in an accident. When asked why his hands 
 were shaking, he said that he hit a curb stop at Walgreens and he was 
 concerned his mother would be angry. Deputy Nauman arrived and, after 
 further questioning, the man admitted to the hit-and-run. 

 At 3:13 PM, 
 Officer Foeger was dispatched to a Hemlock Street apartment, where 
 neighbors could hear a physical fight and yelling. Upon arrival, several 
 people advised that they could hear what appeared to be a fight coming 
 from a specific apartment. He was then approached by a 12-year-old boy 
 who said that he and his nine-year-old brother had been physically 
 abused by his mother&apos;s boyfriend, a 40-year-old Germantown man. When 
 contacted by Officer Foeger, the boyfriend initially denied being 
 involved in a fight. Upon further questioning, he admitted punching the 
 nine-year-old several times. The youngster was visiting Grandma at Green 
 Valley and doing some yard work for the neighbors, and got angry at his 
 brother for tattling that he was drinking a Mountain Dew. He 
 retaliated by throwing a slushy at him, which got on the carpet. Mom 
 says that she slapped the boy&apos;s shoulder with her right hand, the boy 
 acted up, she stepped away because she felt she might&quot;lose it&quot;, and 
 told Boyfriend to&quot;talk to him&quot;. She claimed that she didn&apos;t see her 
 boyfriend hit the boy. The boyfriend said that he&quot;lost it&quot;and slapped 
 the boy two or three times. The boy verified that his mother slapped him 
 several times but said that the boyfriend punched him, hard, in the arm 
 several times. When Officer Foeger saw the bruises left on the boy&apos;s 
 back and arm, he requested Jackson Fire Rescue and arrested the man. It 
 should be noted that the man is on probation for robbery. The boy was 
 conveyed to the hospital for examination. Acute Care Services arrived at 
 the hospital and performed a&quot;temporary physical custody&quot;whereby the 
 boy would be returned to the custody of the mother on the condition that 
 the boyfriend not has contact with him. 

 At about 8 PM, 
 Officer Borkowski and Officer Foeger were dispatched to a Hemlock Street 
 apartment building regarding a disorderly conduct/neighbor problem. 
 Several residents complained about a 27-year-old neighbor who allegedly 
 almost struck a small child while backing out of the driveway; drives 
 like a&quot;bat out of Hell&quot;through the parking lot; allows his cats to 
 climb out the second story window to play on the roof; uses profanity 
 around children; and used an ice pick on a downspout because he was 
 bored. The man, who is on probation, said that when he moved-in the 
 neighbors threatened that they would get him to move if they didn&apos;t like 
 him. 

 At about 11 PM, 
 Officer Borkowski and Officer Krueger went to a Hemlock Street apartment 
 building regarding a disorderly person. The woman said that a 
 15-year-old girl walked up to her fianc and said,&quot;I should have f***ing 
 kicked your ass earlier&quot;. When she asked what was going on, the girl 
 called her profanities that cannot be reported here. Ironically, this 
 was the girl who was warned for striking the youngster several days 
 earlier, and the fianc was the man in the above incident. The girl was 
 told, in the presence of her mother that she would be taken into 
 physical custody if she continued to act up. 

 On June 28 at 
 1:40 PM, Officer Gerke was dispatched to the dental office, where a 
 66-year-old woman was dissatisfied with her dentists work and was 
 refusing to leave until she could contact her attorney. The woman left 
 prior to the officers arrival and the dentist sent her letter severing 
 their business relationship. 

 On June 29 at 
 9:22 PM, a bartender at Links Hideaway reported that a man had been 
 sitting at the end of the bar throughout the night, apparently 
 masturbating through his clothing. Then, when she went around the bar to 
 take out a garbage bag, she observed that he was doing this while 
 exposing himself. Officer Henning and Deputy Meier went into the bar and 
 arrested a 40-year-old Chestnut Court man for lewd and lascivious 
 behavior. Further investigation revealed that the man has been arrested 
 for this several times over the years in other jurisdictions. 

 On June 30 at 
 2:16 PM, Officer Henning and Chief Dolnick responded to a Main Street 
 home where a 17-year-old girl complained that she had been attacked by 
 her mother. However, further investigation revealed that the fight began 
 when Mom refused to allow the girl to go to Summerfest. The girl got 
 angry and grabbed her mother on the arm, scratching her. She then 
 grabbed an urn containing her maternal grandfathers ashes and threw it 
 against the wall, then kicked and broke the door. The girl was already 
 under juvenile supervision for prior cases, but as a 17-year-old she 
 could be charged as an adult and, accordingly, Officer Henning opted to 
 take her to jail for disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property.

 On May 1 at about 1:15 AM, Officer 
 Fristed was conducting a routine bar check when he observed a 
 48-year-old resident who he knew was out on bail for a sexual assault 
 charge. After leaving the bar, he determined that the man was still 
 subject to a&quot;no drink&quot;restriction. At about 2:23 AM, Officer Fristed 
 stopped and questioned the man as he walked home. The man submitted to a 
 field test, with a result of .11%. The man was taken into custody for 
 bail jumping. 

 On May 2 at 5:41 PM, Officer Fristed 
 returned to a residence which was the scene of numerous calls in April. 
 The 33-year-old woman told him that her ex-boyfriend, a 35-year-old 
 Hemlock Street man, had come to pick up their two children and drove 
 away. She claimed that he swerved towards her 11-year-old nephew as he 
 was walking on the curb. The boy said that the man didn&apos;t swerve towards 
 him but he did turn around and make an obscene gesture after he passed. 
 The man said that he turned around and pointed at his children to close 
 the window, and did not make a gesture at the boy. 

 At about the same time, a 31-year-old 
 Milwaukee woman told Officer Foeger that the father of her child had 
 custody rights for their 10-year-old son every other weekend, but she 
 had not seen the child since April 19. When interviewed, the father 
 explained that her ex-girlfriend is a lesbian and currently living with 
 her girlfriend, which he does not feel is a proper environment for his 
 son. The man was cooperative, however, and returned the child to Mom. 

 At 9:36 PM, Officer Borkowski met with 
 a 34-year-old Grafton woman in the Police Department parking lot. She 
 reported that her 15-year-old son did not want to return to her 
 ex-husband&apos;s Hemlock Street apartment because they got into a heated 
 argument the day before. Officer Borkowski called the man and asked if 
 he would allow the son to stay with Mom an extra evening until things 
 calm down, which he agreed to. See May 4. 

 On May 4 at 7:31 AM, Officer Fristed 
 was called to a Ridgeway Court residence because a 12-year-old boy was 
 having a temper tantrum and refused to go to school. 

 At 5:10 PM, Slinger PD requested 
 mutual aid at a domestic fight because it had only one officer working 
 and no deputies were available to assist. Officer Gerke assisted Officer 
 Cook. A man had gotten intoxicated after drinking most of a pint of 
 brandy and began calling his girlfriend a variety of profanities that 
 cannot be reported here. As there was no physical contact or threats 
 involved, the man was removed from the scene and turned over to the care 
 of a sober friend. 

 At 8:16 PM, the 15-year-old boy asked 
 Officer Foeger if he would stand-by as the boy spoke to his father about 
 the problems they were having lately. The father was frustrated that the 
 boy is not listening to him and getting poor grades in school. After the 
 discussion, it was agreed that the boy could stay at the residence and 
 try to work their differences out. 

 On May 6 at 12 PM, Officer Gerke was 
 contacted by a County caseworker regarding possible child abuse to a 
 seven-year-old boy. Jackson Elementary School reported that the boy had 
 come to school with a black eye. However, further investigation revealed 
 that the boy had been injured while wrestling with his 15-year-old 
 uncle. 

 At 5:22 PM, Officer Henning assisted 
 Slinger PD with traffic control at a fire scene. 

 At 7:07 PM, a Georgetown Drive man 
 told Officer Henning that his 11-year-old daughter had been playing in 
 the neighborhood park when she was approached by a 12-year-old boy 
 carrying a knife. The boy&apos;s mother claimed she had been watching the 
 whole thing from her kitchen and it was the girl who walked up to her 
 son. In any event, the knife was confiscated and destroyed, and the boy 
 was warned for disorderly conduct. 

 At 8:42 PM, Officers Henning and 
 Krueger returned to a Hemlock Street apartment which was the scene of 
 many complaints between an estranged husband and wife. Two officers 
 were dispatched because the woman reported concerns for her son&apos;s 
 safety. The woman claimed that her husband was storing illicit drugs in 
 the garage. A search revealed no drugs, so the woman concluded that 
 someone must&apos;ve tipped her husband off and he moved them inside the 
 house. Before leaving, the officers checked on the four-year-old to make 
 sure that he was okay. See May 20. 

 On May 7 at 2:49 AM, Officers Krueger 
 and Laabs were dispatched to a Green Valley residence where a 
 61-year-old man had called a veterans crisis line, saying that he had 
 weapons inside the house and felt suicidal. The man was calm and 
 cooperative, and immediately pointed to a variety of unloaded guns that 
 were lying around. The man was intoxicated and said that he did feel 
 suicidal but did not intend to harm anyone else. After evaluation by a 
 caseworker from Acute Care Services, the man agreed to a voluntary 
 commitment at the VA Hospital in Milwaukee. 

 At 7:32 PM, a 39-year-old Spruce 
 Street man told Officer Henning that he found a suicide note from his 
 48-year-old girlfriend, indicating that she was going to drown herself 
 in Pike Lake. Deputy Stevens located the woman at the state park. She 
 was intoxicated and claimed that she wrote the note just to get back at 
 her boyfriend. After being interviewed by a County caseworker, the woman 
 agreed to a voluntary, non-secure stay at a facility in West Bend. 

 At 9:48 PM, Officers Krueger and 
 Henning were dispatched to Chestnut Court, where two men were arguing in 
 front of an apartment building. The argument was over whether one man 
 had received a phone call from the other about&quot;hanging out&quot;. The 
 complainant and two suspects are all well known to us. The men were 
 warned that any further problems that night would result in their 
 arrest. 

 On May 8 at about 11:14 PM, Officers 
 Krueger and Laabs were dispatched to a Hemlock Street apartment where a 
 21-year-old intoxicated woman was allegedly found in a vehicle and tried 
 to drive off with one of her children. The officers were met outside by 
 the 22-year-old boyfriend and they could hear the woman through an open 
 window yelling into a phone. He said that the woman hit him in the face 
 with her purse, causing it to bleed. The woman said that she&apos;d been 
 celebrating Mother&apos;s Day at her mother&apos;s residence in the Green Valley 
 trailer park and returned home to find the man with a group of friends. 
 This offended her and she ordered everyone out. She denied hitting the 
 boyfriend with her purse but had no explanation how his lip got cut. 
 Witnesses corroborated the man&apos;s story and the woman was arrested for 
 domestic violence. 

 On May 10 at about 7:30 PM, the 
 Sheriff Department received a cell phone report of a possible 
 intoxicated driver heading towards the village on Highway 60. The caller 
 reported that the vehicle had heavy passenger-side damage. Officer 
 Henning intercepted the vehicle near Jackson Drive and observed that it 
 had extensive damage along the entire passenger-side of the vehicle. The 
 23-year-old Town of Trenton man didn&apos;t know how his car got damaged and 
 couldn&apos;t explain where he was going. Witnesses reported that the vehicle 
 had struck the curb on the outskirts of the village, would slow down and 
 then speed up, and almost hit an oncoming car head-on after swerving 
 into the wrong lane. The man failed field sobriety tests and was 
 arrested. A search of the vehicle revealed a marijuana pipe in the 
 center cup holder and an open bottle of malt liquor under the driver 
 seat. The blood test was .21%. 

 At 8:30 PM, a person told Officer 
 Borkowski that he was concerned that an eight-year-old boy was being 
 physically abused by his parents. After collecting the information, 
 Officer Borkowski and Officer Foeger went to the residence to speak to 
 the parents. The man stated that he&apos;s been unemployed for about two 
 years and is taking out his frustrations on his family. There was no 
 evidence of child abuse but the officers provided information on 
 available resources from local social service providers. The man&apos;s wife 
 was not pleased with the officers presence even after they explained 
 that such reports must be investigated. 

 On May 12 at 8:30 AM, a woman told 
 Officer Fristed that a construction worker next door was continuously 
 yelling profanities at his coworkers, and she was afraid her children 
 were going to hear this. The same crew had been warned the previous week 
 about such behavior by Officer Gerke but the situation had actually 
 escalated since then. A video recorded by the woman showed the man 
 throwing his arms up in the air and throwing pieces of wood and other 
 objects around while he yelled at the other workers, who happened to be 
 his brothers. Because she recorded the incident from inside the home, 
 she reluctantly had to describe the language being used. Basically, it 
 involved using the f-word as both an adjective to describe his brothers 
 and the quality of their work, and as a noun to refer to his brothers. 
 The 41-year-old Kewaskum man was cited for disorderly conduct. 

 That morning, a 45-year-old Port 
 Washington man told Det. Bloedel that he had purchased a cell phone 
 after seeing an ad on Craigs List. When he tried to activate the phone, 
 Verizon told them that it was stolen. Using a variety of investigative 
 resources, Det. Bloedel was able to identify the suspect as a 
 23-year-old Jackson man who was eventually cited for theft. 

 At 2:05 PM, Det. Bloedel assisted a 
 Waukesha PD detective in recovering property from a Stonewall Drive 
 address in connection with an identity theft case. 

 On May 14 at 11:26 AM, a Main Street 
 woman reported that a relative was at her home, causing a disturbance 
 and refusing to leave. Det. Bloedel and Officer Laabs responded but the 
 suspect had already left; she was cited for Disorderly Conduct. 

 At 11:40 AM, a West Bend woman told 
 Chief Dolnick that shed been stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on Main 
 Street (due to the village-wide rummage sale). A man driving a pick-up 
 truck got angry, got out of his vehicle, swore at her, pounded on her 
 SUV, and drove off. She followed him to the Jackson Motel, where he has 
 a room. Officer Laabs and Chief Dolnick spoke to the man, who was sober 
 and cooperative. He was apologetic. The complainant did not want to 
 pursue a citation. 

 A local woman told Officer Henning 
 that she was enduring ongoing harassment by a 55-year-old Germantown 
 man. She received information that this man had put her phone number on 
 a wall in a tavern and her daughter recognized the man as he cruised 
 down her street. The woman was told to seek a restraining order. 

 At 9:45 PM, a Slinger man asked 
 Officer Borkowski to check on the welfare of his young daughter, who was 
 staying with his estranged wife. Both the mother and a female friend who 
 was at the residence are alcoholics. The two women had three children in 
 the home and they were fine. The man was told that without specific 
 information that there was a threat to the children, officers could not 
 conduct further checks. 

 On May 16, a local woman reported that 
 her teenage daughter had received photos of a naked adult female on her 
 cell phone. Shortly after, the unknown sender texted an apology and a 
 message that the photos had been sent to the wrong number. Further 
 investigation by Det. Bloedel revealed that the photos were sent by a 
 Sparta woman and that the phone used to belong to the girls biological 
 father. Since there was no criminal intent on the part of the suspect, 
 no charges were issued. 

 On May 17 at 5:10 PM, a Catholic 
 priest told Chief Dolnick that one of his churchgoers had confessed to 
 taking an iPod from a table during the village-wide rummage sale the 
 previous weekend. This person was now guilt ridden, and wanted to return 
 the stolen goods. Based on information given by the priest, Officer 
 Henning was able to find the house that had been selling the iPod, and a 
 resident confirmed that it had been stolen. The next day, Officer 
 Henning traveled to an assisted living facility in Waukesha County, met 
 with the priest and retrieved the iPod, and returned it to its rightful 
 owner. 

 On May 19 at about 8 PM, a 911 caller 
 reported a possible intoxicated driver traveling through the village on 
 Main Street. Officer Henning intercepted the vehicle near Highway P, and 
 he and Officer Foeger followed it into McDonald&apos;s and stopped it. The 
 man was obviously intoxicated and thought that he was at Kettle Moraine 
 Lutheran High School. He insisted he only had the usual&quot;two or three 
 beers&quot;and said he had driven here from the area of 76th and Donges Bay 
 Road. The witness reported that the man had pulled out in front of their 
 vehicle on Highway 60. The witness called 911 after the driver crossed 
 the centerline and almost hit a car head-on. The man failed field 
 sobriety tests and was arrested; the blood test was .14%. 

 On May 20 at 7 AM, Officer Friedl was 
 dispatched to a family disturbance at the Hemlock Street apartment. 
 Although the couple was living together, they were still fighting and in 
 the process of having their marriage annulled. They were also recording 
 each other to document supposed transgressions for the police. The 
 husband became upset that his wife supposedly took money that belonged 
 in his account, so he threatened to call Homeland Security (the woman is 
 a naturalized citizen). The wife viewed this as a&quot;threat&quot;, so she 
 called the police. See May 23. 

 On May 21 at 6:42 AM, a 45-year-old 
 Green Valley man, with whom we are very familiar, reported that his 
 girlfriend was parked in his driveway threatening suicide. For unknown 
 reasons, the man drove to the Sheriff&apos;s Department in West Bend to 
 report this instead of phoning. Officer Fristed found the woman asleep 
 in the car, and she assured him that she was not suicidal, had no 
 intention of harming herself, and never told the man otherwise. The man 
 disappeared from the Sheriff&apos;s Department lobby. His 45-year-old 
 girlfriend, however, was arrested on a warrant from Germantown and taken 
 to County Jail. 

 At about 8 AM, a 46-year-old Green 
 Valley man told Officer Fristed that his 38-year-old niece, with whom he 
 shares a trailer, had just attacked him because he hadn&apos;t returned a car 
 battery and was constantly borrowing money from other people despite the 
 fact that he owed her money. She was arrested for domestic violence. By 
 10:30 AM, the niece had bailed out of jail and returned to her 
 residence. She complained to Officer Fristed that it wasn&apos;t fair that 
 her uncle was hanging around the neighborhood after having her arrested 
 and put in jail. 

 On May 22 at 7 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s 
 Department requested mutual aid for alarm at Cabelas in the village of 
 Richfield; Officer Foeger assisted Deputy Survis. 

 On May 23 just before 6 PM, Piggly 
 Wiggly reported that the manager was chasing a shoplifter through the 
 parking lot. As she arrived, Officer Gerke was flagged down by an 
 off-duty Waukesha County deputy who told her that he had identified 
 himself to the suspect and ordered him to stop running; the man kept 
 going and was somewhere in the marsh. Officer Gerke overtook the man, 
 aimed a TASER at him, and ordered him to the ground. The off-duty deputy 
 covered her with the TASER while she handcuffed the 34-year-old 
 Saukville man. Further investigation revealed that hed stolen $15 worth 
 of snack food. The man said that he recently lost his job and house, and 
 his wife of 11 years left him three weeks earlier. He apologized and 
 claimed he had no way to feed himself other than to steal. He said he 
 had been honorably discharged from the Army two years earlier and hoped 
 to reenlist. The man was issued a citation for the retail theft and his 
 father drove from Saukville to pick him up. Before releasing him, 
 Officer Gerke gave the man contact information for the VA and an 
 organization that specializes in assisting military veterans. 

 On May 24 at 7:30 AM, a resident 
 reported that her 30-year-old son had taken an overdose of sleeping 
 pills and driven away, possibly towards the Jackson Marsh. Later that 
 morning, the man was located at his girlfriend&apos;s apartment. He told 
 Officer Gerke and Det. Bloedel that the girlfriend had recently gotten a 
 job in Wausau and would be moving away. This, plus his own criminal 
 history and addiction to prescription medications, were causing great 
 anxiety. Acute Care Services determined that he was not a candidate for 
 emergency detention and returned him home with a&quot;safety plan&quot;. 

 At 9 PM, the woman from Hemlock Street 
 told Officer Gerke that she had been recording her husband and wanted to 
 report a conversation they had while they were en route to Wal-Mart, 
 during which he supposedly threatened her, again. In listening to the 
 tape, the man said that he would be getting SSI soon and he no longer 
 smokes drugs. There were no threatening comments, again. The woman said 
 she had other recordings of similar conversations. See May 31. 

 On the afternoon of May 26th, an older 
 couple told Chief Dolnick and Officer Gerke that they were having 
 trouble controlling their 39-year-old daughter who suffered from a 
 variety of medical and behavioral issues for many years, and they feared 
 for their safety. Acute Care Services, however, declined to perform a 
 physical placement. The girl returned home but ACS did some follow-up 
 later. 

 On May 31 at 12:30 PM, Officer Fristed 
 was asked to contact a sergeant at the County Jail because the Hemlock 
 Street man wanted to file a child abuse complaint against his wife. 
 Consequently, Officer Fristed was obliged to leave the village to speak 
 to this man. The man said that he was going to contact the news media 
 and Homeland Security because he believed his wife had gone&quot;crazy&quot;since she got her green card. The man had no information to suggest that 
 his child was abused or at-risk. After this incident, Chief Dolnick 
 notified the couple that they were not to request police assistance for 
 unsubstantiated accusations or civil complaints. However, their misuse 
 of police services continued into June.

 Officer Henning: 57-year-old woman, weak and running a high fever. 

       April 22 at 6:30 PM, 
 Officer Henning: 13-year-old girl passed out at the village Mart. 

 On April 1 at 8:48 PM, Officer Henning 
 was asked to check the welfare of a 45-year-old woman after her 
 ex-husband received a call from his children saying that they were 
 unable to find their mother. Officer Henning found that she smelled of 
 intoxicants, had slow and slurred speech, and that her eyes were 
 bloodshot and glassy. Despite these signs, she denied having anything to 
 drink. A field alcohol test revealed a reading of .16%. The husband was 
 notified to pick up the children, and the woman was told that a report 
 would be made to the Department of Human Services. The woman, who has 
 been treated for alcoholism, protested that just because her blood 
 alcohol level was .16 didn&apos;t mean that she was drunk because she 
 handles alcohol better than others. See April 20. 

 On April 2 at 3:38 AM, Officer Laabs 
 and Deputy Miller were dispatched to a Hemlock Street apartment, to keep 
 the peace while a husband packed some belongings to leave. This was the 
 fifth call to the residence for such issues since the couple moved here 
 in January. See April 19. 

 At about 3 PM, Officer Henning was 
 dispatched to Chteau Drive regarding a three-year-old child who was 
 riding a tricycle down the street. Officer Henning found the little boy 
 and gave him a ride in the police car, with instructions to point out 
 his home as they drove. Shortly after, he was flagged down by a 
 distraught woman in a van looking for the child. She explained that the 
 boy was supposed to go to a playmates house a few doors away. When she 
 called that house and was told he never arrived, she went out to look 
 for him. 

 At 6:14 PM, Officer Henning was 
 dispatched to a Spruce Street apartment where a 23-year-old man reported 
 that his live-in girlfriend had driven off after an argument, with their 
 child not in a car seat. The man told Officer Henning that he was upset 
 that the apartment wasn&apos;t clean when he came home. An argument ensued 
 and he put his arms out to hold her back and pushed her to the ground. 
 While this was happening, neighbors next door were pounding and banging 
 on the walls and floor to get them to stop arguing. While en route to 
 the scene, the 25-year-old woman had, herself, contacted Dispatch to 
 file a complaint against the man for trying to strangle her. Based on 
 his initial admission, Officer Henning arrested him for domestic 
 violence. Later, the woman told Officer Henning that during the 
 altercation, the man had put a hand around her neck with his thumb 
 against the trachea, making it difficult for her to breathe, talk, or 
 scream. Although a charge of Strangulation (a felony) was requested, the 
 District Attorneys Office only charged the man with misdemeanor battery 
 and disorderly conduct. See April 6. 

 On April 3 at approximately 3 PM, 
 Officers Henning and Fristed were dispatched to a Green Valley 
 residence, where a hysterical 41-year-old woman feared for her safety 
 because her ex-boyfriend was at the home. The officers found the Green 
 Bay man, along with his wife, attempting to retrieve property pursuant 
 to a court order from January 2010. There was much discussion about 
 bankruptcy and mutual allegations of harassment. Ultimately, the 
 officers were not able to assist in this civil matter other than to tell 
 the man to go back to the courts and not to return because it was 
 causing a disturbance. See April 17. 

 On April 4 at 2:20 PM, a 35-year-old 
 Hemlock Street man told Officer Henning that he wanted to file a 
 complaint against the mother of his child, alleging that she obstructed 
 police investigations and for trying to entice him into creating an 
 incident. The man also wanted to reopen his 2009 arrest for domestic 
 violence/disorderly conduct in which she was the victim. Officers have 
 been dealing with this couple for several weeks over allegations of 
 unwanted e-mails and text messages. See April 13. 

 At 6:30 PM, Officer Henning delivered 
 a death notification to a resident regarding the suicide death of a 
 relative in Port Washington. 

  On April 5 at 3:18 AM, Officer Laabs 
 observed a man walking through the parking lot of the Main Street Mart 
 and recognized him as the subject of an Attempt to Locate message from 
 Germantown PD. The man had gotten into an argument with his wife and 
 walked away from their car, and it was only necessary to check on his 
 welfare. Officer Laabs gave the man a lift to a motel in West Bend. 

 On April 6 at 1:15 PM, a woman came to 
 the station to express her concern about a 54-year-old resident who had 
 not attended her AA meeting. She also said that the woman had admitted 
 recently coming off of a three day&quot;drinking binge&quot;. The subject is well 
 known to us from previous incidents in which she had to be taken to the 
 hospital due to her alcohol intoxication. Officer Gerke and Officer 
 Fristed went to the woman&apos;s house but were unable to get a response at 
 the door. Based on information at that time there was insufficient cause 
 to make a forced entry. However, at about 4:15 PM Chief Dolnick received 
 a call from the woman&apos;s social worker, who said that she had warned the 
 woman a day earlier that the police would be asked to check on her 
 welfare if she didn&apos;t answer her phone. She verified that the woman was 
 drinking again and, based on past history, could be a danger to herself 
 if intoxicated. Officer Gerke, Officer Foeger and Chief Dolnick returned 
 to the residence and, after again getting no response at the door, broke 
 a small window in order to reach the deadbolt and unlock the front door. 
 The woman was found in her bed, extremely intoxicated (.35%), and had 
 urinated on herself. Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched to convey her to 
 the hospital. The woman was combative at the hospital, so the officers 
 had to remain there for the five hours it took for her blood alcohol 
 level to get low enough so they could then transport her to a facility 
 in Milwaukee. 

 At 2:13 PM, Officer Foeger and Officer 
 Gerke kept the peace while the suspect in the domestic 
 violence/strangulation retrieved property from the apartment. While 
 there, the man asked if he could take their six-year-old son with him. 
 Understandably, the woman refused and he was told to contact an 
 attorney. 

 On April 9 at 2:24 PM, Officer Henning 
 delivered a death notification to a resident regarding his aunt who had 
 passed away in Langlade County. 

 At 4:20 PM Officer Henning assisted a 
 deputy who had located a suicidal subject at the Main Street Mart. 

 On April 10 at 7 PM, Officer Henning 
 discovered that a vehicle that had passed him on Highway 45 was being 
 operated by a revoked driver with an Ignition Interlock Device 
 restriction. Although the driver kept looking in the rearview mirror as the squad followed with its lights and siren activated, she continued 
 to drive north on Highway 45. Officer Henning continued to follow the 
 vehicle as it exited at Pleasant Valley Road and entered the parking lot 
 for St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital. The woman was arrested without incident and 
 was found to be in possession of various narcotics for which she had no 
 prescription. She was booked in the County Jail for fleeing an officer, 
 possession of Schedule II controlled substances, driving while 
 revoked/OWI related, and failure to install an IID. 

 On April 13 at 12:44 AM, Officer Laabs 
 and Officer Borkowski were dispatched to a Green Valley residence 
 regarding a 59-year-old man who was extremely intoxicated. His ex-wife 
 and daughter reported that the man had been released from the VA 
 Hospital after treatment for intoxication. The man was barely able to 
 stand and was talking with heavily slurred speech. His behavior wavered 
 between being calm and having fits of rage. When he sat down on his bed, 
 he reached underneath and pulled out a can of beer but was told he 
 couldn&apos;t have it. Acute Care Services was notified and placement was 
 arranged in Fond du Lac. After medical clearance at the hospital, the 
 officers left for Fond du Lac at about 5 AM, returning to the police 
 department at approximately 7 AM. 

 At about 4 PM, Officer Fristed and 
 Chief Dolnick were dispatched to a domestic violence in-progress at a 
 Green Valley residence. A 40-year-old man was detained as he was walking 
 from the area. He said that he had left after getting into an 
 altercation with his wife because she would not give him the checkbook. 
 He tried to grab the keys to her van in hopes that she would exchange 
 the checkbook for them. She responded by slamming the door on his arm, 
 grabbing him by the back of the shirt, and yanking his hair. The shirt 
 was stretched at the neck and the man had a knot on his arm where it had 
 been slammed in the door. Officer Foeger arrived to assist, and 
 eventually the 32-year-old woman was arrested for domestic violence. 

 At 8:45 PM, the ex-girlfriend of the 
 35-year-old Hemlock Street man told Officer Foeger and Officer Borkowski 
 that he had come to the home to pick up the children, parked at the end 
 of the driveway, and spit a large amount of tobacco juice on the 
 driveway. He then returned to pick up their daughter&apos;s iPod and then 
 drove away yelling F*** you and making an obscene gesture. He then 
 returned about 10 minutes later, stopped his truck, grabbed a suitcase 
 and threw it on the front lawn of the residence. He was cited for 
 disorderly conduct. 

 On April 14 at 7:20 AM, a Main Street 
 woman told Officer Friedl that she heard a noise in the fireplace and 
 when she looked up the chimney, a raccoon was looking down at her. 
 Officer Friedl confirmed that the critter was still in there and 
 requested the assistance of the fire department, which was able to get 
 it out. 

 At 6 PM, Deputy Parkinson stopped an 
 intoxicated driver in the McDonald&apos;s parking lot, and Officer Foeger 
 went to assist. After arresting the 27-year-old man, Officer Foeger was 
 asked to go to his grandmothers residence in Green Valley in hopes that 
 she could pick the man up after his chemical test. Grandma could be seen 
 looking through the window at the officer but refused to open the door. 

 On April 15 at 1:15 PM, an anonymous 
 caller reported numerous cats were roaming free in the area of 
 Stonehedge Drive and probably originating from the farm property that 
 was annexed to the village on Sherman Road. Officer Gerke made contact 
 with the owners son and he promised to round up the cats and relocate 
 them to another farm well outside of the village. 

 At about the same time as the above 
 complaint came in, Chief Dolnick received information of a possible&quot;cat 
 hoarding&quot;situation at a Hickory Lane home. In July 2009, Officer Gerke 
 had removed about a dozen cats from the garage and yard of that 
 residence. Officer Gerke and Building Inspector Micech could smell the 
 strong odor of ammonia, consistent with that of cat urine, as they 
 approached the house despite all the windows and doors being closed. The 
 61-year-old woman told them that there were only two cats in the house. 
 The woman refused to let them inside the house and said that her 
 69-year-old roommate was sleeping and could not be disturbed. About an 
 hour later, they returned and were able to speak to the man as he worked 
 outside. He allowed them inside, and Officer Gerke and Inspector Micech 
 were shocked at what they saw. Litter boxes filled with urine and feces 
 were scattered around the house; plates of cat food were everywhere; 
 urine soaked cardboard had been placed in an unsuccessful attempt to 
 protect the carpeting and walls; there was diarrhea on the walls; piles 
 of cat feces were on the steps going to the basement; and there was 
 fecal matter on furniture. Officer Gerke reminded the man that he had 
 been told two years earlier that he was only permitted to have two cats 
 unless he received a Conditional Use Permit from the village. See April 
 18. 

 On April 16 at 8:25 AM, Officer Gerke 
 stopped a vehicle on Main Street after determining that the registration 
 was suspended for unpaid parking tickets. While talking to the 
 22-year-old Fond du Lac woman, the officer could smell the odor of burnt 
 marijuana. After having the driver step out of the vehicle, she could 
 see marijuana on the floor. A search revealed additional marijuana in 
 the center console along with a glass smoking pipe. The woman was cited 
 and released. 

 At 9:10 AM, Officer Gerke was 
 dispatched to a S. Center Street apartment where a 21-year-old man 
 reported that his ex-girlfriend had kicked a hole in the wall and 
 scratched his television; Deputy Schleif assisted. The man said that his 
 girlfriend wasnt there when he got home at 1 AM. He was awakened at 
 about 7:30 AM to the sound of the girlfriend throwing his clothes around 
 the bedroom, breaking a lamp in the process. When confronted, she 
 started ripping posters off the living room walls, grabbed his cell 
 phone and threw it over the apartment balcony, broke a clock in the 
 living room, broke his cigarettes, knocked the television set over, and 
 kicked a hole in a wall. Deputy Schleif stopped the woman as she drove 
 near the residence. She said that the man had come home at about 3 AM 
 and was heavily intoxicated. He tried to prevent her from leaving the 
 apartment, threw her clothes over the balcony, grabbed her by the neck 
 and threw her head into a wall, and threw a cell phone at her (causing a 
 bruise). She then left and stayed at a friend&apos;s home, returning at about 
 8 AM to retrieve her belongings. The man woke up, grabbed her cell phone 
 and threw it against the wall and then over the balcony. She then broke 
 his cigarettes, grabbed her clothing and left. The man kicked a dent in 
 the driver&apos;s side door of her vehicle, and she retaliated by&quot;keying 
 his vehicle. She then returned to the apartment to get the remainder of 
 her belongings, during which the man continued to throw her possessions 
 around, provoking her to rip the posters off the wall. He then kicked a 
 coffee table towards her, causing her to fall and punch a small hole in 
 the wall. She then kicked the wall, making the hole bigger. Both 
 subjects were arrested for Disorderly Conduct/Domestic Violence. 

 On April 17 at 12:20 PM, a 49-year-old 
 man complained that his ex-girlfriend was refusing to return property to 
 him. This was the same woman who was involved in a civil matter 
 involving another ex-boyfriend on April 3. In this case there were 
 mutual allegations of harassment and threats, and changing stories over 
 what was said and what property was involved. 

 At 9:55 PM, a Georgetown Drive 
 resident asked for assistance with neighbors who were having a noisy 
 birthday party. At 9 PM, he had asked them if they could quiet down soon 
 because he had to go to work the next morning. They had promised to do 
 so after 20 minutes. Officer Borkowski spoke to the 32-year-old 
 intoxicated neighbor and he agreed to keep things quiet. However, 
 Officer Foeger returned to the residence at about 1 AM in response to 
 another complaint. This time, he was met by the neighbors wife who was 
 also intoxicated, argumentative and profane. However, when told that a 
 citation would be issued for disorderly conduct, she asked Officer 
 Foeger to speak to the neighbors. Later, the complainants agreed to let 
 a warning suffice. 

 At 10:08 PM, Officer Borkowski and 
 Officer Foeger were dispatched to a Main Street residence where a 
 17-year-old girl had threatened to commit suicide using a razor blade 
 and then slashed her forearms. The teenager was eventually placed at an 
 inpatient facility. 

 On April 18 at 7:09 AM, Officer Gerke 
 and Deputy Kapla were dispatched to a Jackson Drive residence for 
 assistance with an out of control 16-year-old. The problem began when 
 the mother yelled at him for taking too long in the shower. He yelled 
 back, so the mother took away his cell phone. There was more yelling 
 back and forth and the boy pushed his mother against the kitchen 
 counter. The same youth had previously been taken to the hospital after 
 smoking synthetic marijuana and had caused a disturbance in Jackson 
 Park. The boy was cited for possession of tobacco and then turned over 
 to the Department of Human Services for temporary physical custody. 

 At 1 PM, Officer Gerke and Building 
 Inspector Micech returned to the residence on Hickory Lane with the 
 Washington County Humane Society for the purpose of removing the cats. 
 Ultimately, ten adult cats, seven kittens, and three deceased kittens 
 were removed. It was determined that the occupants had previously 
 removed additional cats to various Humane Society organizations in 
 adjacent counties, for a total of 30 unlicensed cats that had been 
 inside the home. The Village of Jackson worked with the Washington 
 County Health Department and the County Attorney to create documents 
 that would trigger the condemnation of the home if the owners were 
 unable to make it safe to live in. The stench of cat urine permeated 
 every object inside the home. See April 29. 

 On April 19 at 8:26 AM, a S. Center 
 Street resident requested assistance from Officer Gerke with her 
 out-of-control 10-year-old son. 

 At 12 PM, Officer Gerke assisted the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department with a vehicle run-off on Highway P south of the 
 village limits. 

 At 1:22 PM, a Stonewall Drive man 
 called from Illinois and claimed that his girlfriend had driven off with 
 his vehicle. He had been unable to find her on the cell phone and his 
 father drove past their condo and reported that the vehicle wasn&apos;t 
 there. However, she has had permission to drive the vehicle in the past. 
 He was told that there wasn&apos;t anything to justify a stolen report based 
 on the lack of information as to her intent and whereabouts, as well as 
 the short timeline. In fact, she called the complainant later that day 
 to say that she had taken a trip to Wisconsin Dells and would be back in 
 a couple of days. 

 At 3:35 PM, Officer Gerke assisted the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department a vehicle in the ditch on Sherman Road east of the 
 village. 

 At 11:15 PM, the 41-year-old man on 
 Hemlock Street called to report that his wife had possibly hit their 
 four-year-old son in the eye and had used a belt on his leg previously. 
 However, there was nothing to substantiate the allegation, including no 
 marks on the boy that matched what was being alleged. The Department of 
 Human Services was notified, however no further action was found to be 
 warranted. 

 On April 20 at about 5 PM, new tenants 
 at a duplex were removing the previous occupants belongings and 
 discovered a hypodermic needle. They told Officer Gerke that no other 
 paraphernalia had been found. The previous occupants were well known to 
 us and credibly suspected of being heavy drug users. 

 At about 6 PM, Officer Henning and 
 Officer Gerke monitored a broadcast from the Sheriff&apos;s Department that 
 the 45-year-old Stonewall Drive woman had picked up her children from a 
 day care center in the Town of Addison. The staff believed that she was 
 intoxicated and only released the children to her because she was 
 accompanied by a sober male. However, this man was suspected of being a 
 51-year-old Green Bay man who was currently on parole and under orders 
 not to be in Jackson or in the company of the woman. The next day, Chief 
 Dolnick notified the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families 
 regarding the facilitys release of the children to an intoxicated 
 parent. At 8:40 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to meet the husband 
 of the woman who, by coincidence, needed to drop off property and wanted 
 an officer there to prevent problems. Upon arrival on Stonewall, he 
 observed that the woman was, indeed, badly intoxicated; she refused to 
 submit to a field breath test. The Green Bay man was also there, and 
 Officer Henning took him into custody for violating his probation. 

 On April 22 at about 11 PM, Slinger PD 
 requested mutual aid for a family trouble complaint, where a 16-year-old 
 girl was out of control and intoxicated. Officer Foeger responded. 

 On April 23 at about 7 PM, Officer 
 Henning stopped a vehicle on Main Street after determining that the 
 registered owner had a suspended license and numerous warrants for her 
 arrest; Deputy Survis was dispatched to assist. When the 27-year-old 
 Slinger woman opened the glove box to retrieve her insurance card, 
 Officer Henning observed a black nylon case. Based on his training and 
 experience, he knew that such cases are often used to store marijuana 
 pipes and other paraphernalia. She retrieved the case and opened it at 
 the officer&apos;s request, and it was found to contain loose marijuana and a 
 glass pipe. After she was arrested, a search of the vehicle revealed 
 Oxycodone, amphetamines, and a 
 plastic straw used for snorting cocaine which had white powder residue 
 in it. She was conveyed to the County Jail and held on charges of 
 possession of a Schedule II narcotic, possession of amphetamines, 
 possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. 

 On April 24 at about 11 PM, the Main 
 Street Mart told Officer Borkowski that an unknown subject had grabbed 
 three cartons of cigarettes valued at $216 off the counter and fled out 
 the door and into an unknown vehicle. Further follow-up by Detective 
 Bloedel resulted in the identification of the suspect and two 
 accomplices, but the case remains under investigation. 

 On April 26 at 8:30 PM, Officer Foeger 
 met with a 75-year-old Green Valley woman who had a verbal argument with 
 her daughter and son-in-law, who had since left. The woman had signed 
 papers giving her daughter Power of Attorney over her affairs, and she 
 felt that the daughter was trying to&quot;take control of my life&quot;and put 
 her in a nursing home. 

 On April 27 at 8 AM, Officer Gerke 
 observed a 24-year-old woman, who she knew to be wanted for probation 
 violation, sitting in front of a room at the Jackson Motel. Detective 
 Bloedel arrived and the two of them knocked on the door of the motel 
 room, with no response. Officer Gerke was about to contact the manager 
 for a key, but Detective Bloedel was able to convince the woman to come 
 out and she was arrested. 

 At 8:04 PM, Officer Henning was 
 dispatched to investigate a teenage male who was mooning people at 
 Jackson Park, however no one was located. 

 At 8:13 PM, Officer Henning assisted a 
 deputy who stopped a person with two warrants on a Highway 45 off ramp. 

 On April 28 at about 9:30 AM, the 
 Saukville Police Department broadcast an alert for a stolen vehicle that 
 had been taken from a business by an employee who had just been fired. 
 Although it was thought that the vehicle would be heading towards West 
 Bend on Highway 33, at about 10 AM Saukville advised that the suspect 
 lived on Francis Drive in Jackson and the business owner had just called 
 them to report that the vehicle was in the driveway. The man was taken 
 into custody without incident, and he protested that he had only taken 
 the vehicle to empty it of his personal property. A Saukville officer 
 arrived and issued him a disorderly conduct citation, but did not pursue 
 a stolen vehicle charge. 

 At 9:18 PM, Officer Henning stopped a 
 vehicle on Main Street after determining that the registration was 
 suspended for unpaid parking tickets and the owner had a revoked 
 license. The driver, a 23-year-old Milwaukee man, was not the registered 
 owner, but Officer Henning could smell burnt marijuana emanating from 
 the vehicle; Officer Krueger arrived to assist. The driver was found to 
 have a suspended license. When asked, all of the occupants denied having 
 any marijuana or drug paraphernalia on them. While talking to the driver 
 outside of the vehicle, Officer Henning could smell the odor of burnt 
 marijuana on his clothing. A search revealed a marijuana pipe with 
 residue. One passenger, an 18-year-old woman from Colgate, was found to 
 have marijuana and two marijuana pipes. An open bottle of beer was found 
 under the driver seat, as well. Ultimately, numerous citations were 
 issued. 

 On April 29, Officer Gerke returned to 
 the house on Hickory Lane to serve in abatement order from the County. 
 As she walked up to the front door, she observed the female occupant 
 carrying two black cats. Officer Gerke knew that only one of the two 
 licensed cats for that home was black, the other being white and orange. 
 After being allowed inside by the man, she determined that three new 
 strays had been taken into the home after the April 18 removal. Once 
 again, the Washington County Humane Society came to the residence to 
 remove the cats. At the same time, the woman claimed she had chest 
 pains, so Jackson Fire Rescue was dispatched to take her to the 
 hospital. Subsequent inspections of the residence revealed that the 
 owners had made significant progress in removing contaminated carpeting 
 and possessions, repainting the walls, and sealing the flooring. The 
 litter box odor was still present, however not nearly to the extent 
 that it had been. 

 On April 30 at about 5 PM, Officer 
 Fristed was called to a Georgetown Drive apartment due to an 11-year-old 
 boy who was out of control.

 On March 
 2 at 7:07 PM, Officers Foeger and Gerke were called to a Ridgeway Drive 
 apartment where a couple had gotten into an argument over the amount of 
 time the children were spending at the Boys and Girls Club. The argument 
 had gotten so raucous that a neighbor called for the police. The two 
 were warned that they would be arrested for disorderly conduct if this 
 continued. 

 On 
 March 4 at 10:11 PM, Officer Krueger responded to a rollover crash on 
 Highway 45 south of Highway 60. He found the vehicle on its side 
 blocking both southbound lanes. He asked the Sheriff&apos;s Department to 
 close the highway and divert traffic off at Highway 60. Officer Krueger 
 rendered aid to injured occupants until the fire department arrived; he 
 then assisted the Sheriff&apos;s Department. 

 At 
 11:32 PM, Officers Krueger and Laabs responded to a family trouble at a 
 Green Valley residence, where a 15-year-old was arguing with his mother. 
 In previous incidents, the youth had been arrested for battery, 
 disorderly conduct, and drug possession. He was warned that any further 
 problems that night would result in his arrest. 

 On 
 March 5 at 3:01 PM, Officer Gerke was dispatched to Highway 45 after the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department received a call of a vehicle traveling at a high 
 rate of speed and deviating from its lane. There were no deputies in the 
 area. Officer Henning was already on Highway 45 on a traffic stop and 
 observed the vehicle pass at around 85 mph. Officer Gerke caught up to 
 the vehicle as it approached Highway 145 in Richfield and followed it 
 with lights and siren activated while she paced it at 85 mph. The 
 24-year-old Greenfield woman finally stopped south of Highway 145. She 
 apologized, stating that she didn&apos;t realize the officer was behind her 
 and may have been distracted while talking on her cell phone; she was 
 cited. 

 On 
 March 5 at 8:05 PM, Officer Krueger was asked to check on the welfare of 
 one of his children who was staying with his estranged wife because of 
 her alcoholism. No one answered at the residence. Because there was no 
 evidence to indicate that they were either home or she was actually 
 intoxicated, nothing further could be done. 

 On 
 March 6 at 3:23 PM, Officer Henning stopped a vehicle on Highway 45 
 after determining that the registration was suspended. A passenger 
 provided different spellings of his name, middle initials, and dates of 
 birth, and Officer Henning asked Officer Gerke to stand by at the scene. 
 After the man was directed to step out of the vehicle and stay with 
 Officer Gerke, Officer Henning asked the occupants who the man was. When 
 they all claimed that they just met him, Officer Henning pointed out 
 that he&apos;d kissed one of them as he got out of the vehicle. They were 
 warned that they faced arrest if they continued to lie, and sat 
 silently. When they were instructed to exit the vehicle, they suddenly 
 spoke up and identified the man as a 28-year-old from Green Bay. The man 
 was wanted on warrants from Probation and Parole, Manitowoc County, and 
 West Allis. He apologized for lying, saying that he was looking for 
 cracks in the system to escape being arrested. He was sent to the 
 District Attorney for charges of obstructing, possession of 
 paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana. 

 On 
 March 7 at 5:30 AM, Officers Friedl and Laabs were dispatched to a 
 Spruce Street residence, where a 52-year-old man had been found by his 
 adult daughter, deceased. 

 At 
 10:30 AM, a 35-year-old Hemlock Street man told Officer Friedl that more 
 than a month earlier his ex-girlfriend picked up their kids on February 
 3 during a snowstorm. He felt that this was foolish, an argument broke 
 out, and she allegedly pushed him into a snow bank. She also allegedly 
 manhandled the children on the way out. When asked why he waited so long 
 to report this, he said the Sheriff&apos;s Department had told him that he 
 had 28 days to report domestic abuse (that time limit had elapsed). 
 While that is correct, Officer Friedl pointed out that normally someone 
 would report such abuse immediately especially if children were 
 involved. The man then related a series of complaints about how he has 
 been treated unfairly by the Police Department including when he was 
 arrested two years ago. No further action was taken. See March 22. 

 On 
 March 8 at 7:40 AM, Officer Friedl was called to a Chestnut Court 
 apartment, where a 15-year-old girl was refusing to go to school. 

 At 9 
 PM, the Sheriff&apos;s Department requested mutual aid for a traffic crash on 
 Pleasant Valley Road, for which no deputies were close. Upon arrival, he 
 found a one vehicle crash with a 24-year-old woman at the wheel. He 
 stood by until deputies arrived and the woman was arrested by them for 
 driving while intoxicated. 

 On 
 March 11 at 4:30 PM, Officer Gerke checked on the welfare of a couple on 
 Hemlock Street who had not been heard from in over a week and a half. 
 Although no one was home, a fellow tenant reported that he had spoken 
 with the couple a day or so earlier. See March 15. 

 On 
 March 12 at 12:45 AM, Officers Borkowski and Krueger were dispatched to 
 a Ridgeway Drive apartment building regarding loud music. As the 
 officers approached the building, they could hear the music coming from 
 a particular apartment so loudly that glass was rattling. They were met 
 at the door by the 24-year-old tenant. When the officers attempted to 
 explain why they were there and that the man needed to turn the music 
 down, the man became belligerent and kept asking who complained. He was 
 told that the complainant was anonymous, but it didn&apos;t make any 
 difference because they themselves could hear how loud the music was. 
 The man was visibly intoxicated, argumentative, and profane. He was told 
 that he would be receiving an ordinance citation and had to be told 
 several times to go back inside his apartment. As the officers walked 
 outside, the man went to a porch and began yelling at other tenants,&quot;You f***ing called the police on me? and other pleasantries. For this, 
 the man was taken into physical custody for disorderly conduct. For the 
 entire transport to the County Jail, he continued to yell derogatory 
 remarks and threats at Officer Borkowski. 

 On 
 March 15 at about 11 PM, Officer Laabs and Deputy Frankow were 
 dispatched to the Hemlock Street apartment, where the 32-year-old woman 
 was claiming that her husband was threatening to steal the kids. It was 
 determined that the woman was suffering from an uncontrolled mental 
 illness of recent vintage. They had just returned from a Florida trip 
 during which she had to be hospitalized after getting out of control. 
 The woman made arrangements to stay with a family friend in Brown Deer. 

 On 
 March 16 at 8:35 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to a Center Street 
 apartment building regarding an out of control 13-year-old boy. The boy 
 alleged that he has been bullied repeatedly at school and physically 
 abused by his mother. The mother denied physical abuse but said there 
 had been some incidents. She also believes her son has been smoking 
 marijuana. A caseworker from Acute Care Services arrived to assess the 
 situation for possible services. 

 On 
 March 17 (St. Patricks Day) at 3:13 PM, the Sheriff Department received 
 a 911 call of a possible intoxicated driver southbound on Highway 45 
 near the village. At that moment, the vehicle was passing Officer 
 Henning. The driver was a 22-year-old West Bend man who denied having 
 any alcohol to drink. The witness, who also stopped, stated that the man 
 had passed her vehicle at a high rate of speed and was weaving across 
 the lanes of traffic. Officer Fristed and Deputy Mitchell arrived to 
 assist. The man failed field sobriety tests including a field breath 
 test of .19%. The man didn&apos;t cooperate when placed under arrest and 
 Deputy Mitchell had to help Officer Henning handcuff him. The passenger 
 was also intoxicated, so a tow truck was called to the scene. The driver 
 had become increasingly agitated and profane, so Officer Fristed and 
 Trooper Perales met Officer Henning at the hospital. While still in the 
 squad car, the man kept interrupting when Officer Henning tried to read 
 the&quot;Informing the Accused&quot;form, saying,&quot;I don&apos;t give a f*** what you 
 are saying, so stop f***ing saying that. You&apos;re a piece of s***. Yup, 
 that&apos;s me, that&apos;s me, that&apos;s me, that&apos;s me, that&apos;s me, that&apos;s me. Read 
 fast you mother f*****, who taught you how to f***ing read?. Once at 
 the hospital, the man physically resisted the officers and had to be put 
 into a compliance hold and walked inside. Inside, he continued to 
 physically resist and had to be held down. At one point he tried to 
 head-butt Trooper Perales. The man&apos;s behavior disturbed patients in 
 other rooms. As he was being escorted out of the hospital, after blood 
 was drawn, the man claimed that the officers had broken hisf***ing 
 pinkie. When asked if he wanted to receive medical attention, he 
 replied, F*** you , Im not paying for it. The man was held at the 
 County Jail for 12 hours and cited for disorderly conduct in addition to 
 a criminal charge for his second OWI offense. The blood test was .20%. 

 Shortly 
 after 8 PM, Officer Henning observed a vehicle pass through a stop sign 
 and followed it to the parking lot in front of Jimmy&apos;s Restaurant, where 
 it suddenly stopped and backed into his squad car. The 37-year-old West 
 Bend man was arrested by Trooper Perales for driving while intoxicated. 

 On 
 March 19, shortly before midnight, a caller reported that an intoxicated 
 woman had fallen down the stairs while leaving Links Hideaway and then 
 drove away on Main Street with the lights out. Detective Bloedel, who 
 was working in uniform that night, spotted the vehicle at Jackson Drive 
 and observed it weaving and speeding. The driver ignored his emergency 
 lights and siren and kept driving eastbound out of the village. 
 Detective Bloedel was joined by Officer Borkowski and Sgt. Kemps of the 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department. The 25-year-old Jackson woman finally pulled over 
 east of Maple Road. The woman failed field sobriety tests and was 
 arrested for her first offense of OWI. While at the hospital, the woman 
 claimed that Officer Borkowski,&quot;must hate vaginas because she hates 
 me. She also commented that Detective Bloedel was left-handed, and she 
 was afraid of left-handed people. The blood test was .24%. 

 On 
 March 20 at 3 AM, Officer Borkowski observed a vehicle parked on the 
 side of Highway 45 South of the village and decided to check on their 
 welfare. She discovered that the driver, a 24-year-old Hartland woman, 
 was intoxicated. A Sheriff&apos;s Deputy was dispatched and ultimately 
 arrested her for driving while intoxicated. Officer Borkowski remained 
 on the scene until the tow truck removed the vehicle and then gave the 
 woman&apos;s passenger a ride to the Pioneer Plaza truck stop. 

 At 4:34 
 PM, Officer Gerke was dispatched to a Hemlock Street location, where a 
 29-year-old Milwaukee woman needed the police because her 10-year-old 
 daughter refused to exit the vehicle to spend the week with her father. 
 Officer Gerke calmed the girl down and peace was restored. However, a 
 routine inquiry revealed that Mom was wanted by the Monroe Police 
 Department for defrauding a landlord. She was arrested and taken to jail 
 on $600 bond. 

 At 
 10:14 PM, Officer Borkowski and Officer Krueger arrested a 19-year-old 
 West Bend man who was wanted by that department for a domestic violence 
 incident. The man knew that the officers were coming and he surrendered 
 without incident at a Chestnut Court location. 

 On 
 March 22 at 8:10 PM, Officer Krueger met with the Glen Hill Drive woman 
 who said she was having difficulties with her ex-boyfriend again. The 
 man was sending numerous text messages and making phone calls, which 
 were mean and didn&apos;t serve any useful purpose. The man was told that 
 he could be cited for these contacts. The man brought up the snowstorm 
 incident again. The man had other grievances and was told that these 
 would have to be settled either between the parties or they would have 
 to go to court. See March 30. 

 On 
 March 23 at 3:53 PM, Officer Henning was told by a Chestnut Court 
 resident that the mother of her sons baby had borrowed her vehicle the 
 night before, supposedly to visit someone in West Bend, but had not 
 returned. The 21-year-old woman was already on probation for vehicle 
 theft. The complainant agreed to wait before making an official report 
 that the vehicle was, indeed, stolen. See March 24. 

 At 
 about 7:30 PM, the Sheriff Department received a report of a suspicious 
 person who had been inside the garage in the Town of Polk. As there 
 were no deputies close by, Officer Henning responded and found the 
 subject walking on Mayfield Road; Chief Dolnick arrived shortly after to 
 assist. The man was turned over to Sgt. Beres of the Sheriff&apos;s 
 Department. 

 On 
 March 24 at 1:30 AM, the complainant in the stolen theft report told 
 Officer Laabs that she obtained information that the suspect had 
 actually driven her vehicle back to her hometown in Sparta. This was 
 deduced from her Facebook posting, that she was having a great time with 
 two other people, one of whom had just gotten released from jail in 
 Monroe County. Just a few hours later, the Monroe County Sheriff&apos;s 
 Department reported that it had recovered the vehicle and the suspect. 
 It was decided that our charges would be sent to the District Attorney 
 and the suspect would not have to be held. See March 25. 

 On 
 March 25 at 10:44 PM, Officer Laabs and Officer Foeger returned to 
 Chestnut Court, where the complainant in the stolen vehicle case was 
 reporting that the suspect had just shown up to pick up her baby. The 
 woman was immediately arrested on a probation hold. She demanded that 
 the officers give her two-month-old baby, which she had left with the 
 paternal grandmother, to her own mother, who had brought her down from 
 Sparta. The baby&apos;s father is currently incarcerated in Ozaukee County. 
 Officer Laabs stated that since the child was being well cared for and 
 it was late at night, there was no reason to wake up the child. Over the 
 next several days, the woman continued to demand that the police 
 department retrieve the child and turn it over to her mother. Grandma 
 made the same demand of Chief Dolnick and the Department of Human 
 Services. All the parties were told repeatedly that the police 
 department had no authority to decide child custody and would not 
 intercede unless there was some reason to believe that the child was 
 endangered, which was not the situation. A Probation Agent eventually 
 transported the suspect back to Monroe County. 

 On 
 March 26 at 11:30 AM, Officer Friedl met with a Blackberry Circle woman 
 regarding harassment by her neighbor. The man had hung a poster with an 
 advertisement of a condo for sale, comments about the complainant, and 
 he would pay $2000 as a&quot;move-in incentive&quot;if the person promised not 
 to disturb him as the complainant allegedly does. The 49-year-old man 
 had been drinking. When asked to explain what it is that the woman does 
 to disturb him, he was not able to explain. The man was warned for 
 disorderly conduct. Later, a couple told Officer Friedl that the man had 
 slipped a card under their door stating,&quot;I am very tired. Please accept 
 a token of my impact&quot;, along with two gift cards. 

 At 
 about 3 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched back to Blackberry Circle, 
 where the couple mentioned in the above incident said the suspect had 
 now left another note under the door, this time with a picture of dog 
 feces and,&quot;if you don&apos;t clean it up I will call a phone number&quot;, with a 
 piece of paper with the phone number for the Sheriff&apos;s Department. The 
 couple was not responsible for any dog waste the man was seeing. After 
 discovering that the man had just driven away, Officer Henning issued a 
 description of the vehicle to area departments because neighbor said the 
 man had been drinking all day and was highly intoxicated. He also 
 discovered that the man had broken a lawn chair on his patio on the way 
 out. 

 On 
 March 27 at 7:50 AM, Officer Friedl returned to Blackberry Circle, where 
 a neighbor reported continued disturbances by the suspect in the above 
 two complaints. Another card was left under the door; the man was 
 slamming doors and stomping around; and threatened to&quot;destroy&quot;a 
 neighbor who complained. At this time, Officer Friedl arrested the man 
 for disorderly conduct. 

 In the 
 afternoon of March 28, a person reported that several youths were on the 
 roof of the concession stand in Jackson Park, one of whom had defecated 
 on the roof. Officer Foeger located the four teenage boys near the stand 
 and one of them, a 16-year-old Jackson Drive resident, admitted that he 
 had relieved himself in a plastic grocery bag, not on the roof itself, and threw it into a garbage can; Officer Foeger checked the roof to make 
 sure. None of the boys were cited; however all the parents were 
 notified. 

 On 
 March 30 at 8 PM, the Glen Hill Drive woman told Officer Gerke that her 
 ex-husband was again sending harassing texts and e-mails. Shortly after 
 11 PM, Officer Borkowski made contact with the suspect and again warned 
 him to knock it off. About 45 minutes later, the man called Dispatch and 
 demanded that Officer Borkowski meet with him. Instead, Officer 
 Borkowski called him back, which angered the man. He yelled at Officer 
 Borkowski and made a variety of accusations against his ex-wife, all of 
 which were civil in nature. The man wouldn&apos;t stop yelling at Officer 
 Borkowski so she ended the conversation.

 On 
 February 2 at 1:21 PM, Officer Fristed was asked to check the welfare of 
 an 85-year-old Cranberry Creek man who was not answering the telephone. 
 His daughter was concerned because she was certain her father would be 
 home during the snowstorm. However, the man, indeed, was not at home. 

 At 2:39 
 PM, a 34-year-old Jackson man told Officer Foeger that he was receiving 
 harassing phone calls from a friend. The caller was a crack cocaine 
 addict with a history of selling his possessions and then claiming the 
 property was stolen in order to obtain insurance money. The Menomonee 
 Falls man was warned to leave the complainant alone. 

 At 9:33 
 PM, Officer Foeger was asked to check on the welfare of two brothers who 
 shared a Main Street home, after a friend was unable to make telephone 
 contact. The officer was able to see the men through the window but 
 could not gain entry because large snowdrifts had blocked both the front 
 and side doorways. Officer Borkowski arrived and, together, they 
 shoveled the snow from the front door to make it accessible again. Once 
 inside, the men explained that their telephone was out of order, 
 possibly due to the snowstorm, and wouldn&apos;t be repaired for several 
 days. A friend had loaned them a cell phone to use in the meantime but 
 they didn&apos;t know how to use it, so Officer Foeger showed them how. 
 Officer Borkowski left a business card with phone numbers to the police 
 department and the dispatch center in case they needed assistance. 

 On 
 February 3 at 10:18 AM, Officer Fristed assisted a Hartford woman in 
 retrieving property from her ex-boyfriends Center Street apartment. 

 At 
 12:32 PM, a Georgetown Drive man was reportedly suicidal and armed with 
 a rifle. Officers Fristed and Gerke, and Detective Bloedel, arrived and 
 asked Dispatch to make contact and ask the person to come out of the 
 residence without any weapons. The 36-year-old man exited the apartment 
 and was taken into protective custody without incident. When 
 interviewed, the man said that he had been text messaging a friend, 
 during which he had made inferences about harming himself. He was 
 receiving therapy and taking an antidepressant medication, and said that 
 he did not truly intend to harm himself but just wanted attention. A 
 shotgun was found in the apartment, and was temporarily removed for 
 safekeeping. Acute Care Services interviewed the man and determined that 
 he did not need to be placed in emergency detention. 

 At 1 
 PM, a Ridgeway Drive woman told Officer Foeger that she suspected her 
 adult son of stealing her wedding ring to support his addiction to 
 Oxycontin and heroin. The man had been arrested last December by another 
 jurisdiction for burglary and was suspected of stealing property from 
 his sister. Further investigation revealed that the ring had been pawned 
 at a jewelry store in West Bend. Detective Bloedel recovered the ring 
 from that business, along with a transaction record showing that the son 
 had, indeed, pawned it. The complainant then reported that her husband&apos;s 
 wedding band had gone missing the previous summer. Detective Bloedel 
 traced it to another jewelry store where, once again, there was 
 documentation that the son had pawned it. Unfortunately, the wedding 
 band had already been sent to a refinery. On the afternoon of February 
 4, the man was arrested by Officer Foeger. 

 On 
 February 5 at 3:38 PM, an 87-year-old woman was disturbed when an 
 elderly woman left a phone message that she needed help because she was,&quot;locked in here&quot;. After much follow-up, Officer Gerke was able to 
 determine that the caller was a resident of a nursing home in the 
 Milwaukee area who was suffering from dementia. The woman may have been 
 looking for a friend who lives elsewhere, and it&apos;s unknown how she 
 obtained the phone number of the complainant. 

 On 
 February 6 at 2:35 PM, Officer Henning assisted a deputy in the arrest 
 of an 18-year-old Green Valley man for burglary. 

 At 9:47 
 PM, Officer Henning assisted at a three car crash on Highway 45 until 
 the Sheriff&apos;s Department arrived. 

 On 
 February 7 at 7:42 PM, Officers Gerke and Henning were advised to look 
 out for a possible intoxicated driver driving westbound on Highway 60 
 from the Ozaukee County line. Numerous 911 calls were being made by 
 other drivers, reporting that the vehicle was weaving badly. Instead of 
 continuing into the village, the suspect turned north on Highway G. The 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department requested mutual aid, asking the officers to 
 attempt to overtake the vehicle. Officer Henning caught up to the 
 vehicle near Rusco Road and observed that it was still weaving badly 
 over both the center and fog lines. The man denied drinking alcohol but 
 did admit to using prescription pain medication. Two deputies eventually 
 arrived and the matter was turned over to them. 

 On 
 February 9 at 9:38 AM, a 911 caller reported that a vehicle was driving 
 on the wrong side of Highway 60 and then went into the ditch next to the 
 Highway 45 ramp. Officer Fristed, assisted by Detective Bloedel, 
 encountered a 30-year-old Hartford man with droopy eyelids and slurred 
 speech but without any odor of intoxicants. The man failed field 
 sobriety tests and was taken into custody. After blood was drawn, the 
 man was interviewed and said that he had been prescribed Lorazepam. 

 On 
 February 11, a 25-year-old Center Street man told a nurse at the Aurora 
 Health Clinic that he had nothing to live for if he couldn&apos;t have his 
 anxiety medication refilled. The man said that his mother had taken some 
 of his medication in place of her own while he was in jail. Officer 
 Gerke attempted to locate the man, with whom we&apos;ve had many contacts in 
 the past, without success. 

 At 9:17 
 PM, a caller reported a vehicle driving erratically on Highway 45 all 
 the way from Wauwatosa. Officer Foeger initiated a traffic stop near 
 Pleasant Valley Road, and the vehicle promptly drove into the ditch. The 
 35-year-old West Allis man was stuttering and difficult to understand. 
 He said that he was en route to a church located in West Bend and was 
 suffering from anxiety problems due to his pending divorce. The man 
 agreed to contact relatives to pick him up. 

 On 
 February 13 at 9:42 AM, Officer Fristed and Deputy Schleif were 
 dispatched to a family trouble call at a Hemlock Street apartment, after 
 a neighbor reported a possible problem. Upon arrival, a 32-year-old 
 woman walked out and reported that she and her husband had been fighting 
 and arguing, and she just wanted him to leave. Her 46-year-old husband 
 reported that he had been an avid marijuana smoker until his wife 
 confronted him about it and convinced him to throw it and his pipes 
 away. This apparently made their tense relationship even worse. He 
 complained that his wife wants him to leave but then wants him back, and 
 also calls him names. Eventually it was determined that this was only a 
 verbal argument and after getting everyone calmed down the officers 
 departed. 

 At 4:41 
 PM, Officers Gerke and Foeger returned to the above apartment, where the 
 woman was now claiming that her husband would not let her in and was 
 refusing to leave. When they arrived, the woman reported that she 
 believed her husband was still smoking marijuana; however she had been 
 unable to locate either the substance or pipes. The husband said that he 
 allowed the wife back into the apartment; however, he would not leave. 
 The two continued to bicker back and forth, and eventually the husband 
 agreed to stay at a hotel for the night. 

 On 
 February 14 at about 1:30 PM, Officers Gerke and Friedl were dispatched 
 to Green Valley, where a mail carrier said she had been threatened and 
 harassed by a resident. The resident turned out to be an 82-year-old 
 woman who said that she merely questioned why there was a problem with a 
 delivery. She said that she didnt threaten or try to intimidate the 
 45-year-old mail carrier. The woman attempted to apologize to the 
 carrier for the misunderstanding, but the carrier did not seem to accept 
 it. 

 On 
 February 15 at approximately 2 PM, Officer Friedl stopped at a local 
 business to arrest a 29-year-old employee on warrants from West Bend and 
 Jackson, and a probation violation hold. As Chief Dolnick drove to the 
 side of the building, he spotted the man dart out of a door and head 
 towards an open field to the south. Detective Bloedel responded to the 
 area and advised that the man might be heading towards a friends condo 
 on Spruce Court. Chief Dolnick headed towards that area but then the man 
 was spotted by Detective Bloedel hiding behind another business. The man 
 tried to run but was grabbed by Detective Bloedel and ordered down to 
 the ground. Officer Friedl arrived and assisted in securing the man. 

 On 
 February 16 at 6:30 PM, Officer Gerke was dispatched to a Glencoe Lane 
 residence, where an 11-year-old girl was out of control and throwing a 
 temper tantrum because Mom would not help her with homework. Officer 
 Gerke told the girl that throwing a temper tantrum is not the way to get 
 anything accomplished and that she needed to follow the rules of the 
 house, and the instructions of her mother and grandparents. 

 At 7:13 
 PM, Officer Henning was dispatched to a Center Street apartment, where a 
 tenant reported that someone had been inside the house while they were 
 gone. The woman noticed three quarters on her windowsill were missing 
 and there were footprints in the snow leading to the window. Nothing 
 else in the apartment was taken. The landlord was contacted about 
 securing the windows. 

 On 
 February 17, shortly after midnight, a Green Valley woman told Officer 
 Krueger that they had just gotten home after shooting pool when they 
 discovered that a large amount of cash had been removed from a black 
 velvet box in the bedroom. The resident suspected two 18-year-olds who 
 had knowledge of the cash as well as how to enter the trailer. Further 
 investigation by Detective Bloedel resulted in the exoneration of one of 
 those suspects. However the other suspect and a 16-year-old accomplice, 
 both of whom are familiar to us, were eventually arrested for burglary. 

 On 
 February 22, at 12:30 PM, Officer Gerke met with the husband involved in 
 the two February 13 incidents. The man reported that his wife was now 
 confined at a psychiatric hospital in Florida, and a social worker there 
 needed verification of their infant daughter&apos;s welfare. The man had the 
 child with him, and Officer Gerke telephoned the social worker in 
 Florida and verified that the baby was fine. 

 On 
 February 26 at 8:36 PM, Officers Henning, Foeger, and Borkowski were 
 dispatched to a Spruce Street apartment, where a woman reported that her 
 52-year-old father was highly intoxicated and would probably fight when 
 officers arrived. Upon arrival, the woman said that her father had been 
 found passed out in a boat outside of Cabelas earlier that day. The 
 Sheriff&apos;s Department had transported him to Community Memorial Hospital 
 for detox, but after being admitted his brother picked him up and 
 brought him home. After taking a shower, the woman found that her father 
 had consumed half a bottle of vodka and became unresponsive and 
 unconscious. The man was found by the officers totally unresponsive and 
 bleeding from the nose as he sat passed out in a chair. Jackson Fire 
 Rescue was dispatched and transported the man to St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital. 
 Due to the man&apos;s alcohol level, which was measured at .53%, the man was 
 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Unfortunately, after he was 
 released from the hospital the man passed away at home about two weeks 
 later. 

 On 
 February 27 at 8:40 PM, the mother of the woman who had been 
 hospitalized in Florida reported that her daughter had had been 
 released, was off of her medication, and back in Jackson. She cautioned 
 Officer Borkowski that due to her current mental state she might lie 
 regarding incidents between her and her husband. Less than six minutes 
 later, Officers Henning, Borkowski and Foeger were dispatched to the 
 Hemlock Street apartment for an alleged domestic violence case. Prior to 
 their arrival, the husband called Dispatch to report that he had fled 
 from the scene and was waiting to meet with officers at another 
 apartment. Officers Foeger and Borkowski continued to Hemlock Street and 
 Officer Henning detoured to meet with the husband. He told Officer 
 Henning that he, his wife, and their two children had gone to Disney 
 World. While there, an argument broke out and his wife threw one of the 
 children against a chair. He fled the hotel with the children, and his 
 wife ran after them scantily clothed in her underwear and screaming that 
 he was taking her children. Local police were called and his wife was 
 originally committed to a facility in Florida for six months, however 
 after only one day she was released to her husband and they flew back. 
 During the flight, his wife stated that she would not take any of her 
 medications because they made her tired. While driving back from the 
 airport she threatened to jump out of the car if he drove her to a 
 hospital. On this date her condition was deteriorating and when he left 
 the residence she called 911. The husband denied ever striking his wife 
 and said that he was worried for her safety. When interviewed by 
 officers, the woman related numerous unusual stories and allegations, 
 including that she had been gang raped by staff and inmates at the 
 mental health facility. After an interview by Acute Care Services the 
 woman was placed in an inpatient facility.
