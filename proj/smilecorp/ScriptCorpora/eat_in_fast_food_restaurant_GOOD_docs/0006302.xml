We were on a search for delicious wings close to home, and we couldn&apos;t believe we didn&apos;t try this place sooner!  I&apos;m not very picky with wings: as long as the meat is well-marinated, tender, and the sauce delivers the heat, I&apos;m happy.   The wings here definitely exceed these basic expectations, and if you want serious heat, try the atomic.  It was an understatement when they said the atomic wings are &quot;very hot&quot;....I must admit that I couldn&apos;t handle any more after eating three.  I even had to drink milk!  Oh, and they have yummy fries and veggie sticks!

They have this one really great guy/manager who works here (I think we&apos;re all talking about the same guy in our reviews).  He is really friendly and even gave us extra wings when we ordered the atomic.

I don&apos;t mind the lack of napkins here (the world won&apos;t end if you just use their paper towels)...though it does make it tempting for me to lick the sauce off my fingers...but I&apos;ve been told (by my mother) that this is not lady-like.

Is this one of the best wing restaurants in the area? Methinks it is.

This is a fast food restaurant that serves wings. There&apos;s nothing special about the layout. They serve cheap beer here, but they don&apos;t have a tap or a bar. They don&apos;t employ many people, but the service I got here was great. The guy at the counter knew his way in and out of this place and their wings, and frequently checked in with me to see how the meal was.

I&apos;ve had wings from many different restaurants in my life -- Quaker Steak and Lube, Buffalo Wild Wings, countless small restaurants nobody has heard of -- and I can honestly say that these are among my list of the best wings I&apos;ve ever had. I had a 10 boneless wing combo with Teriyaki Sauce and Hickory BBQ Sauce. The wings were large and meaty. The Teriyaki Sauce was average, while the Hickory BBQ Sauce was nothing short of awesome. They claimed that the wings are not kept in storage trays and are fresh, but I know how that this is just a load of crap: they were probably frozen, but they still tasted amazing.

I did find a trash can here, believe it or not. I was amazed. I felt like I had found a leprechaun. However, it was the size of a can of soup. There was no way in hell I could fit my wings or my drink in that measly trash can. You apparently just leave your finished food and drink on the table, and they take it someplace else after you&apos;re done. The tables were clean, though.

If you are looking for amazing wings near Rockville or Gaithersburg, look no further than this place. It&apos;s well worth your time and money.

Let me put this out there, I like this place better than BWW.

The only thing BWW has is more diversity of sauces, food types, bar, and the bar-like atmosphere.  As for food/wing quality, I&apos;d honestly choose wingstop.  It&apos;s more peaceful to eat there as well.

I don&apos;t know what was going on but the week before Thanksgiving they gave AMAZING service.  AMAZING.  I don&apos;t even know, I was caught so off guard and it&apos;s THIS specific Wingstop.  Everyone was real cool and nice.  I never leave a tip when I go to Wingstop but I felt like I just had to.

Good stuff though, I highly recommend this place.

I don&apos;t know where to begin.  You know, instead of my usual 5000 page epic novel - I&apos;m going to have to bulletpoint this one.  Yelp does not give me enough characters to go on the full on rant that this place needs.

1a) The menu is sparse - it&apos;s just wings and boneless wings.  So...why on earth does it take TWENTY MINUTES to get 10 wings? TWENTY MINUTES!  Yes, it was a Sunday, but I&apos;ve also been here on non-football weeknights and the wait never gets less!

1b) To go off of point 1a, this WingStop has been in this location for well over 3 years.  That&apos;s over three years of football Sundays.  Are they seriously telling me that they don&apos;t haven&apos;t analyzed their Sunday ordering patterns?!?  PUL-EASE!  My dad owns a florist, and we only have Valentine&apos;s Day once a year, and I can tell you within a 2% point differential, the call and sales volume for each 15 minute interval.  If the management at this place is really so lame that they can&apos;t figure out that 30-45 minutes prior to kickoff of the first game, there will be a rush and they should probably cook up a bunch of chicken wings and not wait for each individual order to come in before cooking, then hell, they really need to hire someone new.

2) OK, so you know when you order wings at ANY OTHER place in the USA, that you get a little container of bleu cheese or ranch dressing, and a stick or two of celery?  Yeah...at WingStop you have to pay 75 cents!  For a tiny little quarter shot of dressing!!!  HUH?  I can see charging for EXTRA dressing...but charging for the very first container of dressing?  And seriously, 75 cents for two sticks of celery?  Which everyone knows that you only have it with your wings, so that you can say &quot;oh, there&apos;s veggies with it, so it&apos;s healthy&quot;...I mean, it&apos;s like GARNISH.

3) The attitude of the staff has to be experienced to be believed.  It&apos;s as if they are doing us a favor.  Um, no.

4) There are NO TRASHCANS.  ANYWHERE.  IN THE ENTIRE STORE.  I know, I LOOKED.  Repeatedly.  So guess what?  I left my trash on the table, because THERE ARE NO TRASHCANS.  ANYWHERE.  I mean...REALLY?????????????

5) Because there are no trashcans, one would assume that the tables would be bussed and wiped down.  NOPE!  There was a pile of trash on our table a mile-high...covered in grease (as this is a wings place)...and no one came to pick up the trash or to wipe down the table.  Not even when I said &quot;HEY, can someone please come and clear off this table&quot;.

6) The chicken wings themselves are TINY!  Now, yes, I&apos;ve been spoiled by BonChon of late...but even still, I&apos;ve seen bigger wings from a quail.  These suckers were *SMALL*.  And they aren&apos;t cheap.

7) I could and should probably pull a Su K and do a price breakdown per wing, but you know what?  Issues #1a - 6 should be enough to warn you away.  Plus I can&apos;t do math.  But even my non-math doing butt knows that the prices aren&apos;t reflective of quality of the wings.

Okay since then, the place has gotten a little better. The service is a lot faster and the food is fresh due to new management. I see new employees there.

Unfortunately, the wings are almost bite-sized which I am disappointed in but I absolutely LOVE their seasoned fries. It&apos;s salty with a touch of sugar. You must go there and get large fries with their creamy ranch dip! It&apos;s heavenly!

First fell in love with this place when I was in the Army stationed in El Paso, TX.

Customer service at the El Paso location was the best. It got to the point where I would call in and they knew exactly who I was and would take care of my order. Gotta love that. 10 piece original hot and regular fries with EXTRA seasoning.

I will say this about Wing Stop, all though there wings are good and they have plenty of sauces to choose from. There wings are usually a bit small. What makes this place for me is the wonderful seasoned fries. The ranch dressing they use is also great.

I wish I could just get a Wing Stop on my side of the Beltway.

Respect,

This place is the worst place to get wings in MoCo.

We were the only 2 people in the restaurant. We ordered 20 wings. We waited for 40 minutes.

Every time I went over to ask on the status of the wings- I got a scowl from the cashier. I eventually told my husband we should probrably stop asking because they might start spitting (or worse) in our food.

There were like 3 people working in the back- laughing, joking, having a grand old time. I&apos;m glad they were enjoying life while I slowly starved to death waiting for my dinner.

And then- when we FINALLY got our food- there was no blue cheese dip. So, I went to ask for it. The cashier says in an incredibly sarcastic tone: &quot;Uhm you have to pay for that!&quot; --- Well first of all- I actually already HAD- as I then proceeded to show her my receipt...second of all- even if I had NOT--- did I really need the &apos;tude after waiting so long for my food?

PS: It took another 10 min before we got our dipping sauce. By then, we had 5 wings left. Fabulous.

Never again.

oh! PPS: The wings had barely ANY meat on them and they were over done- fried to a crisp and soaking in sauce. Go to Buffalo Wild Wings if you want good wings with lots of flavor options.

This place is awful. The service was terrible. The cashier had a horrible attitude, and the people who brought the food out barely enunciated the names and got mad when people didn&apos;t hear her. Furthermore, when they forgot to give me my ranch dressing (which inexplicably cost .69 more, she grabbed my receipt, as if I was trying to put one over on her.)

The garlic parm wings were terrible, and the original wings were barely passable. Did I mention they took over 13 minutes to make? Avoid this place at all costs. I think the only customers they get are like my group: People who didn&apos;t want to wait for the line at Chipotle. Way to aim for the skies Rockville Wingstop.

Wingstop is a typical wing joint. TVs pumping ESPN. Music playing, probably satellite radio. And a menu that consists of wings, fries, wings, beer, and wings.

The wings are decent, the fries are good (I think they may put a dash of sugar on them) and the portions of both are large.

One good thing about this particular WingStop is that when all the other restaurants in the shopping center are crowded you can usually walk in and get served quickly.

Usually an uncrowded restaurant in a packed shopping center is a bad sign. But I think people don&apos;t consider chicken wings for lunch (I&apos;d eat them for breakfast if I could).

They can be messy and there are certain gastrointestinal consequences when you eat spicy buffalo wings. These may combine to keep a typical cubicle dweller on a lunch break away from the wingy dingys. Most people wouldn&apos;t want to show up for that afternoon meeting with wing sauce on your shirt and a rumbly in your tummy.

Anyway, if you can put your fear aside you can snag a decent lunch for a reasonable price (7 bucks for boneless wing strips, fries, coleslaw, and a drink).

Why are there so many bad reviews??

I agree with Santiago, the service here is awesome!  The guys at the register are always really friendly and helpful.  I go here strictly for the garlic parmesan wings and the fries.  I don&apos;t know what seasoning they use on the fries but they&apos;re sooooooo good!  It&apos;s kinda salty kinda sweet.  Also, the wings aren&apos;t greasy which is a plus!  LOVE &apos;em!

I have to say that their customer service has improved. But why spend $10 on a five piece boneless chicken  meal and can&apos;t get extra celery sticks? Every time I order a five piece boneless chicken meal I always ask for no fries, no carrots and extra celery sticks. I can never get extra celery sticks unless I&apos;m being charged. I would think they are saving money because I don&apos;t want the fries. Wft. Please let me know if that makes sense.

As has been stated repeatedly, the food here is fair and the service could easily be improved.  The guys at the counter act as though they are doing you favor in taking your order, and the place doesn&apos;t have napkins (only a roll of paper towels on the counter) or trash cans.  This is bizarre for a wings place.

What a dud.
I phoned ahead inquiring about time of delivery for a not so big order. I was assured it would take 10-15 minutes. I went online to place the order and even phoned afterwards making sure they got the order. The order was late and wrong when I went to pick it up. The order was not even checked by the manager- btw- it was not even busy!!! I asked how can you have three flavors of wings in two containers, and the manager just looked at me and said &quot;oh&quot;. She offered to correct the order- why bother she was just going to get it wrong again, then she offered to put my name in a book for free wings later- if they have a book- that is a problem!  Don&apos;t bother going to this location not worth the hassle.

I&apos;m a big wing fan...and I know a great one when I see one, however, this place was mediocre compared to other places that I have been to.
First off, I agree with the wait time complaints; I went and it managed to be a 10 min wait time, but the first time I went [earlier this yr] it took almost the entirety of my break time. NOT SO GOOD when you have limit on break.
Secondly, the fries can be a bit extra on the salt...I think I got enough sodium in my system to retain 2 days worth of water.
Anyway, it is a good place--BWW is better with the selection but then again People, this is considered Fast Food NOT a restaurant.

The major complaint I hear is the wait time. They take made-to-order a little too seriously - it can take a while to get your food so I suggest order ahead of time. I call 30 min prior to getting there and my wings are ready for me when I reach Wingstop. The wings are great - fresh chicken wings as is, not too big hence delivering a great crunchy texture. The atomic sauce is the bomb. I get my wings well-done and sauce on the side ALWAYS so it&apos;s never soggy. The fries with salt and sugar are great but they never hold up the crunch after cooling down. Still the only decent place in the area for good wings. Forget about the bready wings at hooters. The name says it all.

I have been going to Wingstop for over 6 years now and while the food has ALWAYS been very good, there was a period from 2007-2009 where the management was awful and the customer service was a joke.

HOWEVER, I went back to Wingstop for the first time in months last Tuesday and in all my time going there, this was my best experience at Wingstop. First, they have a new manager, Brian, who was friendly, quick and brought out my Chicken Strips and Fries EXACTLY in the time he promised (9 minutes). He was able to strike up a fun conversation with me during my wait and kindly brought the order to my table along with a plate. I got two flavors (Garlic Parmesan and Hot) and these two flavors were the most delicious flavors I have had in ALL the wing places I have been. This includes Buffalo Wild Wings, Cluck-U, Wingzone and numerous bars where I&apos;ve had wings. This place beats all those places, period. The fries are also delicious and they have a unique, kinda sweet seasoning on top which brings it all together. Next, for those of you complaining about pricing, it is pretty comparable to most wing places around the area. Buffalo Wild Wings has 6 Wings for $4.79, while Wingstop has 10 for $6.29. Seems like Wingstop has the upper end there. I am a firm believer in that you get what you pay for and for 7-8 bucks, you can enjoy a very filling meal here. Finally, many have talked about the wait for wings here. Yes, it can be a little bit long, but unlike many other wing places where they keep their chicken frozen or already cooked and just heat it up for you when you order it, Wingstop makes all their wings fresh to order. This is why it takes them the 10-15 minutes for your food to come out. Believe me, their wings are worth the wait.

In conclusion, I am a firm believer that this place not only has the best wings you can find in the area, but the pricing is competitive and the customer service/management is now excellent. If you are in the mood for chicken wings, fries and beer, this is the place to go!

Solid place for wings.  Decent sized wings with decent sauce option for reasonable prices (10 wings for $6.95 is a pretty good deal for what you get).  Reliable but not necessarily mindblowing, but it is wings.  The boneless wings/tenders are also a solid deal with the same sauce options.  The tenders are also included in a tenders/fries/drink combo special so I&apos;d definitely come back to take advantage of this deal.  Another up side of this place: open late on the weekends (I think until midnight).  How can you pass up the deals here!

one of the better wing places in the area also the cheapest because theres no waiting services. The wings have a lot more sauce and meat too. the staff is awesome whenever i go in there with my buds we have a great time because of the staff cracking jokes with us. the fries could be better and is why im giving 4 stars instead of 5 but they do give you a good amount of it.

The food is okay.  The service blows.

Don&apos;t expect to get your wings in less than 15 mins.  I understand they say they are made to order, but most places precook their wings when it tends to get busy (like 12:00pm), because it&apos;s simply not productive to wait until people start ordering.  (I&apos;ve had wait problems in all WingStops I&apos;ve encountered -- not just this one.)  Also, I&apos;ve had my order placed wrong in several occasions.  Typically they&apos;ll forget to give you all the dips you ordered.

The good thing about the place is that their wings are tasty.  My favorite is the Cajun, but their Original Hot is also good.  Don&apos;t get Atomic unless you plan on drinking a lot of water and paying for it in the bathroom.   I used to buy Atomics and have my unsuspecting buddies try them.  They&apos;ll never trust me with food again.  If you don&apos;t like spicy, try the BBQ.  Avoid the Lemon Pepper and Parmesan unless you really like that kind of crap on your wings.

The wings are on the small side though and they don&apos;t batter their wings.  Their dips are watered down.  The fries are decent, but they sweeten it with sugar or something...kinda tastes weird.  They&apos;re usually cooked just right though.  I&apos;ve never tried their boneless wings but I&apos;ve heard they&apos;re good.  That&apos;s about it.  Nothing special.

UPDATE: So it&apos;s been about 3 years since I&apos;ve posted this review and I must say they&apos;ve really got their act together.  The last time I ordered there they got my order correctly and well within 15 mins during a busy time.  And for that I bumped the rating from 2 stars to 3.

The wings are average and actually pretty small.  The prices are moderate, but overpriced if you consider the quality of the wings.  The location is clean and the shopping center is quite convenient.  Overall, I&apos;ve had better wings and at better prices.

I will agree that the wings here are pretty small, possibly the smallest I have in a restaurant. I came here looking for a quick meal to go and ordered the 10 wings, fries, and drink &quot;special&quot; which today was $8.99. I think they must just come up with a price everyday for the special by pulling a number out of a hat. The woman at the counter was mad about something before I ordered so that wasn&apos;t the most pleasant exchange and she was fairly rude to be honest. I waited about 20 minutes for the meal, which seemed long for some wings but they were pretty good and the fries were good as well. I haven&apos;t had any desire to come back though because there are too many negatives to outweigh the 1 positive.

NEARLY TWO BILLION WINGS SOLD AND COUNTING!

It&apos;s no wonder we have sold so many wings after wins at the Buffalo Wing Festival 3 years in a row. Wingstop has taken chicken wings to a whole new level by saucing and tossing them in a choice of 9 flavors.

Wingstop is not fast food; our wings are made with care and served up piping hot. Every order is made fresh when you order it; nothing sits under a heat lamp. Our wing fans don&apos;t mind waiting only fourteen minutes for some of the best tasting wings in the country. Our wings are right sized to insure they are always tender, never chewy. We also do not charge you for dips you may not want, but have excellent homemade ranch, bleu cheese and honey mustard available for your pleasure.

In addition to hot fresh wings our sides are all homemade. Fresh Cut Seasoned Fries are cut daily in every restaurant from Idaho Potatoes. If you haven&apos;t tried any of our sides you are missing out.

Call ahead or order online @ www.wingstop.com
 
History
 
 Established in 1994 

Wingstop was founded in 1994 with rich entrepreneurial roots. The chicken wing, not traditionally a desired part of the chicken, quickly became a craved favorite. After successfully creating a niche in chicken dining, Wingstop began franchising in 1997.

Wingstop continues that success, with over 600 locations currently operating or in development. Reaching No. 1 in the chicken-wing category for Entrepreneur Magazine and reaching No. 5 in the top 25 New Franchises.

Made to order food combined with that entrepreneurial ingenuity makes Wingstop&apos;s future growth just as exciting.
