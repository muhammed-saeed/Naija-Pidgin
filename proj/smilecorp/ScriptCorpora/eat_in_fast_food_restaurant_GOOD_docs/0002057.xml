Are isolated ground outlets necessary
 Are isolated ground outlets necessary to achieve clean power to our order taking and processing equipment in a fast food restaurant. We are using a 3kva dbl conversion ups conditioner and some inspectors want GFCI outlets throughout the store. Is there such thing as an isolated ground GFCI outlet?

 Junior Member Join Date Jan 2008 Posts 15 Could you give me a little info on why you feel this way.
We&apos;ve required it for years or their warranty is void.
We are leary to change that unless we have some good verifyable reasons. 01-09-08  04:57 PM #4 ryan_618

 Senior Member Join Date Nov 2005 Location Canterbury, New Zealand Posts 1,877 For IT systems, IG is not appropriate; if somehow an IG outlet makes IT work better then the real problem is the normal ground is busted.

The least bad approach is to use simplified P-A-N-I grounding (search this forum for it).

Breifly, put all your IT outlets marked and connected to one end of the ground bar, and all those horrible unclean kitcheny stuff on the other end of the ground bar, and have the neutral bond and GEC in the middle. If the panel isn&apos;t the service entrance then bring two greens in from the SE to the panel (again from either side of the neutral biond and GEC connection), and use two separate ground bars, one clean, one dirty.

If you are using a UPS, which I think you are, then adopt the same approach for the grounding of the UPS fed outlets. Bring a clean green to a small panel by the UPS thats just for the IT sockets, and feed it&apos;s ground bar from the clean green. 01-09-08  05:14 PM #7 roger

No, in fact it is not possible for IGR to remove or reduce any type of common-mode noise, there are no active or passive components to do that. The only things that can remove common-mode noise is separately derived systems like transformers and dual conversion UPS. 01-10-08  01:35 PM #9 Dominic Ramirez

LCDs, thermal printers, electronic switchboards, keyboards, PCs so probably 20 or 30. It varies from system to system. 01-10-08  01:51 PM #10 roger

I guess my question is, why is sensitive electronic equipment still built this way?
