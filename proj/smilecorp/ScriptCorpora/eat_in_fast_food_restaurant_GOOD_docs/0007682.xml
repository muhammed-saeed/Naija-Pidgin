For Real: BK’s Chef Choice and Topper Burgers
 I am not sure what exactly caught my attention or made me even want to try eating these burgers, but I guess I am always looking for some laughs and a good story to tell about a fast food restaurant that’s giving their college try on making“Chef’s Choice”burgers. Those words next to“BK”are funny enough on their own. Seriously BK? It’s like McDonald’s making juicy Lucy’s at a fast-food pace! Must say that this was quite the experience for me when I went looking for these bad boys.

  

Now, I really wasn’t planning on going during there busiest time-hell, it was just a coincidence. I knew that the drive-thru window was going to be tied up so I decided to head inside to order at the counter. Upon entering, there wasn’t a cashier at the register. Simply put, they had their a$$es lit up thanks to the drive-thru (which is exactly why I didn’t go through it). I approached the counter and stood there and waited, patiently mind you, for someone to come take my order, knowing that they were short-staffed and were all in a hurry to put out their food to waiting customers.

It may have taken a few minutes for someone to finally come up and take my order, but the process of ordering was easy: one BK Chef’s Choice burger, and also, a BK Topper Deluxe (which is basically their version of a Big Mac, but watered down. Something I had not also planned on trying). No fries and about nine dollars later, I began my wait.

Like I just mentioned, they were busy. Like, busy. The screen that was keeping track of their ticket times were a few shades of red, indicating that they were behind. I did this all on purpose. Why? To test to see how well they handle customers who are not as patient as I, and to see if their quality of their service and product would suffer from such circumstances.

The clock was winning this battle. I waited patiently and kept my cool, knowing from past experience how it is to be understaffed and seriously in the weeds. Slowing ticking to six on the nose, my order took approximately fifteen minutes. Which seems a bit unheard of in the fast -food industry. Without getting too flustered like the guy before me, which by the way, only ordered one frickin’sandwich and complained because he was in such a hurry to leave. Anyway, my order finally came up and I noticed that my cashier had placed fries in the bag and handed me a glass.“Oh I didn’t order fries”, I said without too much excitement in my voice, knowing this was because I didn’t cause a scene. She said it was because I was waiting a while and I told her that it’s no big deal-that I’ve been in her place before, staring into eyes of a fed up , impatient SOB.
I grabbed my bag and off I went to give my burgers a taste test. I threw the cup away, but I wanted the fries damn it.

 

The Deluxe was packaged in the traditional BK garb: their wax paper with the stupid drawings and chalk markings. The Chef’s Choice came in a clam shell, which is something that I haven’t seen their burgers come in before (it’s been a while).

 

 The Deluxe BK Topper

 Let’s get real here. A lot of the fast-food we purchase, almost never looks like their ad counterpart. You’ve got your basics here. The lettuce, the bigger beef patty, American cheese, a thick slice of white onion, pickles and their 1000 island sauce. To be frank, this tasted like any other BK burger, minus the fact that there is more meat. Is it worth the $1.99? The sauce wasn’t on par with McDonald’s. I’d rather get the BK Stacker. Like stated before, it’s a watered down version of the Mac.

 

 The Chef’s Choice 
 
 Here is what is stated on BK’s website about there Chef’s Choice burger:“A flame-broiled 5.5 oz burger patty, made with USDA certified ground chuck seasoned with salt and pepper, a thick slice American cheese, Naturally-smoked thick cut bacon, Fresh cut romaine lettuce, red onions and ripe tomatoes, our original grill sauce on an artisan bun . . .”These do taste a lot different then their usual flame-broiled taste. These legitimately taste like an actual burger, not beefed (no pun intended) up with soy and other BS. The lettuce sure looked fresh, but iceberg lettuce on burgers is not my cup of tea. Ripe tomatoes? No. Those I pushed off to the side. Everything else was kept on. The bacon looked crisp and the cheese was completely melted and even centered on the damn patty! It started to get weird after a few bites in. I had a hard time trying to figure out their“grill sauce”, but I know it seemed to taste too artificial for my taste buds.

Overall, were their burgers worth their price? Maybe. I’m sure the regular customers will/do love the pricing on these. When I first looked at the sign for the Chef’s Choice burger, it reminded me a lot of Smashburger’s signature. In the struggle between keeping customers happy with reasonable prices and putting out quality grub is no easy feat. I don’t think there will ever be that perfect balance at such a place as this.

I had a blast doing this. Not only because it allowed me to really write out everything I experienced, but it allowed me to take some snazzy pics of mediocre burgers. It’s all apart of the growing process for my blog. Posted by Sansuley at 9:00 AM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: I Eat

As I am a little hungry at the moment, the burgers look good to me.
I guess I think America&apos;s fast food is pretty good tasting. I don&apos;t think we all want a chef star meal all the time. Plus they are convenient and fun!
