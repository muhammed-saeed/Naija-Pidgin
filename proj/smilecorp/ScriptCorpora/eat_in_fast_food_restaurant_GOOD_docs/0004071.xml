 Sam&apos;s Original Restaurant Small Town Treasure 
by Audrey Whatley Payne , Arkansas
 ( 8 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - Sam&apos;s is one of those places unique to small town America. Family owned since it opened, the place has moved all over town and the crowds have followed. It&apos;s a tradition, every Sunday you go to church and after church you go to Sam&apos;s, and if your not there by 11:45 on Sunday morning you can expect a pretty good wait. That&apos;s ok it gives you a chance to visit the gift shop. You have two choices at Sam&apos;s the menu or the daily changing buffet, both are good. As far as buffets go, this one ranks right up there with the best of them. There are the staples of mashed potatoes, gravy, chicken fried steak and BBQ. Then there are the daily treats such as chicken and dumplings, fried catfish and some of the best chicken spaghetti I have ever tasted. Can&apos;t go wrong off of the menu either, good truck stop hamburgers, better steak than I have found at some steak houses and even liver and onions if that suites your fancy. I have been all over the country and met people from all over the world and I am always amazed to hear that if they have been to Texas and traveled I45 they never miss a chance to go to Sam&apos;s.

 Feast On This I have no idea what the negative posters are talking about. 
by Michelin Jr. ( 2 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - $7.99 for an all you can eat buffet is a fantastic deal. I ate here today and all of the food was above average to really good. The hot and sour soup was excellent as was the teriyaki chicken. The salad bar alone is worth the price of admission for all you can eat. Some of the other items weren&apos;t spectacular but certainly edible and a better bargain than any chain restaurant in town. I will be sorely disappointed if people don&apos;t support this place enough to keep them in business and we end up with nothing but chain restaurants that charge more for frozen microwaved food.

 Lake House Grill Don&apos;t Bother 
by Leslie , Dallas/Fort Worth
 ( 6 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - Lunch here today was not very enjoyable. Service was better than the 2 previous times I&apos;ve been, however the food is severely lacking now. The sandwiches were much smaller and dry. A friend ordered the black and blue salad and when she could not find the blue cheese and asked about it, the waitress came back and said they were out of blue cheese - really? - Then why didn&apos;t she come back to begin with and report that and ask if the customer would like to order something different? She certainly would have. The chicken wings and fried mushrooms were swimming in grease. Overall? We won&apos;t be back...

 Pasta Bella Restaurant Simply Delicious 
by Denjuami ( 1 review )
 July 11, 2012 My husband and I just had dinner there and it was delicious! The bread and dipping sauce were very tasty and our salads were out very quickly. I ordered their regular manicotti and I have to say it is the best manicotti I&apos;ve had. The sauce was very sweet and decadent. My husband ordered the ravioli&quot;Pasta Bella style&quot;and it was also delicious. Their pesto sauce is the best we&apos;ve had. The service was also great! All around this is a fantastic restaurant and would love to go back to eat there.

 Colima&apos;s Mexican Food Best Mexican Food in Texarkana 
by Dactul , Arkansas
 ( 4 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - Colima&apos;s serves California-style Mexican food, IMO. Those that don&apos;t like Tex-Mex or prefer only&quot;authentic&quot;Mexican food should enjoy this place. The prices are extremely reasonable for the mountains of food you receive. My husband and I eat breakfast there quite often so I can get the chilaquiles, which is excellent. When we eat lunch or dinner there, I like to get the shredded beef tacos on soft corn tortillas; my husband gets the carnitas. Their chili sauce and salsa verde are awesome. The food is prepared like it would be at someone&apos;s house; the meat is slow-cooked and tender, and everything is super fresh. They serve horchata, which is a rarity in NE Texas. They also have a drive-thru that makes ordering really convenient when you&apos;re in a rush. You probably won&apos;t be impressed by the interior; it&apos;s just a quaint place, but, man, the food coming out of that place is AMAZING!

 Tamolly&apos;s Mexican Restaurant Great Weekday Specials - Easy on the wallet. 
by Dactul , Arkansas
 ( 4 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - The food at Tamolly&apos;s is very good; I generally get the enchiladas, and I find their salsa to be very fresh, just about the best in town. It&apos;s Tex-Mex so you can get chili con carne on everything (yah)! Their service is WAY faster than any other dine-in restaurant in town, and I have ALWAYS had wonderful experiences with the servers. I&apos;ve noticed that a lot of their employees have been there since they opened back in the late 90&apos;s (I think), so I&apos;m thinking they must be a decent employer as well, since most other restaurants have high turnovers. The prices are very reasonable, and if you catch one of the weekday specials, a family of 3 can get out of there under $20 (possibly not including the tip, of course)...nothing short of a miracle these days. The only con is that they don&apos;t serve margaritas, but then again, sometimes it&apos;s nice to go to a restaurant with your child and not have loud, drunken idiots encircling you. If you&apos;re one of those foodie snobs that thinks every Mexican joint should be 100% authentic then this isn&apos;t your kinda place... But, if you like Tex-Mex and a decent meal at a decent price with fast service this is your place.

 Reunion on the Square mobile review 
by Alicia ( 10 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - Not as good the second time as the first. This place needs to train their wait staff better and be consistent with food coming out right every time. The Cobb salad isn&apos;t bad but I&apos;ve had better and i make better broccoli cheese soup than they do, it was bland. A full bar would be nice too. It has potential but I&apos;m afraid the owners really don&apos;t know much about the food business!

 Cow Camp Steakhouse mobile review 
by Alicia ( 10 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - I&apos;d rather go to Saltgrass where they don&apos;t charge you extra if you split an entree w someone. That should be my choice to do that. Not much food for the price you pay either. The food isn&apos;t bad but way too pricey for what you get. I live right down the street and still not worth it to eat there.

 Sam&apos;s Restaurant mobile review 
by Prairie Kerri ( 1 review )
 July 11, 2012 - I can&apos;t say enough great things about this restaurant. First, the food is truly homemade on the buffet and was fantastic! Second, the service was the best I&apos;ve ever experienced (and I am picky when it comes to service). On another note, other reviewers have said it was pricey...I disagree. $10.99 for all you can eat buffet and homemade pie and cake included in that price! Children 12 and under have a discounted price and 2 years and younger eat free....

 Marco&apos;s Pizza Good Pizza, Poor Service 
by pwizard ( 1 review )
 July 11, 2012 - I&apos;ve ordered three times from this restaurant and each time there was some kind of problem with my order. The first time the ovens were not working. The second time they were out of the topping I ordered. The third time they failed to include part of my order which I didn&apos;t realize until I got back home. I contacted the restaurant to give them feedback and they told me&quot;too bad, this isn&apos;t a perfect world&quot;. I would steer clear of this restaurant as they clearly do not put the needs of the customer first.

 Glow mobile review 
by J. Card ( 4 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 We had shrimp and halibut for entrees and both were tasty and portions just right. For starters we had tomatoes and eggplant. Tomatoes were okay but the eggplant was dry. The server was pleasant but we had to ask for water, bread, drinks. She had on jeans, not very professional for the price of the meals. We won&apos;t go back. It was too expensive for what we received--both the service and the food

 Icon Restaurant&amp;Bar Disappointing 
by Randy Pohler ( 1 review )
 July 10, 2012 - Food is mediocre and management is less than professional. Wait Staff is not motivated and the dining experience is disappointing. The owner is attempting to raise the bar however management is incapable of meeting the needed goals to make this a reality. Not worth the drive or the risk of&quot;running the DPS gauntlet&quot;for those wishing to enjoy a nice bottle of wine with a pleasant dining experience.

 July 10, 2012 - If you love FRESH authentic Mexican Food, this is a great place to stop. Stopped on my way back from Shreveport and look forward to the next time I have an excuse to be within 100 miles of this place. It is not often that you eat a meal that you actually want to go hug the cook. Loved it!!

 Hum Dinger Drive In BEST Onion Rings EVER!

 July 10, 2012 - We ate at the Humdinger for lunch on Sunday afternoon and ordered the Catfish sandwiches. They were really good, and I enjoyed my okra too. My hubby ordered the rings instead of okra or fries and WOW! I wish I&apos;d gotten them too; but lucky me, he shared...they are so awesome I really wish I had their recipe. You can bite into them and the onion won&apos;t slip out of the batter and whack you in the chin. Totally wonderful!!!

 Coney Island Cafe Great Value, Service,&amp;Food 
by Billy Howard ( 2 reviews )
 July 10, 2012 - Buttermilk pie is perfect combination of sweetness with crust. Mushy, as most pie is, yet if you are a pie lover, it is a must have. Chili is like the old fashioned chili dog chili and they use American cheese. The dogs were yummy (mine - minus cheese) Not sure who their supplier is for Mustard but excellent. (This is T posting for William Earl, btw:)

 Library Fried Shrimp by betsyross ( 1 review )
 July 10, 2012 - Bar is in front and the whole place smells. we got there early and ordered received a preplated bagged unwashed salad. then we got the appetizer we ordered. scallops mini marshmallow size and cooked to the texture of rubber. Since the appetizer was late they held out dinner till we were through so it was barely warm. I got shrimp touted as the best in town. What I got was frozen fried coconut shrimp way over breaded and under cooked. yuck!! The grease was old and tasted like something I had never tasted before and you could squeeze it out of the shrimp. The cocktail sauce was sweet and awful.. Potato would have been good except it was barely warm. Our little server was great and the staff is very friendly. Was 20.00 for one plus drinks of course. maybe i should have ordered steak. Did not expect frozen shrimp. Really disappointed. If you drink first you might not notice the food. ;0(

 July 09, 2012 We happened upon this Steakhouse by chance last night as it sits in the middle of nowhere. Thank Goodness we did because the food is just AWESOME!!!! They have a great selection on the menu, the waiter was friendly and very attentive. Meals were prepared quickly and were some of the best we&apos;ve had anywhere. If you are passing through, this is a MUST. I definitely recommend you dropping in and having a burger, steak, or philly style sandwich. Oh and don&apos;t forget they have the BEST fries of all time. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!

 Sals&amp;Sams ...And I Keep Going Back 
by Trusted Tongue ( 31 reviews )
 July 09, 2012 - Well I guess I can go ahead and add Sal&apos;s&amp;Sam&apos;s to my personal Best of Lufkin list. They recently added some menu items that look excellent, now I just have to deal with the inner turmoil of choosing one of the new offerings over my favorite spicy gyro. Perhaps I can order both and just pig out. New to the menu is a California Caprese Sandwich which I hear is a big hit and some wonderful sounding salads. I just can&apos;t tell you how nice it is to have a non-chain place that serves such great food so consistently. The menu isn&apos;t wildly out of the box or anything like that, but very unique for Lufkin. You have to try it. There is definitely something or many things here that you will like.

 La Four&apos;s Restaurant Let&apos;s do set the record straight 
by mha1655 ( 1 review )
 July 09, 2012 La Four&apos;s is an independently owned and family operated local restaurant with a solid reputation that dates back more than a quarter century. They are really good at what they do and they&apos;ve been doing it for a very long time. Their record speaks for itself. I would strongly suggest you give them a try. Great people, great food. I should know. My name is Mark and I&apos;m the guy that owns the restaurant right next to them. I assure you there is no riff! We have both peacefully co-existed as neighbors since 1988. I have tremendous respect for them, their operation and how they have treated me. I cannot say the same for the previous occupants of that location. urbanspoon called me and not being overly familiar with their website, I logged on to cruise around and take a look. Some of the prior comments surprised me. I hope my neighbors don&apos;t object to me posting on their turf, but I felt the need to put this out there. The LaFour&apos;s are great people and great operators. I&apos;d like to think they feel the same way about me.

 Padrino&apos;s Brick Oven Pizza AMAZING 
by Rebecca Kahayas ( 1 review )
 July 09, 2012 - If I could only eat one more meal in my lifetime, I&apos;d give my last dollar for Padrino&apos;s. The pizza alone is heaven in your mouth and you just cant get enough of it. The restaurant has prospered and is only getting greater by the day. The affordable prices and quality of food are no match for any other expensive Italian restaurants. My favorite dishes are the Salmon Salad and Mo&apos;s Chicken and I highly recommend them, but overall...every item on the menu has a signature flavor that you will not forget and be happy to swing back in. Whether it be on your way from a road trip, or if you live in the area, stop by and you will be happy you did!

 Rudy Roos Seafood Seafood Sampler by Wax ( 1 review )
 July 09, 2012 During the 4th of July week-we a family of 16 were looking for some good seafood restaurants in the Freeport area. I found Rudy&apos;s by searching the internet. When we got there 1/2 the family stopped at the door once they looked inside. I guess since it was not a 4 star to 5 star restaurant- they got nervous. After talking to a customer about Rudy&apos;s food-they decided to try it. Well- the service was great-very friendly and the food was awesome. They made us feel right at home. I had the seafood sampler which was great.... If there was anything negative about Rudy&apos;s would be the temp inside-it was a little stuffy. But Rudy&apos;s Roos has open the eyes to some of my family members- some of the best eating spots are not always the restaurants with big signs and fancy table settings. Thanks for taking care of us Rudy Roo&apos;s

 Shumardii Hits and Misses 
by Pat Coppini ( 6 reviews )
 July 08, 2012 We have eaten at Shumardii&apos;s multiple times and have had unpredictable ups and downs. The fried mushroom appetizer has always been excellent, while other fried foods have been very inconsistent. Last Friday night&apos;s chicken fried chicken was so overcooked that the crust was dark brown and hard-crunchy. There was a pooled brownish substance on the plate which the waitress said was&quot;probably grease.&quot;She then asked me what it tasted like! (I explained that I did not plan to sample it.) Saturday night we returned with friends who ordered the chicken tenders and found them to be fried to perfection. The kitchen seems to excel with desserts. The chocolate lava cake is the best I have tasted in the greater DFW area. There is a dessert of the day that has varied from bread pudding (with an outstanding whiskey sauce) to banana cream pie, and each offering has been superior. Service has fluctuated as much as the quality of the food, and the kitchen is often out of some items. If you catch them on a good night, the experience can be quite pleasant.

 July 08, 2012 - Save your money. Menu lists&quot;teaser&quot;items that cannot be ordered. They actually laugh at you and think it is funny if you try to order one. They insist they are simply doing what corporate mandates. Too bad corporate does not mandate manners and good food.
