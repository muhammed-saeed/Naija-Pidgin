 Employer Lunch and Break Law Requirements in Minnesota 
 August 2nd, 2006 Posted by Sarah 
Recently, I’ve been researching state lunch and break laws. Minnesota is one of 19 states with specific state regulations regarding employee meals and breaks.

Minnesota state law stipulates that “sufficient time” to eat a meal must be provided to all employees who work for eight hours or more consecutively. This meal break may generally be unpaid if it is at least 30 minutes long, but only if the employee is completely relieved of his or her duties. If the worker must do any job duties during the meal break, it would not qualify as an unpaid meal break.

I also found it interesting that Minnesota law mandates paid rest breaks for all employees. Within each consecutive four hours of work, an employee must be given sufficient time to use the rest room.

Finally, there are some interesting work hour issues found in federal law related to sleep time, waiting time, and travel time that Minnesotans may be interested in. Whether or not waiting time needs to be considered paid work hours depends on the situation. If an employee is allowed to do something of his or her choosing while waiting for another task to be finished or while waiting at the workplace for his or her services to be called upon, it is generally considered work time. On the other hand, if an employee is waiting to be called upon, but has great freedom to do what he or she wishes while on call (and has plenty of time to respond to the call), it is not generally considered paid work time.

When it comes to sleeping time, an employee required to be on duty less than 24 hours is considered to be “working” even if he or she is permitted to sleep during some of those hours when not busy. If an employee is on duty more than 24 hours, a sleeping period of no more than eight hours may be deducted from work hours. However, this can only be done if sleeping quarters are provided and at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep may be achieved by the employee.

Then there is the issue of travel time. The general rule of thumb is that time spent in the normal day’s commute to and from work is not considered paid working time. However, if an employee is traveling in the course of a days work, it must be considered paid work time.

A thorough presentation of state and federal laws related to lunches and breaks may be found on the Minnesota Complete Labor Law Poster . This poster also presents required notices for all areas of both state and federal labor laws.

My employer does not abide in the break laws.in st.paul minnesota
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Roger! Minnesota law requires that employees be given“sufficient time to eat a meal”when working a shift of 8 hours or more. Also, the law requires that employees be given a paid break to use the restroom in the morning and afternoon.
If your employer is breaking this law, we suggest that you report them to the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry at http://www.doli.state.mn.us/ . HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

is an employer obligated by law to provide an adequate break room?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Sam! No, there is no requirement under Minnesota law for the employer to provide a break room. That’s because it would be impossible in many work situations, including convienance stores and construction sites. HTH, and thanks for reading the blog!~ Amelia

What if a Minnesota employer doesn’t offer any breaks through a 4 to 5 hour shift, or an 8 hour or more shift, but does offer a 30 min unpaid lunch break for an 8 hour or more shift?

Employees are allowed to use the bathroom basically as needed however.
There is no break area. Employees are required to stand for all shifts.

Are they skirting the break law here because they do allow bathroom use if asked, but no actual“break”time ???
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Karen! Yes, this is a grey area. As noted in the article above, Minnesota employees are entitled to a meal break of 20 minutes or more when working an 8-hour shift. Employees working shorter shifts need not be given meal breaks.
It is perfectly acceptable to have the employees stand throughout the shift, except the meal break–in fact, many occupations demand it. The law does not require formal break times for restroom breaks—only that the employees be given sufficient time to use the nearest restroom once every four hours. The employer in this case would probably argue that the employees are given that time, but choose not to take advantage of it. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

my boss wont let me leave on my 30 min lunch break. They won’t let me go and smoke or leave to eat lunch elsewhere. If I am not being paid for lunch can the make me stay and wait in the building?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Trapper! Unfortunately, yes, this is entirely lawful in Minnesota. In most states, the employer can require that an employee remain on the premises, even a non-smoking premises, during an unpaid lunch break. If you are being required to work during your lunch break, then you should be paid for it. But simply being on the property does not constitute work. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hi…I understand that an employer has to give the employee a 30 minute lunch break for 8 hours work. My question is, does MN law state that an
employee has to take that 30 minute break? Sometimes I just don’t want to
take a break….

Thanks!
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Alice! The problem is that in Minnesota, if you do not take a break, your employer is breaking the law.
Several states have systems in place where an employee can decline a statutory meal break. Minnesota does not. The only way for the Minnesota employer to stay in compliance with the law is to require you to take the break.
Many employers also require that workers take unpaid meal breaks to save payroll dollars. This is perfectly legal in any state. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

My company allows 1/2 hour unpaid for lunch and 2–15 minute breaks for 8 hrs, they have recently changed everyone’s schedule and use to give an additional 10 min break for over 8 hrs, now they have taken that away. What is the break and rest laws for working a mandatory 10 hour day. (1/2 hour lunch 9.5 hrs work time)?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Debbie! Minnesota law requires that employees on a shift of 8 hours or longer receive an unpaid meal break long enough to eat a meal. It also requires that they be permitted a break long enough to use the nearest restroom during every 4 consecutive hours of work. It sounds like your employer is complying with those requirements. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

I currently work a 12 hour day we are given 3 15min breaks threw out the day. But no Half hour break for launch. I have seen employees get written up for taking a 20 min break to eat their lunch and what not. What are exactily the laws on breaking time? I read the article above and from my understanding we should be getting at least a 30 min. lunch break time unpaided. Were currently not getting this. How would one handle this cause there are many employees fearfull of getting fired over this break issue.

Thanks for your time,

Shane
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Shane! Under Minnesota law, an employee who works a shift of 8 consecutive hours or more must be given sufficient time to eat a meal during the shift. If the time allowed is less than 20 minutes, it must be paid. (Employees can negotiate a different arrangement under a union contract.) Apparently the employer is counting the three 15-minute breaks as one or more meal periods. You can file a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry, but as long as you are being paid for the three breaks, the employer is probably in compliance. Theoretically, at least, an employer cannot lawfully take action against an employee for filing a complaint. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hi Amelia,
I work at a home for adults with disabilities. Our boss recentally told everyone that no one is allowed to use their cell phones. I completely understand her wanting staff to be attentive to the consumers but we also do not get breaks during an eight hour shift. Are we in trouble for using our cell phones while in the bathroom on an informal“break?”or is the bathroom break only for using the bathroom.

Thanks, jenny
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Jenny! Thanks for an interesting post! Yes, the employer can forbid cell phone usage in the workplace, and can discipline or terminate any employee who violates this policy. This includes using the cell phone in the bathroom—even during a bathroom break. (Sorry, we had to say that.) The employer gets to set the rules in the workplace, and in this case the employer has set a rule of“no cell phone usage.”OSHA worker safety regulations and Minnesota law protect the employee’s right to use the bathroom—but there is no right to use the bathroom to make calls on a cell phone. To answer your question, under OSHA regulations and Minnesota law, the bathroom break is only to use the bathroom.
We will compare this to another activity frequently forbidden by employers—smoking. Employees have no right to smoke in the bathroom, if smoking is forbidden in the workplace. So when the employer says no cell phone usage in the workplace…that means no cell phone usage, even in the bathroom. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia
 
Posted by: Jenny 

Amelia,

You have been very helpful with your answer. I chuckled at my question because I do think literally using the phone during a bathroom break would be inappropriate. But, in order to understand the Bathroom Break law, I had to ask such a strange question. I will share this information with my co-workers.
Unfortunately several of us were wrong but a new understanding will relieve conflicts between employer and employees so, there IS something to gain.

Thank you so much for your time!
-Jenny
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi again Jenny! Your question also made me chuckle—partly because some people DO talk on their cell phones during bathroom breaks! I’m sure you’ve seen that too, even though it’s probably inappropriate.
Your employer certainly could give you a 10-minute break twice per day, during which cell phone calls were permitted. It may be worth asking, even though there is no law that the employer must grant such breaks. Glad to know that I could help. If you have more questions, feel free to post them!~ Amelia

Hello from Minnesota. My employees have brought up an interesting question recently. Bear with me. Some employees are taking advantage of the unsupervised nature of my restaurant to take frequent smoke breaks every day. The other employees who dont smoke have complained that they have to do more work to make up for the smokers. I announced that anyone who wants to smoke has to punch out for their smoke breaks. The smokers came back at me asking how many hours they have to work to get a paid break. What are the laws that cover this? Am I required to give any paid breaks for employees working 6 hours? 8 hours?

Thanks.
-Geno
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Chef Geno! Frequent smoke breaks are a problem that many employers face. You are right to be concerned. Some recent studies show that the average smoker takes breaks totaling more than 60 hours per year. That’s the equivalent of paying the average smoker for an extra week and a half, when the smoker is not working. Naturally, non-smokers resent working while their coworkers are playing.

Unfortunately, when there is little supervision, you may always have employees who take advantage of their coworkers by doing little work.

Minnesota law requires that an employer give an employee who works 8 or more hours an unpaid meal break. We assume that you are complying with that law. Like most states, Minnesota has no law that requires an employer to give employees rest breaks. (In fact, 31 states don’t even require a meal break.) The only rest break law in Minnesota requires that an employee be given sufficient paid time during each consecutive 4-hour work segment to use the nearest restroom. So legally, you do not have to give smokers any breaks at all. (You could even make the entire workplace non-smoking if you liked, and fire anyone caught smoking.)

However, be aware that your current policy of having smokers clock out for breaks may well be illegal under federal law. The federal FLSA or Fair Labor Standards Act does not require that an employer give any breaks to employees. However, if the employer chooses to give short rest breaks, the FLSA requires that the employer pay workers for any rest breaks that are less than 20 minutes long. So if an employee clocks out for a 7-minute smoke break, and you do not pay them for that time, you are in violation of the federal minimum wage law. The federal law applies to any employer with revenue over $500,000 per year, and to employees who engage in interstate commerce.

To be fair, our suggestion is that you permit each employee–smokers and non-smokers alike—to take one 10- to 15- minute paid break for each 4 hour work segment. (Even though Minnesota law does not require you to do so.) An employee who works 6 hours would receive one break. An employee who works 8 or more hours would receive an unpaid meal break, plus two paid rest breaks. Smokers can smoke on thier break, and non-smokers can rest, make personal phone calls, read, or relax. (Studies have shown that employees who receive such paid breaks are actually more productive than employees who do not receive any breaks.) This will allow the smokers to satisfy their nicotine cravings, while not taking advantage of their coworkers. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Amelia could you please post the link for the actual Minnesota break laws?

Also you keep saying an 8 hr shift what if i am only working 6 hr or 7.5hr shifts??
do I have to take a lunch break? I don’t want to and if i do eat it takes me 5 mins.

also is it Minnesota state law that I get 2, 15min paid breaks??? and what are the shift minimum hrs to receive these 2 breaks , is it a 4hr min work shift???
 
Posted by: greg 

One other thing, i am against taking a lunch break here because my work place can not facilitate the kind of area or cooking appliances needed for my meal prep. I am on a special diet for health reasons and cant just eat fast food or microwavable frozen food. We don’t even have a real break room. just a tiny area in back where we punch in/out store stuff. have a microwave and fridge and toilet. Is there a law about this???
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi greg! The Minnesota links are below. The important thing to remember is that the break law is the minimum standard the employer must follow. However, the employer can establish company break policies that require more or longer breaks, and discipline or terminate any employee who does not take the required breaks.

The law states that a Minnesota employees who works a shift of 8 hours or more must be given“sufficient time to eat a meal.”That means an employer is not legally required to give a meal break to any employee who works a shorter shift—but again, the employer can legally require it and terminate any employee who refuses.

Under federal law, if the employee takes a break of less than 20 minutes, it must be paid. For this reason, many employers require that employees take meal breaks that are longer than 20 minutes—regardless of how quickly the employee eats.

There is no Minnesota law that employees are entitled to any short rest breaks of 10 or 15 minutes during the day. The Minnesota break law simply requires that the employee be given sufficient time to use the nearest restroom, at the mid-point of each 4-hour work segment. There is no requirement that the employee be permitted to eat, drink, make a phone call or smoke during this time, even if these activities are conducted in the bathroom. The break is strictly to use the toilet. Again, the employer can grant such breaks if they wish, but employees must be paid for breaks shorter than 20 minutes under federal law. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hi again greg! Sorry, we really wish we could help but the bottom line is, you don’t have to eat, but you do have to clock out for the meal break if the employer requires it. You can be terminated for not doing so.

There is no Minnesota law that an employer must provide a full kitchen for employees to cook meals, or even a break area. Truck drivers can be required to eat in thier truck, and construction workers can be required to eat on the job site. So if your employer provides a microwave and refrigerator in the break area, that is much more than many employees get. Our suggestion is that you prepare your meals at home, and use the microwave to reheat them at work. The other options would be to bring in food that can be eaten cold, or as we said, not to eat at work but to take the required break. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Being employed as a store manager, I come in at 8am to do daily paperwork prior to opening at 9am. (Store hours are 9-5)
My pay stub says I am getting paid for 40 hours a week.
We are not allowed to lock the store up during the time we should be taking our lunch break. I must eat my lunch at my desk, putting my lunch aside when customers come in or I get calls.
I have never had a morning break or afternoon break in the three years I have worked there. (I must mention that I am the only employee in the store)
My question is….
Does Minnesota law require my employer to let us take breaks or compensate us for the NO break times even though I am salaried?)
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Jim! It sounds like the employer is abiding by the break laws, but may be in violation of the overtime law. The Minnesota break law requires that an employee be given a) enough time during each 4-hour work segment to use the nearest restroom and b) enough time during an 8-hour shift to eat a meal. (Different rules apply if the employee is working under a union contract.)

Allowing you to eat your lunch at your desk while working complies with the Minnesota meal break law. If the employer required you to clock out for this 20 or 30 minutes, but take incoming calls or wait on customers while clocked out, that would be a violation of the wage and hour law. However, it appears that the employer does not require you to clock out during this meal break—you are allowed to eat a meal while on the clock. That is in compliance with the state law. As long as the meal break is paid, there is no requirement that it be uninterrupted.

The rest break law requires that you be allowed to use the nearest restroom, period. It does not require that you be permitted to smoke, make a personal phone call, eat or drink—only that you be allowed to use the toilet. Presumably you are being allowed to use the toilet when nature calls, at least once every 4 hours.

So our best opinion is that this employer is in compliance with the Minnesota meal and rest break laws. (Even if the employer were in violation of the break laws, Minnesota does not require additional time paid to the employee as compensation—the employer can be fined by the state, but the money does not go to the employees.)

However, overtime may be another matter. Even though your job title is manager, it does not appear that you meet either the federal or Minnesota requirements for an exempt employee. For one thing, you apparently do not supervise any other employees, nor are your job responsibilities primarily administrative. Therefore, you would be a non-exempt employee, entitled to payment for all hours worked, and to overtime. If you work 45 hours, as a non-exempt employee you should be paid for 45 hours—not 40 hours.

If the employer is covered by Minnesota law, you would be entitled to overtime after working 48 hours in the payroll week. If the employer is covered by federal law (or if you are engaged in interstate commerce, like accepting credit card payments or using the Internet at work) you are entitled to overtime when you work more than 40 hours in the payroll week. If you think you are not an exempt employee, you should file a wage complaint with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry, or with the U.S. Department of Labor. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Is an employee allowed to decline a paid break that is given during a 4-6 hour shift? Especially if the employee is all done working and then the employer makes them stay punched in and on the premises for an additional 20 minutes just to take a break?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Jasmine! This is a matter of company policy, rather than state law. Your employer can require that you take a meal break and discipline or terminate any employee who does not. The employer is being generous by paying you for the break. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia
 
Posted by: Jasmine 

But from what it looks like the employer is not required to give me a MEAL break unless I work for more than 8 hours. If I only work a 5 hour shift than why am I REQUIRED to take a 20 min paid break? We have adequate access to the bathroom and are allowed to use the facilities when needed. From what I can tell in the blogs it doesn’t seem as though any of that is required by law. I understand that it may be company policy though and that is ultimately what I am trying to determine. I can’t do much to challenge the law, but I can challenge company policy in an effort to change it. Thank you.
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi again Jasmine! There are two separate issues here: state law and company policy.

You are correct—the state law requires a meal break for employees who work 8 hours. That is the minimum standard that the employer must follow, not the maximum standard that the employer can impose. In this case company policy requires a meal break for employees who work a 5 or 6 hour shift.

We disagree with your assertion that you can change company policy. The employer would have to change the policy for everyone. In most cases, this would mean that an employee who works 5 or 6 hours would never be entitled to a meal break. Some of your coworkers are likely to have a problem with that.

You can certainly raise this issue tactfully with the employer. However, if you are not careful, the only change will be that you are unemployed, rather than employed. The employer could also eliminate the meal break and simply require that you work that time. The employer is being extremely generous by paying you for this time. Our suggestion is that you just consider it part of the work day. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia
 
Posted by: Roger 

Hi Amelia,

My company does 4 day work weeks. All of us are exempt and are required to work 11hr days. We usually get a 1 hr break in between and can be taken in any format( 1hr or one 1/2 hr break and two 15 min break or three 20 mins breaks-you get the idea). I am confused if these breaks are paid or not. From what I am reading atleast 1/2 hr should be paid, which means that I am actually working 10.5 hrs/day ie 42 hrs a week. Help me understand! Thanks
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Roger! Just so you know, under the federal FLSA, hourly employees must be paid for any breaks that are shorter than 20 minutes. So if an hourly employee in your situation took a 30 minute break and two 15 minute breaks, he would be entitled to payment for the two 15 minute breaks. But if he took two 30 minute breaks, or one 60 minute break, he would not be entitled to payment for any of them.

It’s all irrelevant anyway, because you are not an hourly employee. You are an exempt employee. An exempt employee is entitled to his or her full salary for the week, whether the employee works 40 hours, 42 hours or 88 hours in the payroll week. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia
 
Posted by: Gator 

I am confused. I am not an attorney. I have a semi-professional, hourly job here in Minnesota. After working for a number of years under the policy of an optional, unpaid lunch break, I am suddenly being required by my employer to take time off for lunch every work day.
Minnesota Statute 177.254 MANDATORY MEAL BREAK.
Subdivision 1.Meal break.
An employer must permit each employee who is working for eight or more consecutive hours sufficient time to eat a meal.
It seems straight forward that“must permit”does NOT say“is required.”
How do you come up with the requirement that employees MUST take a lunch break?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Gator! In several states, the employee is permitted to waive the meal break by statute, as long as it is done in writing. Minnesota does not. The only way the employer can prove that the employee was permitted to take a meal break, is for the employee to take the meal break.

Even in a state with no meal break law, the employer can establish the policy that employees must clock out for a meal break. Any employee who refuses can be disciplined or terminated. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hi Amelia,
I am wondering what qualifies as a minimum shift? If I am scheduled to work 4hrs and then get sent home after only 1hr, how many hours is my employer obligated to pay me?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi soraya! Like most states, Minnesota does not have a law regarding the minimum shift. (A few states, such as Pennsylvania and California, do have such laws.) In Minnesota, if you are scheduled for 4 or 8 hours, the employer can send you home after 1 hour and only pay you for one hour. The employer cannot require that you hang around waiting for work without paying you, but as long as you are being sent home, this is legal. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

The co. I work for requires we clock out for a 30 min unpaid lunch, due to customer needs I often work thru my lunch this is authorized but the the person that does our payroll will change our time cards and deduct a lunch even if we dont take one. Is this allowed ?
I am also interupted many times by customers and management when I am clocked out for lunch, I am told thats just the way it is, I am still charged for the full 30 min. lunch.Is this allowed. I am a field service mechanic
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi JT! No, this is not legal. There are two separate issues here, the Minnesota break law and payment. As long as you have sufficient time to consume a meal at work, the employer is complying with the Minnesota break law.

However, both the Minnesota and federal minimum wage laws require that an employee be paid for all the time he or she works. Generally speaking, the meal break an be unpaid only when you are relieved of all duties and the break is uninterrupted. It sounds like this is not happening in your case. We will assume that you have tactfully discussed this with your supervisor and with payroll. You should file a wage complaint with the Minnesota department of Labor and Industry at http://www.dli.mn.gov/LS/FaqHours.asp . The employer owes you 30 minutes pay for every day in which you worked through lunch or your lunch was interrupted. They will research the employers records, and force the employer to pay if you are owed money. It is illegal for the employer to retaliate against an employee who files a wage complaint in good faith. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs! ~Amelia

Hi Amelia,

I have a sister who works at a fast food restaurant here in Minnesota, and she was telling me that for an 8 hour shift, she’s only allowed one 20 minute break for the entire day. They do, however, have easy access to the bathroom during any down time.

Is the restaurant breaking any laws by doing this? 20 minute break for a long 8 hour work day seems wrong.
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Jenny! No, this is entirely legal in Minnesota. State law only requires that employees be give sufficient time to eat a meal at some point during the shift. Twenty minutes is considered sufficent time to eat the meal. Minnesota law also requires that employees be permitted enough time to use the nearest bathroom at least once every 4 hours, and it appears the employer is complying with this. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia
 
Posted by: Confused 

Hi there from Minnesota. I currently work a 12 hour shift. We are only allowed a forty five minute paid break during our shift. Is this following the break law?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Confused! Yes, this is legal as long as you are also allowed to use the toilet when nature calls.

The Minnesota meal break law requires only that an employee be permitted“sufficient time to eat a meal”on a shift of 8 consecutive hours or more . This is usually interpreted as 20 minutes, and may be unpaid. There is nothing in Minnesota law that would require a longer meal break on a longer shift. The employer actually does not have to pay you for this meal break under the state law, nor do they have to give you a meal break longer than 20 minutes.

In addition, Minnesota law requires that an employee be permitted sufficient paid time to use the nearest toilet once during every 4-hour period. In fact, federal OSHA worker safety regulations require that employees be permitted to use the toilet“whenever nature calls.”Toilet or rest breaks shorter than 20 minutes must be paid under federal law.

Neither of these Minnesota laws apply if there is a collective bargaining agreement in place that specifies other break arrangements. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia
 
Posted by: KARI 

Hi, I was wondering if you can tell mu under Minnesota law how many hours you have to work to get a lunch break included in your pay. Currently it is work 10 hours and your lunch is included. They want to change it to 16 hours work before you get a paid lunch. Can you tell me if there is anything different or is ti up to the employer?

And my other question is, if you have your full 40 hours worked and you work an extra shift that is double time due to a holiday, should that be double-time-and-a-half, or something, since it is overtime for you as well?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi KARI! We are happy to answer your questions, although you might not like the answers.

If an employee is relieved of all duties during a meal period that is longer than 20 mintues, there is no Minnesota or federal law that the employee must be paid for the meal period. This is true, whether the employee has worked for 8 hours or 18 hours. The employer is never required by law to pay the employee for the lunch break.

Federal law requires that an employee who works more than 40 hours in the payroll week be paid 1.5 times the employee’s average rate for overtime. (MInnesota law requires time-and-a-half after 48 hours.) There is no law that requires double time or a higher rate than that. Because the employer was paying you double-time, they were already paying more than the law requires.

Both of these answers might be different if you were working under a union contract that addressed these issues. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

At my place of employment our boss told us today that we can no longer bring our own food or drink to work we have to eat what is served for dinner. I work in a shelter for juveniles. They also stated that if we want to bring our own food we have to eat it on the premise without being in the sight of the children but they don’t allow us anywhere private to eat on my shift. If we choose to take that route we have to take a 30 min unpaid break but we can’t leave the premises. We sometimes work 11 hour shifts and some people have allergies and prior health concerns not allowing them to go a shift without eating. Is this legal?

Hi Chris! These are less than ideal working conditions but generally speaking, this is legal. The employer has a valid concern here. It is probably creating problems with the juveniles for staff members to be eating burgers and Twinkies in front of them, while clients are dining on mystery meat. So there is a valid business reason for this policy.

Minnesota law requires that the employee be given time to eat a meal on the shift. The employer is doing that, and even providing you with a dinner. There is no requirement that employees go hungry. In fact, they are being encouraged to eat the dinner provided. Since you are required to eat with the clients, this meal break should be paid.

There is no requirement that Minnesota employees be allowed to leave the premises for a meal break, even an unpaid one. Nor is there a requirement that the employer provide staffing levels sufficient that you can eat your own food in a private location, or that you be allowed to choose the menu of the food served. (Think of a school cafeteria, where teachers on duty must eat with students. This is a similar situation.)

If an employee had a documented disability under the ADA definition, the employer would be required to make reasonable accommodations for that disability. For example, a diabetic employee might be required to eat about the same meal at about the same time each day, and to avoid starchy foods and sweets. In that case, the employer might have to make some adjustments to the menu or meal policy for this employee. However, that would not affect other employees. Most food allergies do not approach the ADA test for a disability—a condition that interferes with multiple basic life functions, such as walking, reading or using public transportation. However, an employee with an allergy to shellfish or peanuts that was so severe it was life-threatening, might be covered under ADA. A reasonable accommodation would be for the employer to provide an alternate meal free of the allergens for that employee.

Even though this policy is legal, it may not have been a wise move by the employers. It sounds like this job is stressful, and a relaxing half-hour meal break was a bright spot for employees to look forward to during the work day. It may have made them more productive during work hours. If it is presented in this light, the employer may reconsider this policy. However, while this new policy is annoying and severely impacts working conditions for the employees, it is lawful. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hello, i am an employer of a small business. I have 2 fulltime employees under me that consistantly work 40 hour weeks.
One of my employees maintains that he should only have to work 7.5 hours per day, as he claims he takes no breaks and eats no lunch (even though he has a cooler with him everyday and is consistantly pulling out of the local convienent store and/or fast food establishment).
I was always under the contention that an employee must work 8.5 hours per day to be paid for 8 (assuming .5 hrs is taken as an unpaid lunch).
I also believe it is state law that i must provide him with the 30 min non paid lunch break (which i have always been willing to do).
Thoughts?
Thanks
Rodney

Hi Rodney! As the employer, you should set the meal break policy in the workplace, rather than letting the employee do so.

Under Minnesota law, you must allow the employee sufficient time to eat a meal when he works a shift of 8 hours or more. This time can be unpaid if the employee is relieved of all duties. In this case, you are currently allowing the employee to take an on-duty meal break, working while he is eating. Therefore, he is entitled to payment for the meal break. However, there is no requirement that you must allow him to leave a half hour early to compensate for the fact that he is not taking a formal meal break. You could require that the employee work for 8 or 8.5 hours per day, as long as you pay him for all time worked, and pay overtime if applicable.

The best practice would be for you to require your employees to clock out for a 30-minute unpaid lunch each day. Studies have shown that employees who take a meal break are more productive—they get more work done in less time. If an employee works 8 am—4:30 pm with a 30-minute unpaid meal break, he should be paid for 8 hours. If an employee works 8 am to 3:30 pm and takes an on-duty lunch, he should be paid for 7.5 hours. Don’t let this employee trick you into paying him for 8 hours when he only works 7.5 hours.

No employer should ever allow an employee who is“on the clock”to leave the premises, such as going to a convenience store or fast food restaurant. This is an extremely risky practice. If the employee got into an accident, you would be liable because he was on the clock, and presumably on company business. You should make it clear to the employee that he must clock out before leaving the premises.

If you do not have a time clock, you need a sign-in sheet. You should require employees to sign in and out, and to sign out for their meal breaks before taking them. This is a complex issue, so feel free to post more questions. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hi Amelia. good column, very informational. my company seems to using lunch breaks as a means to keep its employees around in case business picks up in the afternoon. like we are on call but on lunch. if things don’t pick up after our lunch, they start cutting junior guys. It is a construction company and we as employees hav a union contract that allows the company to give out as much as one hour lunches. you talked about company policies, do these have to be written and posted in our contract and if not in our contract can they make policies without union approval? these lunch policies occasionally prevent the employee from reaching an 8 hour day. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanx, Greg

Hi Greg! Thanks for the kind words! Yes, the emloyer can change company policies at any time, as long as they are not violating the union contract or the law. If a matter is not addressed in a union contract, the company can set any policy that is legal. There is no requirement that policies be in writing.

Under federal law, the employer cannot require you to take more than a one-hour lunch on the premises. If they required you to take a two-hour lunch while waiting for work, you would be entitled to payment for one hour as waiting time. However, there is no federal or Minnesota law that prevents the employer from giving workers a one-hour unpaid lunch and requiring them to remain on the premises during that time. Nor is there any federal or Minnesota law that requires an employer to give workers an 8-hour shift. There is also no law that would prevent an employer from sending the worker home early.

In some states a“reporting pay law”requires that an employee scheduled for an 8-hour shift be paid for at least half of it, even if he is sent home after 5 minutes. Minnesota has no such law.

It sounds like the union contract gives the company the ability to require employees to take a lunch break of up to one hour. So we suspect that this employer is in compliance. Nevertheless, you could certainly complain to the union and ask them to look into this matter. That is what the union is for. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

My work is changing their hours from 9:00 to 5:00 with a 30 minute unpaid lunch break to 8:00-5:00 with an unpaid hour lunch break. An hour is a long time in perspective. What other companies make you take an hour break? If the break is over 20 minutes for lunch then they technically do not have to pay you for your break, correct? I know with our current hours, most of us don’t take breaks, we eat at our desks. My concern is if we stay in the office and eat at the conference table on our one hour break, can our boss legally try to make us work during this time? We’re afraid if we stick around during these times, she may try to give us more work.

Hi Jen! Actually, it is fairly common for employers to give workers a one-hour lunch break. About 38% of all employers who give lunch breaks, give a 60-minute break. That is where the phrase“lunch hour”came from. Many of these employers allow the employees to leave the premises on their lunch hour, but some do not.

You are correct that under the federal FLSA, an employee need not be paid for a lunch break that is 20 minutes or more. However, that is true only if the employee is relieved of all duty during his or her lunch break. The employee can be required to remain on the premises during an unpaid lunch break in Minnesota. If the employee has to work while eating, the employee is entitled to payment for the entire meal break. An employee who has to remain“on duty”is always entitled to payment for her lunch break. For example, a receptionist who has to eat at the front desk to be available to answer the phone when it rings, or greet a customer if someone comes in, is entitled to payment for that time. In fact, even if the phone does not ring and no customer comes in, she is still entitled to payment for that time because she was not“relieved of all duties.”

Your best bet is to follow the new policy by taking a 60-minute unpaid break each day. If your boss requires you to work during your meal break, then you should be paid for that time. If you are not paid for that time, you should tactfully discuss it with your supervisor or the HR department. If they still decline to pay you for the time, you should file a wage complaint with the Minnesota Department of Labor&amp;Industry at http://www.dli.mn.gov/main.asp or the U.S. Department of Labor at http://www.dol.gov .

Theoretically, you and your coworkers could file a wage complaint because you have been working without pay during your lunch breaks. However, if you were doing this voluntarily, without being told that you must, the employer could discipline or terminate you and your coworkers for not following company policy. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Ok I have asked this before been then have been getting Notification from this site of similar qestions. There are people at my work that are getting written up for break time issues. We work a 12 hour shift and are only given 3 15min breaks. Because we use lead in our Process we can not eat on the floor and must travel to a break area that is sometimes 5-8 mins of walk time away. Because of the travel time we generally use up most of our break time up in walking to the break rooms and this general cause people to to get written up. What are the Laws on break time and lunch time in Minnesota for a 12 hour shift that requires you to eat in a lunch room? There are a bunch of us that feel were getting treated wrong by their break policies they have in there employee handbook and have been enforcing with write ups. They have it in their handbook that the 12hr shift gets only 3 15min breaks nothing about travel time or lunch break. How does one go about dealing with this if were right about them not providing us with enought time? We have tried to use the company’s employee board to adress this issue but they just plain out refuse to even look at redoing their break policy. I present to the board the break laws you have shown on this page and they just tell me you can’t believe everything on the internet. Any suggestions?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Shane! Yes, we have a few suggestions.

First, the article you are looking at is from 2006. Just to update: For meal breaks, Minnesota law requires that an employee be given“sufficient time to eat a meal”on a shift of 8 hours or more. This includes a 12-hour shift. Unlike other states, Minnesota does not designate how long that meal break must be, but usually it is required to be 15-20 minutes or more. In your case, a meal break longer than 15 minutes may be required, because due to the nature of your work with lead, 15 minutes is not enough time for an employee to eat a meal.

For rest breaks, Minnesota law requires only that the employee be permitted enough time to use the nearest bathroom, at about the midpoint of each 4-hour work segment. It sounds like you are receiving that, and more.

Federal law does not require that employees be given any meal or rest breaks at all. However, the federal FLSA and Minnesota law require that an employee be paid for any break that is shorter than 20 minutes .

The employer is right about one thing—you can’t believe everything you read on the internet. But here is the link from the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry Website about meal breaks: http://www.dli.mn.gov/LS/FaqHours.asp . That site says exactly the same thing we are saying. And here is a“Know Your Rights”brochure from the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry: http://www.dli.mn.gov/LS/Pdf/rights_eng_pink.pdf HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~Amelia

I was just reading over a few post on this blog and have been getting really confused on what the laws are actually. In one post you stated that“Minnesota employees are entitled to a meal break of 20 minutes or more when working an 8-hour shift. Employees working shorter shifts need not be given meal breaks.”Another blog the Qestion was asked“I understand that an employer has to give the employee a 30 minute lunch break for 8 hours work. My question is, does MN law state that an
employee has to take that 30 minute break? Sometimes I just don’t want to”.
And then you stated”The problem is that in Minnesota, if you do not take a break, your employer is breaking the law. Several states have systems in place where an employee can decline a statutory meal break. Minnesota does not. The only way for the Minnesota employer to stay in compliance with the law is to require you to take the break. Many employers also require that workers take unpaid meal breaks to save payroll dollars. This is perfectly legal in any state.”and then On my qestion it was stated”Under Minnesota law, an employee who works a shift of 8 consecutive hours or more must be given sufficient time to eat a meal during the shift. If the time allowed is less than 20 minutes, it must be paid. (Employees can negotiate a different arrangement under a union contract.) Apparently the employer is counting the three 15-minute breaks as one or more meal periods. You can file a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry, but as long as you are being paid for the three breaks, the employer is probably in compliance. Theoretically, at least, an employer cannot lawfully take action against an employee for filing a complaint.”Now I have talked to some other so called Lawyer pages and they have Stated that there should be 3 10min breaks and one 1/2 launch break min. In our case what is the right answer. If were going to go to the next step of fileing a formal complaint and rattle some cages I would like to know what the right answer is? Because we have several issues at work with OSHA rule’s regarding lead and the break policy in the employee handbook that they are enforcing by right-ups and have fired a few employees over. Can you please clear things up?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Shane! Yes, we can clear this up for you. On a 12-hour shift you are entitled to“sufficient time to eat a meal”in Minnesota. The law does not specify any certain length of time. In some industries, 15 minutes would be sufficient. However, because of the specific nature of your work, handling lead which is a toxic metal, 15 minutes is not enough time for you to travel to the lunch room, eat the meal and return.

You are also entitled to a bathroom break in each 4-hour work segment that is long enough for you to use the nearest toilet. The Minnesota law does not require that you be given a break for other activities such as smoking, talking on the cell phone, relaxing or drinking coffee. It only requires that you be given enough time ot use the nearest toilet—not 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

There is no Minnesota law that requires three 10-minute rest breaks and a 30-minute meal break. (Some states have such laws, but Minnesota does not.) Here are the links to the actual Minnesota laws, in case you want to read them or print them and show them to your employer: https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=177.253 , https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=177.254 , https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/?id=5200.0120 .

One important exception: if you are working under a union contract that contains another agreement about meal or rest breaks, then the employer can follow the union contract or collective bargaining agreement instead of the state law.

You can certainly file a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry or MDLI at: dli.laborstandards@state.mn.us , (651) 284-5070 or 1-800-DIAL-DLI (1-800-342-5354). Your complaint would be based on the fact that although you are given three 15-minute breaks, the nature of your work with toxic chemicals makes it impossible for you to get to the lunch room, eat, and get back to work within the 15 minutes. Be sure to mention that you work with lead and it takes 5 to 8 minutes to reach a lunch room where you can safely eat, in your conversation with them —a fact you neglected to mention in your first post with us. You should also mention that several employees have been fired because they took enough time to eat a meal on a 12-hour shift, rather than return after 15 minutes. The MDLI may agree with you, or they may agree with the employer, but you will never know until you file a complaint.

Here is the problem: The employer is not legally required to give you the three 15-minute rest breaks. If you can get to the nearest restroom, use the toilet and return in 3 minutes or 5 minutes, that is all they are required to give you. So if your complaint is successful, they may switch to giving you an unpaid 30-minute meal break and three paid 5-minute bathroom breaks each day. It sounds like you might prefer that, because at least you would be able to eat. However, some of your coworkers might resent being paid for 11.5 hours each day instead of 12 hours.

In spite of that, we think you should file a complaint because it is the right thing to do. The employer is breaking the law, and someone should stop them. By all means, if you have additional worker safety complaints relating to lead, or people are eating in areas that contain lead, file a complaint with OSHA at http://www.OSHA.gov .

Once you file the complaint with MDLI or OSHA, they will investigate the complaint. OSHA may come on site and inspect the workplace. Even if they find the employer has done nothing wrong, by law no one can penalize you for filing a complaint in good faith.

The employees who were fired for not returning from break on time could also speak to an attorney specializing in employment law about a wrongful termination lawsuit. Apparently they were fired illegally, for taking enough time to eat a meal, as provided by Minnesota law. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

So on our break if we want to smoke we have to leave the property. To leave the property we must punch out. Does this mean i loose the right to have my break paid? And does this mean if they are requiring me to punch out and not be paid that I should be getting a 20 minute paid break?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi JJW! This is a tricky issue. There is no law that an employer in Minnesota or any other state must allow workers to smoke during the work day. They could make the entire property non-smoking, and not allow you to leave the property during your breaks. Many employers including most hospitals do this.

Instead, it appears the employer allows you to smoke, but only if you leave the property on your break. That is reasonable. It is also reasonable for them to require that you clock out. If you did not, and were in an accident, it would be workers’comp. The employer could even be liable for the accident, if you injured someone else while on the clock.

Under federal law, employees must be paid for a break that is shorter than 20 minutes. So theoretically, if you clock out for a smoke break shorter than 20 minutes, you should be paid for it. If the employer is having you clock out for a 20-minute break off the property, there is no requirement that you be paid for it. Either way, the employer is going far beyond what they are required to provide as breaks in Minnesota. We are not sure why you would think you should get a 20-minute paid break.

Our advice is that you choose your battles carefully. If you are not being paid for smoke breaks shorter than 20 minutes, you can certainly file a complaint about that. In that case, the employer will probably eliminate smoke breaks entirely, and employees would be required to work their full shift without smoking a cigarette. Your coworkers might not appreciate you causing that change in policy.

As you read in the article above, Minnesota law requires that employees be given a paid break sufficient to use the nearest toilet once every four hours. That does not include smoking, making cell phone calls, or other activities that can be conducted in the bathroom—it merely includes use of the toilet. So if you complain, the employer might decide to do away with all breaks except the required bathroom break. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hello Amelia.
I have a question regarding scheduling. If we are being scheduled 7.5 hours, but actually end up working 8 or more hours due to the store getting busy. Do we have to take a meal break?
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi David! Yes. The Minnesota meal break law applies to employees who work more than 8 hours, regardless of what the schedule is. The statute specifically mentions the word“work.”HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~ Amelia

Hello,
I am a hourly employee in Minnesota. Its been common practice that we need to take a One Hour (unpaid) lunch break for a 8 hour work day. Now with the 2 paid 15 min breaks we get, that is a lot of breaks (1.5 hours of breaks).

I am reading a lot about employers needing to give a 30 min (unpaid) break. Is there anything written that I have to take a One Hour (unpaid) lunch break?

Thank you
 
Posted by: Amelia 

Hi Todd! It is legal for a Minnesota employer to require employees to take a 60-minute unpaid lunch break. The employer can write up or fire any employee who refuses to follow this company policy.

Generally an employer cannot require that an employee clock out and remain on the premises for more than an hour, under federal law. However, a 60-minute unpaid meal break is fairly routine. That’s why it’s called a“lunch hour.”

Your employer is not required by law to give you any paid rest breaks.

The references to a 30-minute unpaid meal break are the MINIMUM that a Minnesota employer MUST provide. However, they are not the MAXIMUM that the Minnesota employer MAY require.

If you feel you are receiving too many breaks, you can certainly ask your employer to allow you to take just a 30-minute unpaid break—but there is no law that they must agree. Or, you could volunteer to work through your two paid 15-moinute breaks. HTH, and thanks for reading the blogs!~Amelia
