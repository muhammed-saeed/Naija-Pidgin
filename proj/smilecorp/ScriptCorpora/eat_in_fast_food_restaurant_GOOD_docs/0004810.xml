 New Headlights Make Raindrops Disappear 
 By Miss Cellania on Jul 12, 2012 at 11:00 am 

 Do you ever have trouble driving through rain at night because every raindrop reflects your headlights? Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute has developed a new type of car headlight that reduces glare from falling rain or snow. The technology is akin to running between the raindrops -with light! Associate robotics professor Srinivasa Narasimhan explained:
 
The system uses a camera to track the motion of raindrops and snowflakes and then applies a computer algorithm to predict where those particles will be just a few milliseconds later. The light projection system then adjusts to deactivate light beams that would otherwise illuminate the particles in their predicted positions.

“A human eye will not be able to see that flicker of the headlights,” Narasimhan said. “And because the precipitation particles aren’t being illuminated, the driver won’t see the rain or snow either.”

To people, rain can appear as elongated streaks that seem to fill the air. To high-speed cameras, however, rain consists of sparsely spaced, discrete drops. That leaves plenty of space between the drops where light can be effectively distributed if the system can respond rapidly, Narasimhan said.

In their lab tests, Narasimhan and his research team demonstrated that their system could detect raindrops, predict their movement and adjust a light projector accordingly in 13 milliseconds. At low speeds, such a system could eliminate 70 to 80 percent of visible rain during a heavy storm, while losing only 5 or 6 percent of the light from the headlamp.
 
And if the system fails, the lights will still function as normal headlights. Link -via The Week

 Regarding Yodeling 
 By Miss Cellania on Jul 12, 2012 at 10:00 am 

 
( YouTube link )

To hear authentic Swiss yodeling, you need to go to the mountains of Switzerland…or watch a video by someone who did. NatGeo’s Digital Nomad Andrew Evans recorded Swiss yodeler Amadé Perrig, a cowherd who grew up yodeling in the Alps. He also learned quite a bit about the art.
 
Cow- and goatherds used yodeling as a way to call across from one mountain to another. It was a rudimentary (albeit beautiful) way to communicate. Certain sounds and notes actually meant words, so in a way, yodeling began as a kind of melodic language of the mountains.

Although you couldn’t see a fellow cowherd across the valley, you could hear him, and you would yodel back. Like bird calls, sending out feelers to see who’s out there and listening to the responding calls that come back.

I like to think how long before two teenagers picked up their phones and started texting one another, one would stand tall on a rock on some mountainside and yodel some little phrase across the valley to the other, who would yodel back.
 
Read a lot more about yodeling in Switzerland at National Geographic’s Intelligent Travel blog. Link -Thanks, Marilyn!

 Giraffe Rescued from Septic Tank 
 By Miss Cellania on Jul 12, 2012 at 9:00 am 

 A full-grown giraffe became stuck when its weight apparently caused a septic tank to collapse at the Marloth Park wildlife preserve in South Africa. Veterinarian Cobus Raath and a team of rescuers worked to free the animal.
 
Dr Raath said his team blindfolded the giraffe and put cotton wool in it ears to try and calm the animal down.

They then tied a rope around his head and pulled it down towards the ground while a team of 20 volunteers helped heave it out of the hole.

“The animal was distressed and had been trying to get out,”he said.

“We decided not to incapacitate him but blindfolded him to try and calm him down.

“We then called a load of local people who rushed to help and we used ropes and brute force to pull him out of the hole sideways.”

The operation took about 20 minutes to get him out.
 
The giraffe was treated for shock and was freed after appearing to recover nicely. Link -via Arbroath

 Harbor the Rescue Raccoon 
 By Miss Cellania on Jul 12, 2012 at 6:30 am 

 

Harbor the raccoon was kept in a small cage for four years and become almost completely blind before wildlife rehabilitator MaryEllen Schoeman took him in. She washed, fed, and cuddled him, then introduced him to his new custom-made enclosure, where he can run, climb, and play in water. His recovery was amazing, and he now an active and joyful raccoon.
 
“I have worked with raccoons for many years, and I can honestly say that I have never encountered one who greets each day with such happiness, and who loves so fully and so deeply. He loves his pool, his toys and every single person he meets.”-MaryEllen Schoeman

 6 Famous Misquotes&amp;Where They Came From 
 By Jill Harness on Jul 12, 2012 at 5:04 am 

You’ve probably heard most of these misquotes aren’t accurate already, but what you might not know is where they actually originated and how they ended up getting associated with certain famous people and characters. Here’s your chance to learn how misattribution and miswording can become someone’s longest lasting legacy.

1. “Let Them Eat Cake”

 

Perhaps the most famous misquote of all time, you almost certainly already knew she never actually said this line. What you might not know is where the line comes from. As it turns out“Qu’ils mangent de la brioche,”was first written in Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Confessions , an autobiography he started to write while Antoinette was only nine years old. In fact, Marie didn’t even arrive in France until after Rousseau completed the book.

The quote itself was said to have come from a “great princess,” but he never actually lists the princess by name and many believe he completely made the story up. Others speculate that it was referring to Maria Theresa of Spain or one of Louis XV’s daughters, either Madame Sophie and Madame Victoire.

As for Marie, she was actually quite sweet and felt bad for the impoverish people of her country, even if she didn’t let it stop her from living a rather lavish lifestyle. In fact, when there was a bread shortage during her reign, she wrote to her family in Austria saying,“It is quite certain that in seeing the people who treat us so well despite their own misfortune, we are more obliged than ever to work hard for their happiness.”

It wasn’t until 1843, almost 75 years after Rousseau completed Confessions and over 50 years since Marie was executed, that the quote was attributed to her for the first time by Alphonse Karr in “Les Guepes. While none of this makes it any better that the Queen has been so wrongly villainized by the quote, at least now you know the story.

2. “Elementary, My Dear Watson”

 

Here’s another one that’s famous for being inaccurate, but people still like to quote it whenever a reference to Sherlock Holmes comes up. In all of the sixty Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this phrase never once comes up, although Holmes does say both “elementary” and “my dear Watson” –just never together.

As for the origin of the phrase, well, it was first used in the 1915 P.G. Wodehouse novel Psmith, Journalist . It later appeared in the first Sherlock Holmes sound film, The Return of Sherlock Holmes , which premiered in 1929. Neither of these sources were enough to make it the famous misquote it is today though. Indeed, that honor goes to writer Edith Meiser’s regular use of the line in The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes radio series that was broadcast  between 1939 and 1947.

3. “Play It Again, Sam”

 I’ll Buy All The Games You Have, Thanks

Remember when you were a youngster and you told yourself that it was ok that just just spent all of your savings on a video game because it was an“investment?”Well, for most of us, that was just a lie, but for one collector, that ended up being the truth -he just made $1.2 million for his gaming collection.

Of course, this was no ordinary collection. In fact, it actually contained every game ever made for every Sega, Nintendo and NEC system -a total of around 7,000 games, all of which came in the box complete with their instruction manual. Some of the games haven’t even been opened.

It puts your childhood collection to shame, doesn’t it?

 Official Olympics Outfit of Team USA: Chic or Dud?

Behold the official Olympics outfits for Team USA. Designed by Ralph 
 Lauren, the official outfitter of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams, 
 the new duds have got some people screaming foul:
 
 Before they slip into something more comfortable, like say, leotards 
 or weightlifting belts, Team USA will greet the world at the opening 
 ceremony for the London Olympics in classic Americana style by Ralph 
 Lauren. 

 Too bad they’re made in China—and that there’s 
 a beret.
Men will wear navy blazers with the Olympic team patch, along with red, 
 white and blue neckties and white pants. Women will pair the blazers 
 with a white dress or skirt and a scarf. 

 Both blazers are emblazoned with the in-your-face“Big Pony”logo—a mistake say some branding experts and celebrity stylists. 
 
And how much do they cost?
 
 The price of all this made-in-China preppiness—if you for 
 some reason want to buy it—$598 for the women’s blazer 
 and $498 for the silk skirt. The men’s blazer is a staggering 
 $795, flat front trousers $295 and nubuck shoes are $165. And that damn 
 beret? $55.

 Homeland Security’s New Molecular Scanner 
 By Alex on Jul 11, 2012 at 6:00 pm 


 

Still fretting about privacy? Don&apos;t worry, it will soon be over. Big 
 Brother will know everything about you with this new molecular scanner 
 that sounds like it&apos;s straight out of Star Trek:
 
 Within the next year or two, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
 will instantly know everything about your body, clothes, and luggage 
 with a new laser-based molecular scanner fired from 164 feet (50 meters) 
 away. From traces of drugs or gun powder on your clothes to what you 
 had for breakfast to the adrenaline level in your body—agents 
 will be able to get any information they want without even touching 
 you. 

 And without you knowing it. 

 The technology is so incredibly effective that, in November 2011, 
 its inventors were subcontracted 
 by In-Q-Tel to work with the US Department of Homeland Security. 
 In-Q-Tel is a company founded&quot; in 
 February 1999 by a group of private citizens at the request of the 
 Director of the CIA and with the support of the U.S. Congress.&quot;According to In-Q-Tel, they are the bridge between the Agency and new

 Bloodsucking Parasite Named After Bob Marley 
 By Alex on Jul 11, 2012 at 5:00 pm

Scientists have certainly stirred it up some with this: they&apos;ve named 
 a parasite that feed on blood after the reggae legend Bob Marley.
 
 Paul Sikkel, an assistant professor of marine ecology and a field 
 marine biologist at Arkansas State University, discovered and just named 
 after Marley a&quot;gnathiid isopod&quot;--a small parasitic crustacean 
 blood feeder that infests certain fish that inhabit the coral reefs 
 of the shallow eastern Caribbean. Sikkel named the species Gnathia marleyi. 
 [...] 

 Sikkel said,&quot;I named this species, which is truly a natural 
 wonder, after Marley because of my respect and admiration for Marley&apos;s 
 music. Plus, this species is as uniquely Caribbean as was Marley.&quot;

 CDC’s Wedding Day Survival Guide 
 By Alex on Jul 11, 2012 at 4:00 pm 


 

After warning 
 the public about the dangers of zombies , the CDC decided to tackle 
 something even more dangerous: weddings!
 
 Emergencies could range from a tear in your wedding gown, tornado, 
 health issues, monster-in-laws, or bridezilla on the loose. It’s 
 important to be aware of the possible issues and to do your homework. 
 Just like you know the risks of putting feuding family members in one 
 room, you should also know to check the weather report. 

 You never know when Bridezilla might pop up. When dealing with 
 an emotional bride, try to remember your loved one is probably stressed 
 out and will soon return to her caring self after the wedding is over. 
 Be supportive and have some bottled water from your emergency kit and 
 a box of chocolate on hand.
