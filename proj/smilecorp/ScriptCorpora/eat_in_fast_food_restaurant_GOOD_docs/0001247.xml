I used to use them a few times a week before I got my car and now use them mostly for airport service. They are very reliable and make an honest living in my opinion. They have picked me up during snow storms and emergencies and have never let me down. Love them!

Terrible service. They overcharge and take forever to get to you. I live three blocks from them and had to wait more than 20 mins. Driver didn&apos;t even know where Cobble Hill was, didn&apos;t know Smith St. Disgusting all around.

Alex II is OK in my book.  I had to go to an unfamiliar section of Brooklyn and my car was out of commission, so I gave these guys a ring.  The dispatcher was very helpful and clear.  The driver was polite and on time, his driving style didn&apos;t make me fear for my life like many car service operators are wont to do, and he actually got me to my appointment early.  The price was very reasonable, also.  Next time I need car service I&apos;ll definitely keep Alex II in mind.

These guys are no nonsense.  They have plenty of drivers so the most time that you&apos;ll have to wait for a car is 5 minutes.

When I was pregnant in the winter, their drivers were more than happy to help me get from the building to the car when the sidewalks were icey.  They took great care of me and were so accomodating.

Thanks!

I called a day in advance to book a car.  They called me back before the car came so they could charge my card and sent the receipt with the driver.  The driver showed up on time (5 min early in fact), helped me put my stuff in the car and was safe while driving.  Not much else you need from a car service.  I&apos;ll definitely use them again.

I called to schedule a pick up for a friend leaving the next morning at 5AM to LaGuardia.  The man on the phone was extremely rude and impatient.  When I asked him to wait one moment before giving my friend&apos;s credit card information over the phone (a moment for my friend to simply had me his card), the man screamed at me to &quot;just give me the number&quot;.  I got off the phone and sometime later at 12:45 AM the man called my house phone back, waking everyone up, to ask if I wanted to put the tip on the credit card charge or if we would be tipping in cash.  He didn&apos;t seem to understand that his behavior was completely inappropriate.  I was flabbergasted to think that he would call that late (or early) before a very early pick up to the airport to ask about tips when he was so completely flippant with me over the phone.  Extremely poor customer service.  The  car arrived on time, but that&apos;s the last time I&apos;ve used their service.  It pays to be nice to people.
