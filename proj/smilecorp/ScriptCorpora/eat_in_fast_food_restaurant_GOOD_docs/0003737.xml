Essential Formulas 
 
Nourishing whole-health dietary supplements and cosmeceuticals from Japan. 

Categories: Supplements&amp;Homeopathics , Skin Care 
Attributes: Vegan About the company EFI President and CEO Michael Schoor learned about Dr. Ohhira’s probiotic formula while traveling in Malaysia in 1997. While visiting Kuala Lumpur, Michael experienced serious digestive discomfort after eating at a local fast-food restaurant. Finding himself without his usual remedy from home, he consulted a local doctor who recommended a product from Japan known as OM-X.

The probiotic capsules helped immediately and substantially. In fact, the product worked more effectively than anything Michael had used before. He noticed that he felt better faster, and didn’t have any negative side effects. Michael was so impressed by the results that he set out to learn all he could about the little brown capsules that had stopped his digestive discomfort in its tracks. His search ultimately led him to Japan where he met the formulator of the mysterious capsules, Dr. Iichiroh Ohhira, one of Japan’s leading microbiologists.*

Dr. Ohhira educated Michael about the digestive health formula. Supported by over twenty university-based scientific studies, the capsules contained not only probiotics, but also prebiotics (substances that nourish probiotics) and organic acids that promote a healthy digestive tract pH. No wonder Dr. Ohhira’s formula was so helpful; it was a lot more than just a probiotic supplement. Michael was determined to share it with American consumers.*
