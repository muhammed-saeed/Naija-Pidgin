Are they closed? I tend to take Yelp with a grain of salt.
 http://www.yelp.com/biz/eton-brooklyn-2 

More interesting (for me) their FB page says they are now selling their dumplings at local markets. I&apos;m addicted to dumplings so this is big news for me

Too bad, because the idea of a decent dumpling place in the neighborhood was exciting, but I&apos;m not surprised. The one time I went there the staff seemed pretty incompetent. I never went back. The dumplings were very good, but not worth the long wait, and the atmosphere of the eating area was not worth a second visit.

I loved their vegetarian dumplings, but I did not like any of their other vegetarian foods at all. I would need like 3 orders of just dumplings to make a meal since there wasn&apos;t anything else I could/would eat...meaning I didn&apos;t order from there too often. I assumed they would have done well, though.

The place was not that good, Vanderbilt has become too competitive for a place of Eton&apos;s incompetence to open up and expect to stay in business. No chance for places like this in the new Vanderbilt.

I was really bummed when this place closed. I ate there at least once a week since the day it opened. Granted it was under staffed and the dumplings took for ever, sometimes up to 25 minutes. there pulled pork was very good though and it was all reasonably priced. its a nice little spot and im sure another food vendor will move in soon. I would kill for a hanko&apos;s or other vietnamese sandwich shop.

I allways saw the owner of eton talking to the guy who owns the taco place next door. Next time i get a burrito i will ask what happened.

On a side note the hipster white guy that worked there the last several months now works at the bagel place down the street.

I thought the food was prett good, but as others have said, it was not worth the wait. I went there about five times and it always took at least 20 minutes for them to have my order ready. Given how fast Vanderbilt is developing, I&apos;m sure something will come along to replace Eton soon enough.

This place sucked. Mediocre food and worse service. A dumpling place could&apos;ve done well, just not this dumpling place.

Speaking of Maya Taqueria, I really like their food, but there also kind of rude.

Maya workers are kind of rude in that out-to-lunch (so to speak) way: they don&apos;t know how to behave properly, especially when the owner/some workers&apos; father isn&apos;t there. It&apos;s like that at Met Food, too. The owners&apos; adult children are there most of the time, and when Frank and Abdul aren&apos;t there, they are just tuned out. No greetings, no chit-chat, none of what makes a neighborhood store/restaurant the kind of place you want to return to.

I think the owner kind of sets the tone at Maya. He is always stone faced, never says hello, thank you or goodbye. When your food is done he just tosses it in a bad and shoves toward you. It feels like the kind of service you get at a fast food restaurant, not a locally owned one.

Too bad.

I think Maya could be improved with Spanish language soccer on TV, even if the owner does not speak Spanish.

...it would just put me more in the mood to enjoy my burrito

kid cashier once took tongs to give me nachos in my to-go order. Tongs fell on the floor --- still gave me chips.
10 second rule at Maya I guess.

BTW I liked eton -- only went there a couple of times but very mellow laid back atmosphere.

Maya is a bit inconsistent. I hate to say it but Chipotle tends to be better. If Maya doesnt have a certain sauce they don&apos;t say no, they just give you something else. Has happened to me twice. I also agree with the rude/childish comments above.

I really like mexican food but have only gone there 10 times in 18 months. I can say they are better than Pequena, just on price alone. That place is also inconsistent as all hell (I did like them the first two times i went -- the last 3 sucked).

I think the best cheaper stuff on the block is Soda or Usual.

Kept waiting for Eton to fire up the shave ice equipment this summer but it never seemed to happen. I liked their plate lunch and they seemed like nice dudes.

Maya is certainly inconsistant and it wouldn&apos;t kill them to post a menu sign on the back wall rather than taping a single menu to their countertop. There&apos;s some other half-assery ( no pork at a &apos;mexican&apos; place?) but when you&apos;re hungry, you&apos;re hungry. Kid and father don&apos;t seem to treat their customers nor their employees with any regard.

Chipotle is awful food. That is all.

0 seconds would be preferred, but 5 seconds is a step in the right direction.

I hereby propose that the former site of Eton be considered by the proprietor of a takeout Gyro/Falafel place.

Sad that Eton is gone. Glad he&apos;s still serving up dumplings in his old spot. Worth the trip if you have a craving imo.
I think it&apos;s really cool that the owner of Maya has his kid in there working. If he would of dropped the tongs in front of me I would of called him out on it. That&apos;s the sort of stuff he&apos;s in there to learn - Common Sense!

If I have to schlep all the way over to Carroll Gardens then I might as well jump on the B train to Prosperity Dumpling:

Totally different dumpling. I take no sides, I love all types, but Eton does it&apos;s own thing. Nothing like a chinatown dumpling or like the kind you get around here at local Chinese shops, or even the Dumplings&amp;Things place in PS.

The now closed location of Eton on Vanderbilt is presently being renovated.

A reliable source informs me that it will become &quot;a grill place. You know, burgers and wings. A mix of takeout and eat in.&quot;

Thanks for the update. I&apos;m officially &quot;meh&quot; about that description, though I will reserve judgement until the new place opens up.

FWIW, the Back Grill has the same contractor&apos;s poster in the window as Fish Fish Mo Fish.

The Back 9 Grill is supposed to have a golf theme, as in the &quot;back 9 holes&quot;.

The Brownstoner thread is so typical of the posters on that site. They hate any and everything and get so worked up over a lousy bar. I wish this place well and hope that is succeeds. I plan to give it a try before condemning it or predicting that it will fail.

If we&apos;re lucky, Dale Bozzio, lead singer of Missing Persons will hang out here. I&apos;m sure that she loves golf.

If I was going to open a golf themed restaurant, I think it would be based on the movie Caddyshack.

Over and over, I&apos;d play that song the groundhog dances to...

And today the Back 9 Grill had the contractor&apos;s poster removed. (Can&apos;t say for sure when it disappeared, but it was definitely gone.)

Bricktop -- sounds about right.

I&apos;m not particularly excited about a proliferation of sports themed restaurants...Plan B has great food and fills the need on Vandy, IMHO. I&apos;m dreading the onslaught of arena establishments that are about to come our way. Hopefully they will avoid the typical crappy food and beer standard that surrounds just about every other stadium in the US. Though, judging by the complete lack of creativity in the name, it&apos;s going to be totally run of the mill. And will likely get enough non-neighborhood clients who come for the arena events to survive.

I realize I&apos;m making a Brownstoner-like comment, but mediocre restaurants and bars really blow.

I&apos;m curious to see how many arena customers will venture far into the neighborhoods for food, and I&apos;m thinking not many. Certainly the area right around the arena will see some traffic, but not much else. At least, that&apos;s my hunch. I think most people are going to come there by the subway or LIRR, or in their cars on the BQE and quickly leave the area by the same route when the show is over.

Everyone who fears the arena is going to bring an onslaught of beer-and-wings franchises, please consider the following places that have opened since construction commenced on the Barclays Center: Chuko, The Vanderbilt, R&amp;D, a sushi place on the east side of Vandy, Pequena, Branded, Cornelius, Woodwork, something Hills ice creamery...some other places I&apos;m forgetting but you can be damn sure they didn&apos;t forget an arena was being built nearby when they opened for business. It&apos;s really lame to say the arena is going to ruin everything without taking into account all the facts. I hope it opens more commercial spaces along Atlantic Avenue which is still very blighted.

I agree, Chekhovian. I remember some guy named Ratnerville4ever posting on this board a few years back, predicting that the imminent arrival of the arena would hinder the development of a restaurant row on Vanderbilt. Oh, what prescience that guy had!

If the naysayers were correct, there would be no obstacles to the arrival of Hooters, which, sadly, seems like it won&apos;t be joining out list of local establishments. Boo-hoo.
