 van de dag 
 
 
 Young Woman With a Water Jug, Johannes Vermeer, c.1661 
 
Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675) of Delft was an innkeeper, art-dealer and modestly successful painter of domestic scenes. Never having had more than a local reputation his works weren&apos;t more widely known until he was rediscovered the 19th century. Only thirty-four of his paintings exist today and any museum owning one is automatically elevated to world class status. (For more, see Jon Boone&apos;s catalogue, here and his monologue on attribution, here ).

 Plenty of nothin&apos; 
 
The economy has already imploded and is now reinflated with volatile hydrogen-like fiat, just waiting for the right spark to bring the whole zeppelin crashing down in flames.
 Giordano Bruno, Neithercorp Press 

It is one thing to hold a theory that says something will happen, but it quite another to see it actually happening.
 Jesse, Jesse&apos;s CaféAméricain 
 
It&apos;s bad. Rigor and Mortis are running the housing industry, employment is still falling like a sack of concrete, finished goods prices are surging, the Treasury is borrowing back—with interest—the same dollars it gives away to the Federal Reserve, nuclear power plants are melting down and blowing up in Japan, month over month food prices shot up the most since Gerald Ford was President—that&apos;s before our western farm land gets dusted with radioactivity, inflation is spooling up big time, only antiquarians talk about &apos;consent of the governed&apos; any more, and hefty pieces of the economy are dropping off as it lurches like a leper to its final pratfall. Yeah, this will turn out well.

Baron Bodissey at Gates of Vienna says,
 
The Western welfare state is built out of enormous, unthinkable quantities of debt. It is the greatest Ponzi scheme in history, and its demise is mathematically inevitable. The only question is exactly when the scam starts to unravel in earnest.
 Article , The Shadow Knows, Part 1 
 
Meanwhile, our representative government is mainly representing itself. As Mat Negrin noted last week in Politico: 
 
President Obama&apos;s only event at the White House that isn&apos;t closed to the press on Wednesday is a ceremony in which he&apos;ll accept an award for being open to the press... 


 he also probably won&apos;t talk about his aggressive effort to prosecute federal workers who leak information to shed light on wrongdoing. Or that despite his anti-lobbyist rhetoric, his aides are meeting with lobbyists just outside the White House, allowing the administration to keep the meetings off the books from public view.
 Article , Obama flaunts openness award 
 
 Armed and Dangerous puts it this way:
 
The value of political persuasion is decreasing fast. Political persuasion matters most when when policy options are relatively open and unconstrained by objective conditions that politics cannot alter. It matters less when policy options are more constrained, and not at all when there are no choices left.
 Article , Politics as usual is over 
 
The fix is too far gone for politics to unfix. The economy trends ever downward but the robo-market trends ever upward, mainly by surfing on the Plunge Protection Team and POMO Bucks—a subsidy for day traders and TBTF s alike, dipping and spiking on no news and less volume. It&apos;s Sim Citi or Grand Theft Apple or Fantasy Bourseball, with the score kept in wealth-effect points. The weekly charts could be posted Monday mornings and save a lot of people a lot of time. Alas, levitating the market is costly and precarious. As Charles Smith at Of Two Minds points out,
 
The dynamic is clear, isn&apos;t it? Each new leg of the &quot;permanent Bull market&quot; requires a heavier dose of unprecedented intervention, denial, &quot;stimulus&quot; and obfuscation than the last one, yet the resulting Bull market is significantly shorter in duration than the previous run.
 Article , Volatility and the&quot;Permanent Bull Market&quot; 
 
Meanwhile, in the real world, productive folks live toe to toe with the worst kind of uncertainty, often close to destitution because they actually have to pay their debts and, oh yes, everybody else&apos;s too, foreign and domestic. It wasn&apos;t always this way. As a nation we once had plenty of money, plenty of time to fix what needed fixing, and plenty of plenty. And now we don&apos;t. Onliest things in the cash drawer are a stray button, some overdue notices and an i.o.u. The Big Money is sequestered in the entitlement plumbing, out of sight under the floor and behind the walls, so there&apos;s little of economic consequence to politic about. Jeffery Anderson at the Weekly Standard says,
 
The White House Office of Management and Budget projects that in the current fiscal year (2011), mandatory spending alone will exceed all federal receipts. So even if we didn&apos;t spend a single cent on discretionary programs, we still wouldn&apos;t be able to balance our budget this year let alone pay off any of the $14 trillion in debt that we have already accumulated.
 Article , Mandatory Spending to Exceed all Federal Revenues—50 Years Ahead of Schedule 
 
Unfortunately, mean ol&apos; Mr. Reality has entered the building and he&apos;s of a mind to put the pursuit back into the pursuit of happiness, which also means he&apos;ll delete free-fo&apos;-nothin&apos; from the list of inviolable human rights, betimes. Have a care, Mr. Reality moves fast. What&apos;s impossible today is probable tomorrow and accomplished fact the day after. He knows the tipping point is in the rear view mirror. He knows we&apos;re living amongst airborne rubble-to-be. For those who are paying attention his warnings have gone from background beeps to full-on flashing red lights and screech alarms. For those waiting for a &apos;breaking news&apos; alert and&quot;some sort of announcement&quot;here&apos;s the metric equivalent from Chris Martenson at chrismartenson.com :
 
It is with a heavy heart that I am now issuing the highest level alert to my readers than I have to date... The nuclear meltdown has led to a market meltdown. Market breaks can quickly lead to supply shortages and other unpleasant realities... The problem with these fast-moving situations is that everything shifts from beneath your feet and events fundamentally change so quickly that you do not have time to adjust properly before the next insult arrives. 
Article , Alert: Nuclear (and Economic) Meltdown In Progress 
 
Mr. Martenson goes on to say,&quot;a market rout is on...

Food, water, medical kits, shelter, cash out of the bank, and all the rest should absolutely be in place at this time. Get the basics done. Now.&quot;This may be an understatement. Most intend to remain where they are. If they don&apos;t have deep preparations by now it&apos;s probably too late. Good intentions and crafty calculations count for nothing, only preps count and only serious preps count for much. Thinking about doing it, knowing how to do it, making plans to do it isn&apos;t the same as doing it. Only doing it is doing it. Those planning to self-evacuate either have a prepared and provisioned bug out destination and proven, robustly redundant means to get there or they don&apos;t.

It&apos;s going down. This wholly illegitimate regime and the putrefying, corrupt and outright anti-Constitutional establishment it serves has its beneficiaries and protectors but no friends. Loyalty is being bought, not earned. One obvious tell: illegitimacy obviates accountability, our rulers feel quite free to display put their contempt for the citizenry. And they do. Notice how transparency is all one way. Notice how national elections have devolved from auctions on our future earnings to an elaborate hoax, and why not, we have government by prank where legislation is passed, published and debated, in that order. What they don&apos;t need with no steenking electorate. It&apos;s just one of the many ways they&apos;ve plugged those annoying&quot;avenues of redress&quot;, and so the rage seethes and builds. Look around, it passed the crisis level some time ago. But, and it&apos;s a huge but , efforts to contain it are faltering and visibly so. They&apos;re losing control of the citizenry and they&apos;re losing control of events. It&apos;s end-game stuff, we know it and they know it.

Nor is the economy failing by accident or bad luck or plain ol&apos; poor decisions. It&apos;s a final act common in history—they&apos;re looting the place. Sure, they all want in now, but when the Götterdämmerung really hits, their cadre won&apos;t be able to run away fast enough and their hangers-on will turn on it like ravenous dogs. It&apos;ll buckle all at once, with historic finality. In weeks, not months.

Perhaps there will be a transitional phase where one federal entity or another attempts to retrieve the irretrievable, but alas, they&apos;re all thoroughly corrupt, intrinsically or by long habit. Such neo-federalist concoctions will come to a bad end, a very bad end, and take down anyone stupid enough to sign on. More promising, several states are taking defensive measures,&quot;Tenth Amendment&quot;and&quot;sound money&quot;initiatives for instance, courageous steps given the ferocity of federal opposition. These may or may not stand up to the maelstrom. 
 

 The indispensable Giordano Bruno of Neithercorp Press says,
 
If there is anything good to come out of our present predicament, it is that Americans, from average citizens to elected officials, are beginning to understand the reality of coming collapse and are preempting it with measures designed to insulate their communities from the inevitable firestorm. Eventually, as this movement escalates, certain states will come out ahead of the pack, gaining a kind of safe haven status, and attracting liberty minded people from around the country to the protective shelter of their borders.
 Article , The Return Of Precious Metals And Sound Money 
 
Eventually, in one form or another, the sole legitimate authority—consent of the governed—will emerge but eventually can be a very long time, generations perhaps. The interim may make the Dark Ages look like Mardi Gras. When the unwinding goes critical, escape and evasion is the prudent first step for the near term, regrettably, near term commonly meaning a year or two but nobody really knows, nobody can know.

For those who plan to bug out,&quot;panic on the four-lane&quot;may be less a less dangerous proposition than&quot;wait a while and see for sure&quot;. The losers will be those who don&apos;t recognize the early phases for what they are. The winners will be those who decamp first, the meek as it were, the prepared who get out the door before the benighted stoics lose their nerve and jam it solid. Timing is everything, better a day too early than a minute too late. As always, get away from crowds and stay away from crowds.

In Woodpile Report 206 of 8 Mar 2011, ol&apos; Remus told you he was evaluating the Ronson-type Austrian Imco-Triplex Super 6700 lighter and considered it the pick of the litter. He really wanted this to be &apos;the one&apos;. Unfortunately its shortcomings have revealed themselves, namely, its internal components have become rattley, the&quot;press fit&quot;fuel reservoir cap has become a&quot;slip fit&quot;allowing fuel-vapor to escape, decreasing the time between fills, and the wick carbons up quite rapidly, although it&apos;s easily accessible and cleaned. Remus will continue to rely on his Zippo 44001 kits while the search continues for a one-hander as simple and reliable as a &apos;strike anywhere&apos; match.

 But don&apos;t worry - The Transportation Security Administration is re-analyzing the radiation levels of X-ray body scanners installed in airports nationwide, after testing produced dramatically higher-than-expected results.

 US nuclear power plant failures - An EMP event resulting in an extended grid down situation could cause a very similar event. There is only adequate diesel fuel on site to power emergency diesels for 7 days for most commercial nuclear plants in the USA . After that, you are in essentially the same situation as the Japanese find themselves - lack of power to provide any cooling to either the reactors or the spent fuel pools. Imagine if this event were to happen at multiple sites in the USA simultaneously, says B.Z. in his comment , Nuclear Incidents in Japan - The Truth and the Rumors , at Survival Blog .

 Source of subatomic particle spin, hypothesis - Here&apos;s the problem: it is not clear how the electron manages the rotational motion implied by its spin. If the electron had a radius, the implied surface would have to be moving faster than the speed of light, violating the theory of relativity. And experiments show that the electron does not have a radius; it is thought to be a pure point particle with no surface or substructure that could possibly spin.

We should not have to depend on the government of Japan or the IAEA to disseminate information about dangers to America. This is the job of domestic agencies like FEMA and the Office of the President of the United States.

 Wikileaks&apos; Julian Assange - &quot;While the Internet has in some ways an ability to let us know to an unprecedented level what government is doing... it is also the greatest spying machine the world has ever seen. It is not a technology that favours freedom of speech. It is not a technology that favours human rights.

 It&apos;s an NPR world - Liberals could easily fund all of public broadcasting with a shake of their wallets. But they wouldn&apos;t want to. Public broadcasting has an air of mission about it.

Obama is out of his element and is incapable of making the necessary decisions to protect American interests, much less foster an agenda that is in keeping with American sovereignty and values of individual freedom and liberty. While Rome burns, Obama is giving speeches, predicting basketball scores and golfing. The words that come to mind are apathetic, detached and pathetic.

The Middle East is not the big issue. We are facing a global famine and food crisis that is behind the political unrest. This is coming at a time when governments are broke. We have state and local governments in a debt crisis and that meltdown is VERY REAL !!!! Government is collapsing. That is the issue! ... what we are facing is a complete collapse in government debt, for the interest expenditures to keep rolling the debt are growing, displacing normal types of spending. The interest is consuming the total expenditure, and this is causing the total collapse in government debt.
 Martin Armstrong, How&amp;When , Armstrong Economics, via Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan 

 Municiple default - What do you get when states bring in increasingly diminished revenues while constituents demand more and more money for welfare and public services because of inflation and the subsequent rise in poverty? You get a space-time-debt singularity so volatile it stretches the very fabric of your local economy until it tears wide open, unleashing a gravity well of capital destruction similar to a double-ended tornado that snatches your money and hurls it into the upper stratosphere never to be seen again.
 Giordano Bruno, Neithercorp Press

Today I went to a fast food restaurant to grab a quick lunch and noticed a sign saying they would only put tomatoes on your sandwich if requested. Curious, I inquired about it and they said that a case of tomatoes went from $20 to $50 due to the freeze in Mexico. That got me to thinking. If even low levels of radiation hit the farms in CA from Japan, how much more will produce prices increase?

 Insolvency and inflation - Today we have no leaders and no advocates for the truth. We had better find some and do so soon, because the time for us to make elective choices in this regard and determine by some sort of representative process exactly how we&apos;re going to face the reality that we cannot hand out 1/3rd of all earnings dollars from government transfer payments is coming to a close. Following that time our realignment of priorities will be not a matter of choice but instead will be forced upon us.

 If the policy of the government upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties, in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.

 . . . . . 

 There&apos;s no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren&apos;t enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws ... pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted and you create a nation of law-breakers.
 Ayn Rand

 Woodpile Report does not maintain an archive. Some issues linger on the server until Remus gets around to deleting all but the previous three or four. Don&apos;t confuse Woodpile Report with a blog. It isn&apos;t. It&apos;s an olde tymme internet site made by hand and archives are a dispensable chore.
