 Fast food: the good, the bad, and the ugly [ArticleImageHyperLink] Friday, February 03, 2012 By Amber Mayer Advertising 
 
 

 We have all been there: There is no time to make a meal, so a fast food restaurant is the easiest choice. Food is all around us. 

 From the commercials on T.V. to the food at our houses, we are all influenced by unhealthy choices. 

 Since I work at McDonals, I know how the food is made, and how unhealthy it really is.  Even that doesn’t stop me or any other worker from eating it. 

 Not all fast food is unhealthy though; many fast food chains offer a selection of salads, along with parfaits, whole-wheat buns, and grilled chicken. Non-fat milk is also available at some restaurants. 

 Many of the vegetables that are on the subs, sandwiches, and tacos are fresh, kept in well refrigerated areas, and come to the stores on a weekly basis. 

 For people who are calorie counters and weight watchers many sit down places offer a low-carb low-calorie section to the menu, which can come in handy for some people. 

 Along with the good and healthy, there is also the bad and toxic. Much of the food at McDonalds, for example, is fried in oil. 

 From the french fries to the McChicken sandwich, all of the crispy foods are fried in oil that gets changed maybe once a day. 

 Although the crispy foods and the tenderness of chicken are appetizing to the senses, it is not healthy for anyone. A medium fry from McD’s has 440 calories, which is about 1/3 of anyone’s daily intake. 

 Food is put in a fryer, cooked for a few minutes, drained, and put into designated areas where it stays until an employee is ready to use it to make something. The greasy foods are put into trays and left to sit for about an hour or so until used up, otherwise they sit until used. 

 While the food is unhealthy, the environment inside a fast food chain is also sometimes “unhealthy.” 

 The point of a fast food chain is to order food quickly and get it even quicker. 

 A customer who sits and waits ten minutes before ordering is really annoying.  It is understandable if you cannot decide what to eat, but these menus have only a few options. There are not a million things to choose from. 

 Rude people are also part of a fast food restaurant. Yes, they are in a rush and stressed, but please do not take it out on the workers. 

 We try our hardest to get you the food you want in a timely manner. Before you come in and claim we got your order wrong, double-check the entire bag. 

 Do not just glance in it. Sometimes, you are just not seeing your item, even though it is there. 

 Fast food restaurants have their benefits: they are convieniet and quick. 

 However, a person must be careful of what they order. as some items are very unhealthy .

 Bill    Yes, of course most food at McDonalds and most other fast food places is not healthy. That said, you can still find some healthy food at most of these establishments if you try.
