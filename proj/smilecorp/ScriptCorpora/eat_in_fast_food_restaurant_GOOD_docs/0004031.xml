SALT LAKE CITY -- More than half of the Judge Memorial Catholic High School girls basketball team has been suspended from participating in their next two athletic competitions after they were caught drinking or had knowledge of drinking at the state tournament last weekend.
14 students in all have been placed on disciplinary contract by the school, meaning they have been put on probation for violating the schools code of conduct. If they are caught drinking or using drugs, they could be expelled.
The incident involving the girls basketball team occurred at the state tournament in Southern Utah. The girls had just lost their game and were back in their hotel room celebrating a birthday, when they were caught drinking during a room check.
Two of the girls were immediately turned over to their parents and were no longer allowed to participate in the rest of tournament. When the team got home and the incident was investigated further 12 others, including one male student, were disciplined for their various levels of involvement.
&quot;They&apos;ve been placed on contracts in the school, behavior contracts for not only this year, but all of next year,&quot; said Principal Rick Bartman. &quot;Again, that is to help them make good decisions and be able to say No, I&apos;m on contract. If I get randomly tested and I come up with anything in my system, I can be liable for expulsion.&quot;
Not all of the students disciplined were consuming alcohol in the hotel room, but because they had knowledge of it or were in proximity of it, they were in violation of the school&apos;s code of conduct.
Some parents have contacted the school upset about the disciplinary action, but the principal has said everyone who attends the private catholic school signs an agreement to uphold the policy.
&quot;We look at our student athletes as school leaders, we don&apos;t look at them any different than our academically gifted students because they could also be scholar athletes,&quot; Bartman said. &quot;Everybody is accountable for their behavior, whether it is a 14-year-old freshman, or 53-year-old principal.&quot;
The students involved will be randomly drug tested. They&apos;ll also have to sit out the next two games of whatever sport they next participate in. In addition, they will be required to meet with a certified drug and alcohol counselor who must clear them to play.
