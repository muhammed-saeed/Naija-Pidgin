		Factors That Influence 
 Food Choices 

 Healthteacher.com 

Food choices are influenced by many factors, age, gender, 
 friends, family, cultural background and where we live. 
 Although the main purpose of food is to nourish the body, food 
 means far more than that to many people. It can represent much 
 of who and what we are. People bond and foster relationships 
 around the dinner table and at celebrations with special meals 
 and foods, such as birthday cake. Some people express their 
 creative side by serving dinner guests, as well as expressing 
 their awareness and appreciation for others. Some people also 
 use food to help them cope with stress by overeating or 
 depriving themselves. Food may also be used as a reward for 
 accomplishing a specific goal. Consequently, what people eat 
 can reveal much about who they are socially, politically and 
 religiously.

Factors influencing food preferences include:

 Taste, texture and appearance. Economics - The cost of food affects what we eat. Our early experiences with food - Food 
 preferences begin early in life and change as we are exposed 
 to new people and places. As children, our choices were in 
 the hands of our parents. However, as we get older, our 
 experiences with new people and places increase, thereby 
 broadening our food preferences and choices. Habits - Most of what we eat from a particular 
 core group of foods. About one hundred items account for 75 
 percent of the foods most people eat. Having a narrow range 
 of food choices provides us with security. For example, 
 going to a particular fast-food restaurant provides common 
 expectations and experiences. Many people also have the 
 cooking habits of our mothers or grandmothers. Culture - Religious rules can affect food 
 choices. For example, Hindus do not eat beef, and some 
 Jewish people do not eat pork. The region that people are 
 from can also affect eating behaviors. Swedish people would 
 not eat an ear of corn, because it is considered food for 
 hogs. In the United States, we don&apos;t normally eat insects, 
 but many other cultures regard them as preferred foods. 
 Culture can also dictate the times to eat and what to eat at 
 certain meals. Advertising - To capture the interest of the 
 consumer, food producers spend billions of dollars each year 
 on advertising and packaging, both for food bought in 
 grocery stores and restaurants. The power of persuasion is 
 very strong, and so food producers and restaurants try to 
 make their products as appealing as possible to consumers, 
 even if that means making false claims. Social factors - Social changes have a big effect 
 on the food industry. Our fast-paced society demands 
 drive-through restaurants. Gas stations now have convenience 
 stores and restaurants attached to them, so people can do 
 one-stop shopping. Malls also cater to their customers with 
 food courts offering a wide variety of foods.
