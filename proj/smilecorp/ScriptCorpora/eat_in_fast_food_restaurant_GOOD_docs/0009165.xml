The last time I called in for takeout at Antojitos Mexicanos, I didn&apos;t even give my name. I just ordered the usual and when I went to pick it up, there was the bag with &quot;Sara&quot; written on the receipt.

Usually, I&apos;m not picking up the food, but meeting a friend for a regular lunch date. She tries various things, but I pretty much stick to my favorite: three azada tacos and a side of &quot;chips,&quot; which are actually full crispy corn tortillas that you break pieces off to dip into the salsa. If I&apos;m feeling like a luxury, I&apos;ll order a side of guacamole. On the very, very rare occasion I feel like something a little different, the pambazos are swoon-worthy. The pambazo is bean spread, shredded meat (I usually get pork) and very thin shredded cabbage on a bun that has been dipped in red sauce then toasted on the griddle. Messy but divine. Most of the time, if my lunch buddy is having a pambazo, she&apos;ll share a bite; then I get the best of both worlds.

Part of what makes the food at Antojitos so yummy, I think, is the salsas. The waitress comes over, setting seven little cups down in a line, hot to mild and one with limes. There&apos;s a green avocado-based one, thinner than guacamole, that&apos;s perfect on chips, and my favorite for the tacos is the deep red that sits at the top of the &quot;hot&quot; spectrum. They are all delicious. When I grab takeout, leftover salsa is wonderful on eggs the next morning.

Antojitos is a casual place. My usual three tacos and chips costs under $10 and the pambazo is about $6. Dinner isn&apos;t much more -- entrees between $10 and $20, less if you just want tacos without rice or beans. The ambiance isn&apos;t a dressed-up affair, nor is it the sterile plastic of the fast food restaurant the building used to house. Warm yellows and reds are reminiscent of Mexican architecture, and paintings of women with lilies adorn the walls. At lunch and dinner, tables are packed with people in business casual, friends meeting to catch up and families out for a tasty treat.
