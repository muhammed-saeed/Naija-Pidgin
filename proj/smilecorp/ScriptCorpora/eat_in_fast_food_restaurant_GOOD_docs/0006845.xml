Six Things That Attract Women
 
 

 This article: &quot;If there is no excuse, except for 
 yourself, for why you can&apos;t meet women, then it&apos;s time to turn things around 
 and fast. Here are six things that attract women and how you can control 
 these things.&quot; 

 Learning how to create attraction has to be the number 
 one reason why guys send in email questions. Because they just don’t get it. 
 And even when shown the open doorway to creating attraction they are too 
 scared to walk through. A lack of confidence in themselves is the reason why 
 many men fail. They fail at meeting women. They fail at great first 
 impressions. They fail at talking on the phone and yes, they even may get 
 that all important first date but they put themselves out on a shaky limb, 
 the girl instinctively feels his lack of confidence and she loses interest 
 in him faster than a snowflake melts in hell.

 For a guy to 
 be successful with women he has to be in control of six 
 things:
1. Means
2. Power
3. Fame
4. Looks
5. Exclusivity
6. Personality

 Now let’s break this down: 

 Means: how you can afford wealthy items, expensive 
 gifts for yourself and those around you. Can you afford 
 extravagance? If yes, then you hate the Means.

 Power: To have power you must be a leader with the ability 
 to lead people, not being a follower. You are decisive, in control 
 of events around you can provide safety for those in your crowd.

 Fame: You are well known outside of your own circle of 
 friends for an achievement of sorts.

 Looks: They way you look, being able to look great, stand tall (height is a 
 great part of your looks), dress sharply, cleanly.

 Exclusivity: Are you hard to get with because of a certain 
 affiliation, do you have a royal heritage (Prince Harry has no 
 problems with the girls, no matter what he does!), do you keep your 
 circle of friends tight around you that will require additional work 
 for someone to be able to meet you?

 Personality: Are you creative? Romantic? Funny? 
 Easily well liked? Do people walk across the room to hear you talk, 
 to be in your presence?

These six things that you need to be 
 in control of, which is the easiest for you to control in the next 
 20 minutes? Will you be richer in the next twenty minutes? Will you 
 gain power of people and events? Not likely! You won’t get better 
 looking, you won’t have people walking in your shadow trying to 
 catch up to you, you have no exclusivity! That leaves us with your 
 personality.

Your personality is the one main thing you can control in any 
 situation, with anyone, in any place. Your personality can shine, 
 sparkle, tease and seduce.

When you can instantly make 
 yourself likeable, friend-ready, dateable and even inspiring, it’s 
 due to a magnetic personality.

It is true that people only 
 see what they want to see. And women in particular are looking for a 
 guy that exudes confidence, is funny and has personality.

When you can talk and be heard, when people cross the room to talk 
 to you, to introduce themselves to you, you are magnetic.

And where can you learn the magic aspects of personality?

My ebook, Double Your Dating is all about personality and becoming 
 ‘cocky and funny’ with women that creates instant, undeniable 
 attraction.

 Let’s take a letter from someone that has read the 
 ebook and applied the personality concept to himself with successful 
 results:

***SUCCESS STORY***

 Dear David, 
Like magic, the use of your advice worked!

Not just one bit 
 of advice like a magic bullet though, it is the combination of all 
 your strategies, techniques and process understanding. It is 
 important to get your book, read your email updates and really&quot;get 
 it&quot;. I can&apos;t imagine what would happen if I came to your seminars, I 
 would probably be dating the next in line for Queen of England. So I 
 read all the books you recommended to work on my&quot;inner game&quot;Very 
 important and intelligent of you to figure all this out. I never 
 could have done it on my own. You have got my ASM (Automatic Success 
 Mechanism) as per Maxwell Maltz going so extreme that most times I 
 don&apos;t even need to make the first move attractive women notice me 
 now. Okay let me give you and example of what I am talking about.

I just walked into a fast food restaurant and noticed a tall, 
 striking blonde (at least a 9.5) who bent over backwards to make 
 sure my order was perfect even took my cash up to the register for 
 me. Well after all that extra attention I thought it must be time to 
 say something, especially after all the&quot;Dave Work&quot;I have been 
 doing. I wanted to say:&quot;You must be an actress or a model&quot;because 
 she is so beautiful, but only a Wuss would say something like that. 
 ASM from my sub-conscience kicked in and I laid back and then 
 casually said&quot;this is a fast-paced environment, do you like it?&quot;

Dave, she began telling me some of the most interesting things. 
 To my surprise, I had to cut her off and then I just merely said&quot;Do 
 you have email?&quot;She said wait a minute I&apos;ll give you one of my 
 cards. She left the very busy floor went to the employee break room 
 (I guess) or her car and returned with a business card that she 
 wrote her email address on the back. She then walked me partially to 
 the door, shook my hand and wished me good luck.

Dave, if 
 I wouldn&apos;t have read your stuff I would have stayed there, ordered 
 another coke, seemed needy by just hanging out and like I didn&apos;t 
 have a life. Her Wuss detector would have wrote me off immediately. 
 Meeting a beautiful woman was the last thing on my mind but the aura 
 I must have now and the abilities I now have are thanks to you. 
 Actually, I intend to master your stuff.

Who knows maybe 
 the Royalty circuit is just waiting for me? I set a goal three weeks 
 ago of dating 4-5 women in six months. Well it’s been three weeks of 
 studying&quot;Dave Stuff&quot;and I already got three new woman in my life 
 and if this one works out that will be four! Plus, since I am not as 
 needy I&apos;ve got three old girlfriends calling, emailing and sending 
 gifts like never before. Gee, if I ever get time to actually go out 
 and look for women, like at a night club or sporting event, I can&apos;t 
 imagine what will happen.

I even got two women on email that are going to fly cross 
 country at their expense to meet me and stay for the weekend. One 
 just got a boob job and wants me to be the first to see and touch 
 her new additions and the other is going to work overtime for three 
 weeks just to pay for the tickets! There is not much more of a 
 powerful testimonial to show how effective your advice actually 
 works for meeting women over the internet.
Sincere thanks
John, L. from Denver

 David D&apos;s Reply 

The Queen of England?
Dude, she&apos;s not that hot.

Isn&apos;t it AMAZING how differently 
 women respond when you begin to understand and communicate with them 
 in this way?

And the internet is SUCH a great place to 
 apply what you&apos;re learning and PRACTICE as well. I learned a lot by 
 chatting with women on instant messaging services, etc.

In 
 fact, if it wasn&apos;t for the internet and being able to practice in 
 this way, it would have taken me a LOT longer to figure out a lot of 
 the things that I now use and teach.

And of all the 
 places to REALLY STAND OUT... when you respond to a woman&apos;s personal 
 ad with a great Cocky&amp;Funny note, it&apos;s like a breath of fresh air. 
 Or when you IM a woman and say&quot;It says here that you&apos;re an actress. 
 What, you couldn&apos;t get a real job?&quot;

It sets you apart 
 INSTANTLY from all the loser guys who are saying&quot;Hi, you&apos;re really 
 pretty. Can I take you out on a date?&quot;

I like your ideas 
 about incorporating self help and personal development into your 
 routine. I&apos;ve read a lot of great self help books, and they have 
 helped me to deal with my&quot;personal stuff&quot;and feel more comfortable 
 in my own skin in general.

Great job, and congratulations 
 on your success.

 ****End of letter**** 

 This success 
 is not limited to the guys that have control of the first 
 five thing we talked about that attract women. It’s all about 
 personality and how you can manage yourself. You’ll notice as well 
 that once your personality does make you a attractive person, the 
 first five things either fall into place or are overcome by your 
 personality in a great way.

 I have gotten a lot of 
 feedback from guys saying things like&quot;This stuff has 
 completely changed the way I think about women&quot;and&quot;Now when I 
 interact with women, I&apos;m the one in control because I understand 
 what&apos;s going on in their minds&quot;etc.
 
 As men, I think that most of our programming is 
 backwards when it comes to women and dating. And if you want to 
 learn how to think forwards and get the kinds of results that most 
 men will only dream of all their lives, then I recommend that you 
 check out my ebook.

 I know that information contained in it will improve your dating success just like it&apos;s 
 improved mine.

It&apos;s the foundation for everything that I 
 teach in these articles, and it will make everything work better for 
 you. It&apos;s here 
Just follow the&apos;ebook&apos;link and download your copy. This book and 
 the three bonus ebooks (Bridges, Lover and Provider, Sex Secrets) 
 that come with it are the FOUNDATION for success with women. 
 Everything you read in these articles will make more sense once you 
 have read the book .

 ...and read it, learn it, and use it. 
David D.
{You&apos;ll even learn&apos; The 
 Kiss Test &apos;, when and how to get the first kiss with the woman you&apos;re 
 with.}
