 Registered User Join Date Jun 2006 Location Indianapolis Posts 1,171 Here is an article explaining the&quot;mother&quot;part. I have some of the Bragg brand and it is brown looking and cloudy, but that is a good thing! Another good article can be found at http://www.bragg.com/FAQ/faq_applecider.html 

 INTRODUCTION TO THE POWERFUL HEALTH QUALITIES
OF NATURAL APPLE CIDER VINEGAR:
APPLE CIDER VINEGAR MIRACLE HEALTH SYSTEM, HOW TO USE THE POWERFUL HEALTH QUALITIES OF NATURAL APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
by Dr. Patricia Bragg

Excerpts from Pages 1-4:


Research worldwide supports and commends what Hippocrates (the father of medicine) found and treated his patients with in 400 B.C. He discovered that natural, undistilled Apple Cider Vinegar (or ACV)* is a powerful cleansing and healing elixir a naturally occurring antibiotic and antiseptic that fights germs and bacteria for a healthier, stronger, longer life!

The versatility of ACV as a powerful body cleansing agent is legendary. Its been traced to Egyptian urns as far back as 3000 B.C. The Babylonians used it as a condiment and preservative, while Julius Caesars army used ACV tonic to stay healthy and fight off disease. The Greeks and Romans kept vinegar vessels for healing and flavoring. It was used in Biblical times as an antiseptic and a healing agent and is mentioned in the Bible. In Paris in the Middle Ages it was sold from barrels by street vendors as a body deodorant, healing tonic and a health vinegar drink.

Even Christopher Columbus and his crew on his voyage to discover America in 1492 had their vinegar barrels for prevention of scurvy as did the soldiers in the American Civil War. For centuries in Japan, the feared Samurai warriors drank it for strength and power. ACV has been used for thousands of years not only for health reasons, but also as a cleansing agent to remove bacteria, germs, odors, and even stains and spots.

* The best is the Organic, Raw, Unfiltered, Unpasteurized Apple Cider Vinegar with the&quot;mother,&quot;available most Health Stores.


ACV MOTHER NATURE&apos;S PERFECT FOOD
Natural (undistilled) organic, raw ACV can really be called one of Mother Nature&apos;s most perfect foods. It is made from fresh, crushed apples which are then allowed to mature naturally in wooden barrels, as wood seems to&quot;boost&quot;the natural fermentation. Natural ACV should be rich, brownish color and if held to the light you might see a tiny formation of&quot;cobweb-like&quot;substances that we call the&quot;mother.&quot;Usually some&quot;mother&quot;will show in the bottom of the ACV bottle the more it ages. It never needs refrigeration. You can also save some&quot;mother&quot;and transfer it to work in other natural vinegars. When you smell natural ACV, there&apos;s a pungent odor and sometimes it&apos;s so ripened it puckers your mouth and smarts your eyes these are natural, good signs.

WHY HAS NATURAL APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DISAPPEARED FROM GROCERS&apos; SHELVES?
The blame for the disappearance of natural raw Apple Cider Vinegar from supermarkets lies on the shoulders of the general public, as well as the producers of vinegar.

Most people buy food with their eyes, not thinking of good nutrition. The vinegar producers failed to enlighten the public on what powerful health qualities were locked within natural ACV. Why? Because most of them had not the slightest knowledge of the health values of natural, raw, organic, unfiltered, cloudy (and to some, less attractive-looking) Apple Cider Vinegar with the&quot;mother.&quot;They produced pasteurized, refined and distilled vinegars because the public demanded the clear look. It was simply filling current supply and demand.

POWERFUL HEALTH QUALITIES REMOVED
You cannot completely blame the producers of vinegar. They are not nutritionists, nor are they biochemists. Their business is to give the customers what they want. Most people purchase vinegar for flavoring, also for pickling and marinating their foods. Some women use it to rinse their hair after shampooing, as it leaves it squeaky clean, softer and much easier to manage.

ACV is also a germ fighter in the home, lab, etc. Some mix it with water to wash windows, as it removes sludge and keeps them sparkling clean. ACV has hundreds of uses and its versatility is legendary as a powerful household cleansing and deodorizing agent free of dangerous chemicals.


ACV HAS POWERFUL HEALTH QUALITIES
Both the general public and the producers of vinegar have been informed as to the powerful health qualities of organic, raw, unfiltered, fully ripened ACV. Ignorance isn&apos;t always bliss! When most people see natural apple cider vinegar with the brownish color and the tiny, cobweb&quot;mother&quot;floating in it, they think it looks unappetizing. The general public has been educated and brainwashed to want everything they purchase to have perfect eye appeal!

To meet this demand that vinegar must be clear, light colored and free from the brownish, cobweb&quot;mother&quot;is the reason producers distill their vinegar. In distilling, the vinegar is turned to steam by heating. Therefore it destroys the powerful enzymes and distills out the life-giving minerals such as potassium, phosphorus, natural organic fluorine, silicon, trace minerals and pectin as well as many other powerful nutrients! Distilling also destroys the natural malic and tartaric acids which are important in fighting body toxins and inhibiting unfriendly bacteria.

You can see how the public, with their obsession for eye appeal foods, reacts. The producers of Apple Cider Vinegar, who agreed to sell their product for a profit, put a&quot;death warrant&quot;against healthy, organic, raw, fully ripened ACV. The public got what they wanted a clear, appealing, but dead ACV. When natural ACV was hard to find, other strange vinegars began to appear on grocery shelves. The first was malt vinegar, a refined vinegar. It&apos;s clear and acceptable to the public. It tastes like vinegar, but has none of the healing qualities of natural, raw ACV.

COMMERCIAL VINEGARS ARE REAL TRAGEDIES
Then came the real tragedy: a food chemist produced an imitation vinegar from coal tar! It looked clean, white and tasted like vinegar. Today it&apos;s the most popular vinegar in supermarkets. It&apos;s cheaper than distilled vinegar or malt vinegar. Most people buy these worthless vinegars. there&apos;s nothing good about commercial vinegars, except they look clean and taste like vinegar. They have no health value! They don&apos;t contain the health values of organic, raw ACV with the mother. Millions worldwide never get the health benefits of this natural ACV as Hippocrates used in 400 B.C.

ACV HELPS STIFFNESS VANISH FROM BODY
You will find, after several months of the ACV and honey cocktail taken 3 times daily that the stiffness and misery will be gone from your joints and body. You will discover you can walk or run up several flights of stairs without any effort and pain! You will notice that you look and feel younger!

Make The Bragg Healthy Lifestyle a life-long daily habit! Over the years we have seen many stiff-jointed, prematurely old people transform themselves into new, youthful, healthy people! We can&apos;t do it for you. You must make the effort to give this ACV and honey program a chance to prove what it can do for you!

QUESTION ABOUT APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
Many people have some preconceived idea that Apple Cider Vinegar is harmful to the body, Instead it&apos;s the distilled, pasteurized, filtered, the malt and synthetic dead vinegars that must be avoided for human consumption!

Let us assure you that there is nothing in this wonderful, organic, raw ACV that can in any way harm your body! People ask us about the merits and benefits of ACV. See the inside front cover for a list of some of the miracles it can perform.

Animal proteins and fats have a tendency to thicken the blood, while natural acids and enzymes in ACV help to keep the blood healthier and thinner. Also, that&apos;s why people naturally crave and serve cranberry sauce (which contains four different natural acids) with turkey and fowl. They serve applesauce with roast pork dishes, a slice of lemon with fish, or steak with mushrooms - all rich in natural acids. Last edited by Kayray; 04-08-2007 at 06:12 AM .

Many commercial apple cider vinegars have been pasteurized, filtered, refined or distilled ..... this extra processing destroys much of the healthy goodness and thus many of the apple cider benefits that were in the product in the first place.

The best type of apple cider vinegar to use is one made from cold pressed, organically grown whole apples, in which no chemicals or preservatives have been added, which contains the&quot;mother of vinegar&quot;, and is not pasteurized. The&quot;mother of vinegar&quot;is a natural gelatinous substance formed during the last fermentation step.
This type of wholesome apple cider vinegar can be readily found in most health food stores and even in some general grocery stores.

.... you can brew your own nutritious apple cider vinegar at home.
