A SELECTION OF 

STORIES AND LITERARY SKETCHES 

From &quot;THE BULLETIN&quot; 
C1881— 1901] 




SYDNEY: MCMI 

THE BULLETIN NEWSPAPER COMPANY. LIMITED 

PUBLISHERS 



Prefatory 



THE files of The Bulletin for twenty years offer so much material for a book 
such as this, that it was not possible to include more than a small 
number of the stories and literary sketches judged worthy of republication. 
Consequently many excellent Australasian writers are here unrepresented, 
their work being perforce held over for The Second Bulletin Story Book, although 
it is work of a quality equal to that which is now given. 

The risk and expense of this publication are undertaken by The Bulletin 
Newspaper Company, Limited. Should any profits accrue, a share of forty 
per cent, will be credited to the writers represented. 

Owing to the length of time which, in some cases, has elapsed since the 
original publication in The Bulletin, the names and addresses of some of the 
writers have been lost sight of ; and their work appears over pen-names. 
The editor will be glad if these writers will communicate with him and assist in 
completing the Biographical Index at the end of the book. Any suggestions 
for revision or improvement of the stories or of the book will be gratefully 
received. 

The Bulletin Story Book is copyrighted by the Bulletin Newspaper Company, 
Limited ; and the contents must not be reprinted without the permission of the 
pr6prietors.

troductory 



IN collating these stories and literary sketches from the files of The Bulletin, 
the aim has been to make an interesting book. It has not been 
attempted to choose the best examples of literary style. Judged by a high 
canon, our most talented story-writers are still only clever students of the art 

■of writing. A mere two or three have been able to earn a living by the 
jprofession of literature, and even these have been obliged to make the perilous 
compromise with journalism. So the stories and sketches which follow are 
usually the literary dreams of men of action, or the literary realisation of 
things seen by wanderers. Usually they are objective, episodic, detached — 

•branches torn from the Tree of Life, trimmed and dressed with whatever skill 
the writers possess (which often is not inconsiderable). In most of them still 
throbs the keen vitality of the parent stem : many are absolute transcripts of 
the Fact, copied as faithfully as the resources of language will permit. Hence 
many of them, remaining level with Nature, remain on the lower plane of 
Art — which at its highest is not imitative, but creative, — making anew the 
whole world in terms of its subject. What is desiderated is that these isolated 
impressions should be fused in consciousness, and re-visualised, re-presented 
with their universal reference made clear — yes 1 with the despised Moral, but 
with a moral which shines forth as an essence, is not stated as an after-thought. 
In other words, the branch should be shown growing upon the Tree, not severed 
from it : the Part should imply the Whole, and in a sense contain it, defying 
mathematics. Every story of a man or woman should be a microcosm of 
humanity ; every vision of Nature should hold an imagination of the Universe. 
These be counsels of perfection which it is easier to teach than to practise, 
though many writers in other lands have practised them. So we take the 
good the gods provide, and are properly grateful, while striving for better and 
best. 

Further, in this book it has not been attempted to choose examples of 
work characteristically Australian. The literary work which is Australian in 
spirit, as well as in scene or incident, is only beginning to be written. The 
formal establishment of the Commonwealth has not yet crystallised the floating 
elements of national- life. Australia is still a suburb of Cosmopolis, where

vi. THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

men from many lands perpetuate in a new environment the ideas and habits 
acquired far away. Our children bow instinctively to the fetishes of their 
fathers, for the heredity of centuries is not eliminated in a generation, or in 
half-a-dozen generations. Only here and there we receive hints and portents of 
the Future. Australian Nationality to-day is like an alchemist&apos;s crucible just 
before the gold-birth, with red fumes rising, and strange odours, and a dazzling 
gleam caught by moments through the bubble and seethe. Yet, without 
a deliberate choice, a few examples of Australian work — of work which 
could not have been conceived or written anywhere but in Australia — have 
naturally included themselves in the following pages. These are often sad 
or tragic : because, first, the fierce intensity of Tragedy makes more poignant, 
profounder literature than Comedy can make ; because, second, our pioneering 
stage of civilisation is necessarily a stage of hard struggle, often of individual 
defeat, and the shadow of Tragedy lowers heavily over men who are fighting 
in a doubtful battle. Yet there are not wanting adumbrations of the Beauty 
of Australia, — glimpses of the secret enchantment in which this strange, 
feline land — half-fierce, half-caressing — holds those who have listened to the 
gum-trees&apos; whispered spells or drunk the magic philter of landscapes flooded 
with Nature&apos;s opiate-tints. 

Verlaine&apos;s cult of Faded Things, extolling the hinted hue before the 
gross colour, finds a natural home in Australia, — in many aspects a 
Land of Faded Things — of delicate purples, delicious greys, and dull, dreamy 
olives and ochres. Yet we have been content to let strangers foist upon 
us the English ideals of glaring green or staring red and orange ; we have 
permitted them to denounce our grave harmonies of rock and vegetation, 
with shadow laid on tender shadow, light on dusky light. This, though the 
chief English art-magazine passes by all the English emeralds and flaunting 
autumn tints to bind itself in dull Australian green ! This, though intelligent 
Englishmen themselves revolt against their tradition of crude colouring, and 
declare, like returning Morley Roberts, that &quot; there was one thing that struck 
me in England as very strange, not to say painful, and that was the vivid colour 
of the pastures. We are quite proud of our perpetual verdure ; but, to tell the 
truth, the tint of the grass after the soberer dull greys and greens and browns 
of Australia was extremely unpleasant to my eye. I thought the colour glaring, 
not to say inartistic ; it certainly was not unnatural, and yet it struck me as 
being as nearly that as if someone had deliberately painted the fields. It 
took me months to get reconciled to it.&quot; 

And the typical English beauty often looks as painted as the fields, with 
her coarse contrast of carmine and white ; yet we permit Englishmen to come 
here and decry the divine pallor of Australians ruddied like a capricious coral I 




INTRODUCTORY. yii 

Englishmen have been permitted even to denounce the gum-tree, the most 
picturesque tree that grows, always at ease and unconventional. To see the 
many-bosomed gum-tree moving in a breeze (that gum-tree shaped like a 
soaring parachute made of a score of minor parachutes which lift and strain 
as if eager to be off and up) ; to watch the shifting interspaces of sky when 
amber days or purple nights play hide-and-seek among the wayward branches, 
and to listen to the birdlike murmur of the leaves, almost a twittering ;— this 
is to receive an aesthetic education. Yet Englishmen persist in bringing 
hither their dense, sombre trees which defy even an Australian sun-ray, which 
almost disdain to ruffle in an Australian breeze — trees with the heavy 
magnificence of an English dinner, and often as dull ; — and they call upon us 
to admire these unnatural exotics ! Englishman Marcus Clarke has even 
called our gum-tree &quot;melancholy,&quot; our forests &quot;funereal.&quot; He knew 
nothing of this country beyond Victoria and Tasmania ; but he multiplied a 
Wimmera station by the literary imagination and called the product Australia 
— actually winning quasi-Australian praise for the misrepresentation I 

The grotesque English prejudice against things Australian, founded on no 
better reason than that they are unlike English things, still remains to vitiate the 
local sense of local beauty ; but every year Is teaching us wisdom. We have 
learnt to laugh at the ridiculous and reiterated fiction that our flowers have no 
scent and our birds no song. Why, the whole Bush is scented ; in no land is 
there a greater wealth of aromatic perfume from tree and shrub and blossom — 
making the daisied meadows of England, as honest Henry Kingsley suggests, 
tame and suburban by comparison. And when you go up beyond the tropic- 
line, and walk out of your tent at dawn, the air in many places is literally 
weighed down with the fragrance of a hundred brilliant flowers. What would 
they not give in England for ten acres of wattle-blossom on Wimbledon 
Common ? and how many nightingales would they exchange for a flight of 
crimson lories at sunset? — a shower of flaming rubies. Did Marcus Clarke 
never hear the fluting of an Australian magpie ? — so mellow, so round, so sweet. 
If the little brown English birds sing better than our vari-plumaged parrakeets, 
is not the strife at least equal ? Does not fine colour yield as much pleasure 
to the artist eye as fine song to the artist ear ? When will Englified city 
critics realise that Australia is a country which extends through forty 
degrees of latitude and thirty-five of longitude, and comprehends all climates, 
all scenery— snow-capped mountain and torrid desert, placid lake and winding 
river, torrent and brook, charm as well as grandeur, garden and homely 
field as well as barren solitude ? 

It is heredity and custom which again betray us. The rose is a beautiful 
flower, but the most beautiful only because thousands of years of care and 



viii. THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

cultivation have been lavished to bring it to perfection, because thousands of 
lovers have breathed its perfume, thousands of poets have apostrophised its 
exquisite form. Give the same care and cultivation to a hundred modest bush 
flowers, draw them from obscurity as the rose has been drawn from the parent 
wilderness, let them be worshipped and adored through centuries of sentiment 
— and we have here the rivals of the rose herself. Cluster the associations of 
the oak and yew around the yarran or the cedar (all the cedars of Lebanon 
were not more stately than those of the Herberton scrub), and the oak andyev/ 
will shrink, not indeed into insignificance, but into their proper proportion as 
regarded from Australia. In a word, let us look at our country and its fauna 
and flora, its trees and streams and mountains, through clear Australian eyes, 
not through bias-bleared English spectacles ; and there is no more beautiful 
country in the world. 

It will be the fault of the writers, not of the land, if Australian literature 
does not by-and-by become memorable. In the field of the short sketch or 
story, for example, — the field which includes this book, — what country can 
offer to writers better material than Australia ? We are not yet snug in 
cities and hamlets, moulded by routine, regimented to a pattern. Every 
man who roams the Australian wilderness is a potential knight of Romance ; 
every man who grapples with the Australian desert for a livelihood might 
sing a Homeric chant of victory, or listen, baffled and beaten, to any^schylean 
dirge of defeat. The marvels of the adventurous are our daily common- 
places. The drama of the conflict between Man and Destiny is played 
here in a scenic setting whose novelty is full of vital suggestion for the 
literary artist. In the twilit labour of the timber-getter in a Richmond 
scrub ; in the spectacle of the Westralian prospector tramping across his 
mirage-haunted waste ; in the tropic glimpse of the Thursday Island pearling 
fleet, manned by men of a dozen turbulent races, — the luggers floating so 
calmly above a search so furious ; — here, and in a hundred places beside, 
there is wealth of novel inspiration for the writers who will live Australia&apos;s 
life and utter her message. And when those writers come, let us tell them that 
we will never rest contented until Australian authors reach the highest 
standards set in literature, in order that we may set the standards higher and 
preach discontent anew.

THE PROCESSION OF EGOS. 

ON each side of him, for many a mile, extended a pebbled 
beach shut in by hazy headlands. The quiet sea chafed 
gently at his feet on a myriad little stones — once hugest 
boulders, now worn by unwearied Time into minute and most 
diverse shapes. 

He stooped and separated one stone from its fellows — it was 
so very circular. It was somewhat flat ; about the size of a 
small coin. 

Chance has formed this little pebble so, he thought. Then , , 
what Chance ? 

The Philosopher put the little stone disc in his pocket and 
walked home, considering deeply. He went at once to his 
laboratory and measured the granite fragment with his most 
delicate instruments. To their mechanism, capable of discriminating 
to a thousandth part of an inch, the circle of the thing was round, 
try it which way he would — round absolutely. The Philosopher was 
disturbed. 

He leaned his head upon his hands, with his eyes fixed upon 
the insignificant pebble placed on the table before him. 

&quot;It seems to me,&quot; he mused, &quot;it is no mere speculation. It is 
a certainty — it must be. Yet I will place the argument on paper 
so that no error may creep in.&quot; 

He was trembling as he took a pen and wrote : 

&quot; The conception of Space necessarily insists upon an infinity 
of Space. If Space be not infinite, it must have a boundary. 
But if that boundary be not infinite, itself must have a boundary, 
and so on — to infinity. 



-2 -...,:: THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

;.&apos;•,&apos;** And for -simiJar reasons, the conception of Time implies an 
infinity of TiiineV 

&quot; Therefore the material Universe — what we call Matter — 
occurs in an infinity of Space and Time. 

&quot;But if Space and Time be infinite, why not Matter? The 
infinite repetition of Matter is at least as likely as its sudden 
cessation. So far as human knowledge extends. Matter is infinitely 
repeated. 

&quot; And, so far as human knowledge extends, Matter is identical 
in essence. There is at least as much likelihood that its primal 
elements will remain the same as there is that they will change to 
something inconceivably different. 

&quot; This Matter must be held or governed by a condition of its 
own existence — since Space and Time are abstractions. 

*&apos; And as Matter is identical, the Law which governs it must 
also be identical. 

&quot; This pebble in all its remarkable rotundity was formed by 
what we call Chance, which in its last analysis is only an expression 
of Law, and is certain and entirely inflexible. 

&quot; Given Sea, and Stone, and Time long enough, a shape such as 
this must have been formed. 

&quot; And if this shape, in the chances which Time never-ending 
must bring, then every and any other shape. 

&quot; But Time is not operating in its chances on this World alone, 
but on all other Worlds which it has formed, extending in Space 
inimitably. 

&quot; Therefore other discs the very counterpart of this must exist 
in other Worlds. 

&quot; And, the Worlds being unlimited in number, the perfect discs 
must be unlimited. 

&quot; But Chance must repeat the shape and characteristics of this 
World as it repeats the discs. 

&quot;And, as the Worlds are unlimited, and Time has never 
begun nor yet can end, some World must be so like that the 
similarity will extend to every islet, to every rock, to every

pebble, and to that pebble&apos;s exact position on the sea-beach as I 
found this. 

&quot; Chance, then, in its infinite variety, must at this moment 
hold sway over a World which is in everything the precise replica 
of this World — with like human beings, like laws, customs, 
languages, and religions — like to the tiniest grain of sand, and 
to the most transient thought flickering through a brain — a perfect 
identity. 

&quot; There must be therefore a Man like me — of my name — of my 
past — a Man who is now writing — who is now thinking what I am

&quot; But, as there is a limitless series of Worlds subject to Chance, 
there must be a limitless series of Worlds such as this.

He broke off here — the room seemed so small and its confines 
so insupportable. He went out into the night wind, which 
enveloped him with its grateful chill. 

A swart cloud hung sullen under the face of the moon. 
Before him crouched in the darkness an undefined mass. It 
was a rugged hill, strewn with rocks and smoothed boulders. He 
gained the summit, and bared his head to the stronger breeze. The 
cloud had moved and no longer prevented the moon&apos;s light. 

And the Philosopher now for the first time became aware of a 
rhythmic murmur — not loud and thundering, but enormous in 
its pervasiveness. Tramp / — it sounded . . . tramp / . . . 
tramp / . . . 

He looked at the landscape below and saw at first dimly, 
then quite distinctly, an expanse of people. It was the noise of 
their walking he had heard as they marched past the hill with 
measured and unhurried step. They entirely filled the view, save 
on the side on which he stood, and they rolled on as a sea that rolls 
to meet a sea. 



4 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Looking still more intently, the Philosopher perceived with a 
terror, the like of which he had never imagined before, that every 
man of the crowd was a likeness of himself dreadful in its 
exactness. 

Yet they paid no sort of attention to him, but continued their 
sombre way. 

Impelled by a strange curiosity, he shouted to them : 

** Where do I come from ? &quot; 

He had intended to say — &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot; but in 
some inexplicable way, and in spite of himself, he was compelled to 
say &quot; I &quot; instead of &quot; you.&quot; 

Then all who marched below, to the most remote of them, 
turned their heads backwards and peered at him with contracted 
brows, and peered most curiously, and said together in one great 
voice, enquiringly, yet somewhat sadly withal : 

&quot; Where do I come from ? &quot; 

Then he asked again, being again impelled to say &quot; I &quot; instead 
of &quot; you &quot; : 

« How far do I extend ? &quot; 

And all the men who marched below suddenly raised them- 
selves a-tip-toe to look over one another&apos;s head, and answered 
blankly : 

&quot; How far do I extend ? &quot; 

And once more, notwithstanding his fear, he asked a further 
question, not this time essaying to speak the word &quot; you,&quot; for it was 
impossible : 

&quot; Where am I going ? &quot; 

And at this question all the landscape of faces with the moon- 
light on them turned towards him, and looked at him with frightful 
mockery, and answered : 

&quot; Where am I going 1 &quot; 

But the sound of their voice was so loud and pervading that 
the hill on which he stood quivered to its rooted depths. Its cliffs 
rose from the earth and flung themselves headlong down sheer 
steeps. Massy stones, lying squat, starred and split to their bellied 



THE PROCESSION OF EGOS. 5 

The rounded granite pebbles crumbled into dust. The 
moon herself, serenest of spheres, darkened her ray and trembled in 
her silver chains ; and the stars sparkled fitfully and sought 
vainly to forsake their customed paths. Nor was the sound unfelt 
by the nether and piled universes for ever. 

He hastened down the quaking hillside and joined the infinite 
throng.

A ROW IN OUR BOARDING-HOUSE. 

THE trouble began on the night when a newly-imported British 
youth named Johnson appeared at our boarding-house. 

There were ten of us there before his arrival, including Bem, 
the Polish tailor, who was vaguely understood to have thrown 
bombs at all the royal families of Europe, and then gone into exile. 
We paid seventeen shillings a week each, not including washing ; 
and we lived riotously on boiled mutton. There were more empty 
beer-bottles in the bedrooms, and more laughter, and more grease 
slopped on the floor, and the candle-ends got into the soup oftener 
in that boarding-house than in any other I ever heard of. Also, 
the neighbours got less sleep than anybody ever did in the vicinity of 
any other boarding-house. The dining-room had not been papered 
since the beginning of history, and the landlady had only one eye j 
also, her daughter had recently eloped with a non-union printer. 
She, the landlady, was aged about 40, and wore a green dress, and in 
the evenings she used to sing songs to us with her hair down. 
These few details will convey a reasonably good idea of the nature 
of that wild Bohemian establishment. 

One windy evening in March, the landlady had agitated the 
bell on the stairs, as was her custom. Her weapon was a sort of 
cowbell, and when she wrestled with it on the murky staircase she 
looked like a witch dancing on a heath. Her arms, her hair, her 
feet, her green dress, her trodden-down shoes flew in eight difierent 
directions, and her one eye and the bell flew in two more. Strangers 
coming down in the dark, and meeting this apparition suddenly, 
generally took her for a heap of boa-constrictor, or an immense 
octopus leaping on the top step. Poor old agitated female — she is 
dead now. She broke her neck in the passage one day, rushing

[own to look at a funeral. But if she had kept on ringing that 
dinner-bell she would have been immortal. Death could n&apos;t have 
aimed straight enough to hit her in her gambols. 

I rushed down to the dining-room at the first signal, and, 
meeting Bem and two more coming tumultuously in the opposite 
direction, we got jammed in the doorway. I was just going to pass 
some uncomplimentary observations when we all caught sight of a 
spectacle such as the oldest individual in that boarding-house had 
never seen before. A great calm descended upon us, and we 
disentangled ourselves and went in silently. 

What I saw was an object like a naked infant&apos;s hind-leg, 
resting in a careless, graceful attitude against a chair. There was 
a bracelet on it, and attached to one end of it was a woman. She 
was attired in a silk dress which exposed her right down to the 
fifth knob of her spine, or thereabouts, and she had a necklace, and 
an eye-glass, and sundry rings. There was a frozen expression in 
her eye — a look of cold derision that seemed to fall like a curse 
upon the whole company. This was Johnson&apos;s wife. Johnson him- 
self was there, in a tail-coat, and a tremendous collar, and another 
eye-glass, and he had a silver bangle on his wrist. He was the first 
male human being that I ever saw inside a bangle, and I am 
prepared to swear that he was the very first who ever wore a bangle 
in a boarding-house. 

Between them they made just one remark all dinner-time. It 
was &quot; Haw ! &quot; I could have said the same thing myself if I had 
been dead. 

We did not eat much that evening, and there was very little 
conversation. We were all paralysed by the spectacle of Johnson 
and his wife. They kept looking round the table in a pensive, 
perplexed sort of way, as if they were searching for some of the 
commonest necessaries of life, such as were to be found in stacks in 
their ancestral castle ; and then they would wake up as from a 
dream, and recollect suddenly that they were castaways in a savage 
land where the wild aborigines never heard of the article, whatever 
it might be. And when they were finished the lady went and

smote the piano with an arm of might for about 38 minutes, after 
which the pair retired and were seen no more that night. 

That was the beginning of the row in our boarding-house. 

Next morning the owner of the establishment came down 
early and refreshed herself with a few melodies before breakfast. 
She was a strange, promiscuous, half -savage female, and was wont at 
times to get up before daybreak, and thud out all manner of lost 
chords on the keyboard, and then she would keep time with her 
slippers and her head, and whirl her tangled locks in the air, and 
cast the tails of her dressing-gown out behind her in a frenzy of 
inspiration. After that she would scuttle away with a prodigious 
clatter, and clutch the sausages that were to be fried for breakfast, 
and for about half-an-hour the air would be darkened with a chaos 
of food and dishes, and it would blow a gale of gravy, cruets, loaves, 
and similar properties. When she entered with the breakfast-tray 
it always made me think of Napoleon&apos;s commissariat-department 
flying from Moscow, for she generally arrived at a gallop, shoving 
one-half the provisions in front of her and dragging the other half 
behind, and hissing to scare off the cat, which ran with its tail up 
in the rear of the procession, trying vainly to claw at the alleged 
eatables. 

Then she would fling herself on the bell like a hash-house 
keeper possessed, and make a riot that was calculated to wake the 
lost souls of all the dead boarders who had shuffled off this mortal 
coil, and were eating spectral ham and eggs in the fields of asphodel. 
On this morning I found her leaping and gambolling on the stairs 
as usual, and I stopped to propound a solemn question. 

&quot; Mrs. Jones,&quot; I said sternly, &quot; who are the partially-dressed 
intruder in the bed-furniture, and the tailor&apos;s advertisement with 
the jewellery on his fore-leg ? &quot; 

&quot;He&apos;s in the Gas-Office !&quot; she replied in gasps, as she threw 
herself up against the air with the bell. &quot; Newly-married ! He &apos;s 
English, and got £80 a year! I took them in at a reduced 
rate I&quot; 



A BOW IN OUR BOARDING-HOUSE. 9 

&quot; Oh, you did ! Now, look here ; have you any reason to 

ri^ppose he &apos;s a duke or an emperor, or anything of the sort ? &quot; 
I &quot;No!&quot; 

&quot; Do you suppose, as a respectable Christian woman, that he &apos;s 
got a castle anywhere ? &quot; 

* No, I don&apos;t s&apos;pose he has.&quot; 
&quot; Did he come in with the Conqueror, now ? &quot; 
&quot; There was n&apos;t anybody with him when he came in, that 
I saw.&quot; 

&quot;And did you know when you took them in that she was 
going to stick so far out of her clothes ? &quot; 

&quot; No, I DID n&apos;t. If I &apos;d knowed it I &apos;d have throwed her out.&quot; 



i» 



I went in to breakfast in a subdued mood. Johnson was there, 
looking with a shocked expression at the sausages, and shuddering 
in a new bangle and a collar that was six times taller than the 
previous one. His wife, with a fresh bracelet, was glaring at the 
same viand, and the expression in her eye seemed to say, &quot; Where 
am I ? Is this a horrid dream ? &quot; It was the only morning in six 
months, too, when the sausages had n&apos;t either fallen under the grate 
or been dropped on the stairs, and this made their conduct all the 
more uncalled-for. 

At lunch-time Johnson&apos;s wife appeared in another fresh 
bracelet, and with a profusion of jewellery on her right forefinger. 
And as for Johnson, astounding as it may seem, he had a third 
bangle on. Evidently he had one for each meal, and this was his 
lunch-bangle. 

In the evening the lady had another silk dress on, and it 
exposed one knob more of her spine than her previous one. Johnson 
wore his second clean collar and his dinner-bangle, and his small 
countenance, looming over his great expanse of shirt-front, looked 
like a pallid bird of prey on the top of an icy mountain. They 
talked together in scraps of inferior French, and when the meal was 
over Mrs. Johnson again smote the piano, and then retired coldly 
to her own apartments. 



10 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

That night we held an indignation meeting on the balcony. 
The landlady had deposited the vegetable-dish out there through 
the window when she was getting ready to make her turbulent 
entry with the pudding, and had forgotten it Inside there were 
two candles burning, and one lamp with a broken shade — the gas 
had been cut off for non-payment. The bread was in a plate on top 
of the piano, and the dishes were in an unwashed condition down- 
stairs, and the mistress of the house was singing a shrill melody in 
the kitchen. And amid these surroundings Bem, the Polish 
tailor, passed a resolution that he would drive Johnson off the 
premises, or die in the attempt. After that our souls felt relieved, 
and we settled down to placid harmony. Somebody found some 
liquor in a bottle under his bed and brought it down. The cards 
were fished out, and we played Nap, and gave each other I O U&apos;s 
on a lavish scale. The lamp flickered and went out with an awful 
smell. Then one of the candles died amid a tremendous blob of 
grease, and we gave up playing, and smoked in the semi-darkness. 
The bread cast a long, gaunt shadow on top of the piano, and the 
vegetable-dish was still forgotten on the balcony. And, finally, our 
landlady burst in with the green dress partially open at the back, 
and wearing a hat decorated with six broken feathers ; and fell over 
the cat in the doorway ; and played some tune that was all discords, 
on the piano, while Bem sang a dirge about some forgotten period 
when he lived alongside a river, and went out musing with a female 
by moonlight. He was so moved by the recollection that he wept 
into the last candle, and it went out also, leaving us in darkness. 

I woke on that third morning with a vague and indefinable 
feeling that somebody had died in the night. There was a Sabbath 
calm brooding over Jones&apos;s boarding-house which was quite foreign 
to that clamorous establishment, and as I listened it suddenly 
occurred to me that Bem must have carried out his threat, and 
dynamited Johnson in the darkness. All the doors seemed to 
close softly, instead of shutting with a soul-destroying bang as usual. 
The landlady flopped about gently on her trodden-down shoes, 

m

instead of bringing in the breakfast with a crash and a shriek, and 
shedding dishes about in all directions; and she rang the bell 
gently, whereas she usually rang it like a dray-load of escaped 
lunatics. I descended the stairs amid a prevailing smell of ham 
and eggs, and went into the dining-room. 

Johnson was breakfasting with a troubled expression and a 
bangle, and his wife was glaring across the table. Opposite them 
Bern was solemnly feeding in evening dress. He looked absolutely 
vacant, and seemed to be lost in profound thought, and the frantic 
excitement of the other eight boarders made no impression on him 
at all. He wore a pair of kid gloves and a bracelet, and his 
moustache was elegantly waxed. Johnson rose at last, and walked 
round this apparition, but the apparition never moved. Finally 
the Pole got up, and thoughtfully extracted an ancient, battered 
straw hat from under his chair, and, having jammed it hard down 
on his head, he went out of the room and out of the house like a 
man who was lost in profound vacancy. 

Nobody spoke. A species of paralysis seemed to have 
descended on that boarding-house. But, after a moment, Johnson 
rushed on to the balcony and glared in a cataleptic fashion after 
this unaccountable visitant. And outside, on the stairs, stood a 
petrified landlady, in a smudged green dress, and with a hat with 
six broken feathers in it cocked rakishly over one eye, and two 
misfit shoes that seemed to have taken root in the floor. She held 
a teapot in one hand and a pie in the other, and she was un- 
consciously pouring the tea into the pie, and the pie on to the 
staircase. 

Bem turned up in the evening costume again at lunch-time, 
but, though expectation rose to fever-heat, nothing happened. Owing 
to mental strain, however, the landlady fainted in the sink in the 
course of the afternoon. 

At dinner, the Johnsons began to show signs of wear and tear. 
INIrs. Johnson&apos;s left eyebrow was out of line, and her complexion had 
shifted round to her ear. Evidently it had been put on with a

reckless hand, while the wearer was under the influence of 
considerable excitement. Her husband had an enraged and 
harassed look, and his tie was off the straight, and his hair was 
crumpled. The landlady&apos;s shoes were in the hall, from which I 
gathered that she had lost them in her agitation ; and her hat was 
under the table. As for that joyous Bohemian herself, she was 
dodging round in a semi-hysterical condition, and when I entered 
she had just given Johnson the whole dish of potatoes, and had 
shoved the entire joint on another boarder&apos;s plate, after which she 
deposited the kettle in an abstracted manner on the tablecloth. 
Then she fled unaccountably round the table and supplied us all 
with a number of other remarkable things too numerous aud too 
badly assorted to mention. There was a dead and awful silence in 
the company — a silence that was too awful to be accounted for on 
the supposition that Bem had appeared again in evening-dress and 
caused a panic. For one awful moment the thought occurred to 
me that the insane Pole might possibly have appeared clothed in 
a marked scarcity of dress of any kind 

He entered at that moment, carefully removing a shiny bell- 
topper as he came in, and depositing a pair of gloves in its inmost 
recesses. He was attired in grey pants and a linen jacket, but he 
had taken the sleeves out of the jacket and out of his shirt, and he 
was &quot; cut low &quot; at the neck. Also, he wore a gold bracelet — in fact, 
he was a remarkably good copy of Johnson&apos;s wife. The landlady 
uttered a shriek when she saw him, and disappeared down the 
stairs. The cat escaped up the chimney, scattering last night&apos;s dead 
ashes out of the grate as it went. The other boarders choked with 
insane glee, but Bem only contemplated them for an instant with a 
lack-lustre eye and a funereal visage, and sat down. He was the 
one unmoved individual in the company. 

Then Johnson arose, and shaking a fork in the air with a 
palsied hand, he made a brief oration. 

&quot; I give notice,&quot; he shrieked, &quot; that I will leave this den of 
infamy at the end of this week. I am accustomed — I mean, I am 
not accustomed — British constitution — degraded parody upon a 



A ROW IN OUR BOARDING-HOUSE. 13 

mman being — I refuse to associate — dash and confound the — the — 
objectionable ruffian opposite — insolent outrage upon all gentle- 
manly sentiment — gorilla on the other side of the table &quot; 

He gave out there, and choked. &quot;With a wild howl he heaved 
up the table and capsized the ruins of it bodily at Bern, and then 
he tramped heavily over the debris and engaged his enemy in mortal 
combat. The Pole emerged from the wreckage, and with his hair 
full of gravy, and corned beef in both ears, and one eye stopped up 
with cabbage, and mustard streaming down his back, he flew at 
Johnson like a wild cat. The candles went out ; Mrs. Johnson 
shrieked in the passage ; the landlady wailed dismally in the 
kitchen ; and all was horror and confusion. 

There was an item in Johnson&apos;s bill when he left, which read : 
*&apos; Broken crockery, 22s. 6d.&quot; I believe he hypothecated his lunch- 
bangle to pay it. The gas has been turned on again since then, and 
the landlady sings weird songs to us in the gloaming, with her hair 
down as of old. She wears the same green dress, and drops her 
shoes all over the house as before, but it is n&apos;t the same landlady — 
the old one broke her neck on the stairs as beforementioned, and 
her daughter has inherited her clothes and the business, and she 
rings the dinner-bell with even more vim than her lamented pre- 
decessor. She reminds me very much of her mother, for she drops 
the meals on the stairs in a way that calls up sad, pathetic 
memories ; and she rushes in as recklessly holding out the gravy in 
front of her, and rushes out again as madly to look for the 
vegetables, as her deceased relative could have done. Johnson is 
in gaol somewhere — there was a gap in his accounts which even his 
jewellery could not fill ; and the wife has eloped with our new land- 
lady&apos;s husband, the printer. Also, nobody wears evening-dress at 
our boarding-house any more.

SOME OF FATE&apos;S PUPPETS. 

LOOKING toward his home, Moore caught a glimpse of light 
^ through the trees. It came from his wife&apos;s bedroom, most 
likely ? He wondered vaguely what would be her greeting. 
She had expected him to return in five weeks ; it was exn-ctly five 
hours since she had waved good-bye to him from the wharf. He 
pondered without interest the question what she would have 
thought, and said, and done, had the other steamer been moving 
just a little faster and sent them all to eternity. 

&quot;He had expected to find the house in darkness. Yet where 
was the need to alter his pace % What did he gain by getting home 
a minute sooner — say, before his wife put out her light ? He would 
have to depict the scene of the collision for her ; and he was in the 
wrong mood for that. She would be full of wifely interest, womanly 
sympathy, about his share. Could a woman never escape from her 
sex ? Exalted to a position of mock heroism by his wife ! In con- 
templation of the part marked for him he felt that he could weep — 
tears of petulance. 

The thought recurred — if it had ended otherwise, giving his 
wife the freedom to shape her course anew ? A loss or gain to 
her? Neither, in any great degree, he could answer. She would 
marry again ; he could look calmly at that, with even a smile at 
his inability to give distinct features to the figure his fancy conjured 
up as his successor. There was the boy — a different matter ; but as 
he had his father&apos;s blood in him, he could be left almost un- 
considered ; he would work out his own destiny. 

His wife was eight years younger — barely thirty ; bright, clever, 
good-looking. One who met life gaily, — who, with a nature as deep 
as anyone&apos;s, yet immersed herself in superficialities. An anomaly ; 

14 




SOME OF FATE&apos;S PUPPETS. 25 

ie centre of it hidden from him. Their natures were widely 
divergent : they were fettered together, yet trod separate paths. 

Was that to be regretted ? No ; or at least in a very limited 
number of aspects. Their married life fell midway between 
happiness and discontent, touching neither. Life to him was mostly 
on that plane. 

Perhaps the one thing he regretted — if anything in life were 
serious enough to demand regret — was the fact of his marrying at 
all. That had been a mistake ; one among many ; all the natural 
issue of the mistake of continuing to live. A world of error ! How 
C50uld it be otherwise, when the right thing lay undecipherable amid 
1 bewilderment of illusion ? 

Looking up at the house, he noted that it was the drawing- 
room that was lighted — a matter that called for surprise ; but he was 
reluctant to confess to any. The drawing-room was seldom used at 
aight, the dining-room downstairs being occupied as a sitting-room. 
Only when visitors came in the evening — an unusual event — was 
it necessary to go upstairs. 

He went to the back of the house and found it dark. The 
servants must have gone to bed, but that was denied in the fact of 
visitors being present. They had gone out before the visitors came, 
and had not returned ? Yet that seemed unlikely, since the house was 
shut. He tried one door — to find it locked. Was it that his wife 
was alone, and feeling timid had locked up the house before the 
servants came in ? Then there were no visitors, and she was sitting 
by herself in the drawing-room — a change from her ordinary habit, 
induced by her loneliness. Probably she had been at the piano. 
On this theory the seeming contradictions were congruous and 
intelligible. 

He was about to ascend the back stairs when he remembered 
that the key of one door had been lost a few days before. He 
turned the handle and entered; darkness enveloped him. He 
walked carefully, so as not to startle his wife by any noise. He was 
fortunate enough to find a clear passage, and reaching the foot of the 
stairs safely he began to ascend, keeping a hand on the balustrade. 



16 ^&apos;jetjj bulletin story book. 

The silence of the house seemed an ominous thing ; Moore 
caught himself stopping to listen to it. At the turning he halted ; 
his heart was beating strangely fast, his blood alert, as if expectant 
of something. He was visited by an outrageous thought. &quot; Was 
ho in the wrong house ? &quot; He was about to consider the question, 
to sum up remembrance, when he heard a voice — pitched, sustained, 
with a musical clearness in the sound — a man&apos;s voice. He was 
struck aghast — the thing was so contrary to anything the circum- 
stances made possible. He was awake, and in his own home. His 
mind ran back, but he found no rest for his thought ; no haziness 
in his remembrance. A gleam of light shot across the events of the 
day, revealing them to him in one immediate glance — distinct and 
in order, carrying him to his presence there. 

He had ascended to the top of the stairs, and his hand now 
encountered an overcoat. The touch of it sent a shock through 
him that reduced him to material facts of life. He took up the hat 
that was on the stair-post, and, handling it, was vaguely glad he 
could not name the owner. Neither did the voice help him to a 
guess, though he heard it more distinctly now — the voice of a man 
reading aloud. 

Why was his first conscious instinct a desire to escape — to 
descend the stairs and go out into the street till he could consider 
what to do ? Surely small consideration was necessary ; his 
imperative duty lay before him, not behind. Was it that he felt 
some charity towards his wife ? Was it for her sake that he did not 
wish to come upon them ? Or was it wholly a fear to take up his 
own part in the discovery ; a fear that had masked itself in subtle 
disguise ? 

He had leaned back against the wall, but now stood up ; he 
was in no need of support. But he could not calm his heart ; his 
blood tingled through his veins, giving him an odd sense of a new 
value in life — a value that deficient human senses could not quite 
lay hold of. Existence seemed to promise something. A clear 
happiness when his present task was accomplished ? He asked him- 
self the question.

SOME OF FATE&apos;S PUPPETS. 17 



Looking up the corridor, he saw the ray of light that came 
through the drawing-room door. What was the scene that the door 
hid from him ? And what was the basis of the sudden, bitter 
prayer that it should close fast now, and, opening to no one&apos;s effort, 
bury those two within walls ? It was the awakening of the 
husband within him : he knew it, and felt it in a weakening of 
his blood. He was no longer his old self, but one among a hundred ; 
acting a part that had so often been acted before — the meanest part 
that could be given to a high-minded man. In angry denial of such 
conception of himself — in attempt to shut it out, he went up the 
passage. 

The length appeared interminable, the noise of his walking was 
deafening, and the walls seemed to close in upon him as he passed. 
Even at the threshold of the door he had a prompting that it was 
not too late to turn back ; but he compressed his lips and entered. 
A flood of warm light seemed to close around him. The fancy 
gave him strength ; he became calmer ; it was as if he had been 
spiritually welcomed. 

In one glimpse he saw the pair ; the noise of his footsteps had 
alarmed them ; they stood separate, the first instinctive movement of 
each had been towards an individual defence. The identity of the 
man gave no surprise ; he was not able to be surprised, more intense 
feelings finding place with him. 

It was Leston, a young doctor who had recently come 
to the town. He remembered, even at this turbulent moment, 
that he had once remarked to his wife that Leston was distinctly 
a good-looking man ; a judgment that she had not wholly 
acceded to. Was this idle word the germinal cause of his present 
dishonour ? The thing was almost worth enquiry. He could not 
recall that there had been much intimacy between his wife and 
Leston. But then the husband is ever the last to see what is 
happening at his side. 

She was dressed in a pale blue tea-gown, a ribbon at her throat. 
He could think that this evening she must have looked remarkably 
well, but now the deadly pallor and set cast of her features showed

only a mind in travail. She was standing behind a chair, her hands 
clasping the back of it. 

She was small in stature, but carried herself well ; her eyes 
gave a depth, her lips were finely cut, her face in every pose showed 
the strength of fearlessness. Young, with good features and an 
abundance of dark brown hair, she was a woman who impressed 
one with a sense of woman&apos;s witchery over man. 

&quot; You !&quot; she said quiveringly, almost as he entered. It seemed as 
if the word broke from her, before she was conscious of the effort to 
speak. 

He crossed over to the mantelpiece, and, resting one arm there, 
stood facing her. He could see that Leston was shifting his gaze 
from one to the other, unknowing what to do, or what was to be 
done. The feverish excitement of his wife stirred an echo in him : 
he endeavoured to steady his voice. 

&quot; I have disturbed you,&quot; he said. 

&quot; It seems like it ! &quot; Her laughter rang out ; recklessness, 
nervousness, echoing in the notes of it. 

She knew now that he had long suspected her ; that his 
departure had been but a trick. He had come back to discover 
the thing he looked for. In her feminine mind, the pitiful mean- 
ness of his manner of unmasking her — not to include the full 
success of it — made him appear contemptible. For the moment, her 
sin was in some retrospective way justified by it ; and she was 
conscious of the vividness of the impression that she too gained in 
being no longer compelled to deceive. How much easier it was to 
acknowledge guilt than it would have been to deny ! 

Moore kept his eyes off Leston ; he was aware of being more 
assured of the man&apos;s weakness than of his own strength. And his 
wife would feel a keener shame in his looking to her as the only 
guilty one. 

He addressed himself to her with gay pretence. &apos;* A friend of 
yours ? &quot; 

Could any man but he be so infamous as to amuse himself with 
her shame ? Could he not see that the shame was partly his ? 



r

She would force him to feel it. &quot;You can call him what you 
like.&quot; 

&quot;A lover, then?&quot; 

She had courted the word, yet her woman&apos;s nature felt a stab. 
&quot; Lover ! &quot; It seemed to cry itself in the street, to be caught on 
the wind, and carried echoing to the ears of the outer world. 
But she had compelled him to explicitly attack her. &quot; You have 
defined him — and yourself,&quot; she said. 

&quot; And also you.&quot; 

Strange that she had not foreseen to what she would lay herself 
open. Was it that her mind was not capable of calm thought 1 
Must she acknowledge that she was not able to cope with him ? 
She saw her woman&apos;s heart as the foundation of defeat. Was his 
strength more than of manhood — an individual element in him 1 
She felt suddenly that he could do as he willed with her ; that he 
could make her kneel to him ; make her pitifully repentant. She 
saw the future and its threats against her ; a word rang in her 
brain that would not be driven out. 

In protest of finding herself at that depth, she looked at the 
man for whom she had sacrificed herself. But there was no help 
for her there ; he was younger, more hesitating than herself. In a 
flash she realised that she was more to blame than he ; that she had 
not less misshaped his life, than her own. Shiveringly she felt her 
isolation ; a guilty woman at the mercy of the world. 

Moore watched her unflinchingly. He was surprised at the 
ease with which he had taken command of the situation ; how 
calmly he held it. A few moments before he had not known what 
to do, but now he could think coolly, see clearly. Victory was his, 
even a kind of victory over Fate, who had prepared a situation in 
which he was to have been made to play a ridiculously pitiful part. 

He felt no pang in knowing he was a dishonoured husband, and 
endeavored to persuade himself that there was no reason why he 
should feel one. But he was wise enough to know that his strength 
lay in contempt of the pair before him, in making them realise 
themselves contemptible. 



20 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

&quot; What is the book ? &quot; he asked, gazing at a volume that lay 
open on the floor where it had been dropped. 

&quot; Does that interest you ? &quot; she said angrily. 

&quot; Naturally. It has interested you.&quot; 

&quot; A loving husband ! &quot; She laughed scornfully — at herself 
and him. 

&quot; You seem to regret something.&quot; 

&quot; Our marriage ? &quot; she suggested. 

&quot; My God, woman, not half as much as I do— as I have done 
from the first.&quot; 

He moved his arm, and accidentally upset a vase ; it fell on 
the floor breaking into fragments. The noise resounded through 
the house. To the woman&apos;s excited fancy it was a signal of some- 
thing that was to happen ; she looked to the door expecting to see 
a terrifying shape take entrance. She listened, and afar off she 
thought she heard the faint tolling of a bell. Her heart stopped, 
then beat to the tolling. She felt chilled to the blood. 

Leston stood watching the scene before him with a weak 
resentment of his impotence. The fear that had first seized him 
had in contemplation of the husband&apos;s calmness given place to a 
desire to assert himself, to claim a share in the guilt. It was 
distinctly a situation that demanded a show of courage from him. 
Yet he was completely ignored. The tragedy which he had helped 
to create was being played out without one thought of him. He 
chafed at the humiliation of his position, yet could not summon the 
courage to escape from it. 

Moore considered the import of the silence, then permitted 
himself to add, at a measured pace — &quot; We both made a mistake. 
And the issue — we have here. Well, even of that I can bear my 
part. But your part — I honestly pity.&quot; 

She seemed heedless of all around; her eyes hung on the 
doorway expectantly. &quot;I can do without it,&quot; she said 
pettishly. 

&quot; I am aware of that, and I can easily understand it. You 
get rid of me, and you take in my place — this.&quot; He turned to 



I 



SOME OF FATE&apos;S PUPPETS, 21 



Leston, and the man shrank back ashamed. &quot; A pretty boy, young 
enough to be educated to appreciate you.&quot; 

&quot; Oh, stop ! stop ! &quot; she cried. 

A child, barefooted and clad in a nightgown, stood hesitant 
at the door. He was about seven years old, and in features 
a likeness of his father. The mother saw him, and called him to 
her with a look. 

Moore followed her gaze, and knew then that it was not the 
sting of his words that had moved her, but only the fear of the 
child understanding. &quot; Frank ! &quot; he said sharply to the boy, 
&quot; Come here ! &quot; 

Disobedience of that voice was impossible ; he came like a dog. 

&quot; Close the door — and take that chair.&quot; 

The boy did his bidding, and then sat looking at his mother ; 
his childish astonishment addressed to her. 

The woman stood up with locked hands — supplicating, speech- 
less. 

&quot; You are not forbidden to look upon him,&quot; said Moore, coldly, 
in answer. 

&quot; Send him away,&quot; she whispered, quiveringly. 

&quot; His proper place is here.&quot; 

She flung herself on the chair, in a passion of weeping, her 
soul given up to despair. 

&quot; Father, &quot; began the boy. 

&quot; Sit there, sir ! Don&apos;t move till I tell you ! &quot; he was answered. 

Leston crossed over and stood beside the woman ; an opening was 
offered him. &quot; For the child&apos;s sake, if not for hers, send him away ! &quot; 

Moore laughed in contemptuous derision. &quot;Surely you are 
imposing on your position ! &quot; 

&quot; I do not know about that, but you are cruelly imposing upon 
yours.&quot; 

&quot; If you dare to question me, by the living God I&apos;ll throw you 
over that balcony ! &quot; His violent utterance rang true, and the echo 
of it, adding further excitement to his blood, made him dangerously 
apt to do what he threatened. 



22 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; Don&apos;t speak to him ! &quot; said Mrs. Moore, in alarmed protest. 

&quot; You do not know how passionate And you can do no 

good.&quot; 

Leston, warm in offence, hated now to acknowledge to a 
physical fear. With his whole soul he longed for action. But for 
her sake he must submit ; and because he was so checked and 
hampered he began to look forward to escape. Yet honour 
compelled him to stay. 

&quot; How long is this going to continue ? &quot; he said at length. 
&quot; What are you going to do ? &quot; 

&quot; There is nothing more for me to do ; the rest falls on you ! &quot; 
The man&apos;s thought ran to dramatic utterance. Yet he had an 
educated disdain of the stage. 

«♦ What am /to do?&quot; 

&quot; Leave this house at once — and take her with you.&quot; 
Moore was only outwardly calm ; his strength had departed, 
and he knew that he was physically ill. He feared that he 
could not maintain his part to the end. He wished they 
would hurry — a mad desire to escape from the room had seized 
him. 

&quot; Come, Lucy ! &quot; said Leston, bending over her. He wondered 
that he should so quietly accept the burden of her, though he knew 
there was nothing else that he could do. 

Her sobs had ceased ; she sat with her face hidden, giving no 
sign that she heard. 

&quot; Lucy ! &quot; It was an appeal to her to look up, so that he might 
read the reason of her unwillingness. 

She jumped up quickly, and, throwing herself out of his em- 
bracing arms, staggered against a small desk that stood by the wall, 
and halted with her back to it. 

&quot; No, I will not go ! &quot; she cried. &quot; Not though he orders it. I 
stay here — my place is here. I could not go with you. How could 

you think of it ? It would mean &quot; She turned quickly to her 

husband. &quot; Can I stay ? Only till to-morrow. See, I ask it ; on 
my knees, if I must.&quot; 



I 



SOME OF FATE&apos;S PUPPETS, 23 



&quot; You can do as you will,&quot; he said, simply. &quot; I will offer no 
objection now.&quot; 

She turned to Leston, speaking from a centre that was hidden 
from him. &quot;You can go.&quot; 

&quot; But you ! &quot; 

&quot; Go ! &quot; she commanded. 

He made his pitiful departure. Moore felt an infinite relief ; 
he sat down wearily in a chair, his face turned from her. 

She saw the depth of his despair, and her heart moved madly 
— responsive to her thoughts. Her fault rose up behind her, 
threatening to advance and overwhelm her — a purpose beckoned 
her to escape. 

&quot; Will you put Frank to bed f &quot; She spoke quietly ; a new 
strength had been given her. 

He looked up in surprise. The fact of having to be told by her 
what he must do was a shock to him. He saw how far beneath 
command of himself he had sunk, but he made no eflTort to recover. 

&quot; Yes,&quot; he said. 

The child followed him, nervous, crying pitifully, and was the 
more abandoned in his tears that he knew not very definitely why 
he should cry. 

In quieting him, Moore promised that his mother would not 
leave him ; that she would not be permitted. He attempted to 
persuade himself that though he had lost a wife, he had no right to 
deprive the child of a mother. He felt happier in such a thought, 
though he knew he was but juggling with his mind. 

The soft promises he had to make to the boy helped to soothe 
himself as well. But he saw no course of action, nor what in honour 
he could offer her. 

He went back to the drawing-room, possessed of a full in- 
difference. He himself was under no necessities. Fate could do 
with him as it would. Or his wife could decide what was to be ; 
he would stand aside, offering no opposition to either. 

&quot;You have come back,&quot; she said. &quot; I hoped you would.&quot; He 
acquiesced dully and stood by the doorway. He had a horror of 



24 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

taking up his old position by the mantelpiece. The woman read a 
hatred of coming near to her. 

He had leisure to notice her ; to see that her face paled and 
flushed, that her eyes were luminously bright. She stood as when 
he had left her, yet her attitude seemed constrained. 

He had to break through a silence. &quot; What is it you want 
with me ? &quot; 

&quot; Nothing. Unless &quot; 

&quot;Well?&quot; 

&quot; To hear your reproaches.&quot; 

&quot; Lucy I &quot; He reproached her levity. 

She laughed defiantly, but her laughter rang hollow. &quot; Tell me 
how much you despise me,&quot; she said. &quot; How much you hate me I 
Do ! &quot; 

&quot; How much I pity you ; how much I pity us both ! &quot; 

&quot; Oh, Harry ! Not that,&quot; she said with a shiver. &quot; Do not 
conquer me ! Be harsh ! Treat me as I deserve ! Why don&apos;t you 
hate me?&quot; 

&quot; Say because Frank does n&apos;t. He will not let his mother leave 
him j I had to promise that she would not.&quot; 

She looked long in silence ; as if she could not credit him. 
Her breath came in short gasps. Not till he again glanced up at 
her did she find utterance. &quot; The poor child — the darling ! And I 
— my pride in him should have saved me. I wonder why it did not ? 
I have been mad this last month — not myself. Oh, the horror 
of it now ! &quot; 

&quot;Will you stay?&quot; 

&quot; You had to promise him, you say. That was cruelly hard 
on you.&quot; 

&quot; I have not said that. Will you stay ? &quot; 

He was aware that he was ofiering her all that was in his 
heart ; and more than was in his mind. He knew not where he 
stood. His head swam ; the walls of the room seemed to recede, 
then halt and come slowly back. He looked up — to see his wife 
fall forward on her face. 



SOME OF FATE&apos;S PUPPETS. 25 



nnshaped fears. He lifted her in his arms and turned her face 
towards him. 

&quot; Lucy, what is it ? You are ill ! You have hurt yourself ! &quot; 
A convulsion seized her, and left her with her features set in 
distortion. 

&quot; You would take me back ? &quot; she whispered. 

&quot; For his sake.&quot; 

&quot; Ah, yes,&quot; she sighed. She held a pause, then asked — &quot; Not 
for my own ? &quot; 

His face hardened ; she asked more than he could give her. 

&quot; Let me go !&quot; she cried. &quot;Do not hold me! How can you 
when you hate me so ? &quot; Her violence carried her out of his arms, 
and she stopped at a distance from him. 

&quot; I do not hate you, Lucy. You know I don&apos;t. But I cannot 
pretend that I have forgiven you.&quot; 

&quot; I did not ask for that ; I only meant — but it does n&apos;t matter. 
It is best that it should end now.&quot; 

&quot;End, Lucyt&quot; 

&quot; Can&apos;t you see ? &quot; she cried fiercely. 

He caught an inspiration from her tone ; an infinite horror 
surged through him. &quot; Lucy ! have you poisoned yourself 1 &quot; He 
made a step towards her. 

&quot; Don&apos;t come near me ! &quot; she screamed, raising herself on her 
hands. &quot; I will not let you touch me ! &quot; 

&quot; Lucy ! &quot; Horror held him in its embrace ; he was capable 
only of a weak utterance of her name. 

&quot; Listen ! &quot; she cried excitedly. &quot; Frank is calling me. You 
hear him ? Let me go to him ! &quot; She looked up for permission, as 
he stood senselessly watching her. 

&quot; Do not follow me ! &quot; she said. &quot; Let me go alone. I must see 
him before &quot; 

She staggered to her feet, and, reaching the doorway, steadied 
herself there and went down the passage. 

The child was crying upon the bed ; her screams had alarmed

him. She hurried, and coining heavily against the wall staggered 
back from it — fell, with outstretched hands — quivered, and lay 
motionless. 

Moore, looking vacantly down at her, wondered dully why the 
child was sobbing.

H 



LONG CHARLEY&apos;S GOOD LITTLE WIFE. 

THERE waa the island, only ten miles away, and there it had 
been for a whole week. Sometimes we got near enough to 
see Long Charley&apos;s house and the figures of natives walking 
on the yellow beach ; and then the westerly current would take us 
kway to leeward again. But that night a squall came up, and in 
ilf-an-hour we were running down to the land. When the lights 
the beach showed up we hove-to until daylight, and then found 
le surf too heavy to let us land. 

We got in close to the reef, and could see that the trader&apos;s&gt;pra-house was full, for there were hundreds of bags outside, 

raiting our boats. It was clearly worth stajring for. The trader, 

tall, thin, py jama-clad man, came down to the water&apos;s edge, waved 

long arm, and then turned back and sat down on a bag of copra. 

&apos;&apos;e went about and passed the village again, and once more the 

long man came to the water&apos;s edge, waved his arm, and retired to 

his seat. 

In the afternoon we saw a native and Charley together among 
the bags ; then the native left him, and, as it was now low tide, the 
kanaka was able to walk to the edge of the reef, where he signalled 
to us. Seeing that he meant to swim ofif, the skipper went in as 
close as possible, and backed his fore-yard. Watching his chance 
for a lull in the still fierce breakers, the native slid over the reef and 
swam out to us as only a Line Islander or a Tokelau man can swim. 
&quot; How &apos;s Charley 1 &quot; we asked, when the dark man reached the 
deck. 

&quot; Who ? Charley ? Oh, he fine ! plenty copra. Tapa ! my 
bowels are filled with the sea — for one dollar ! Here ariki vaka 
(captain) and you titbi tubi (supercargo),&quot; said the native, removing 



28 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

from his perforated and pendulous ear-lobe a little roll of leaf, 
&quot; take this letter from the mean one that giveth but a dollar for 
facing such a galu (surf). Hast plenty tobacco on board, friends of 
my heart ? Apa, the surf ! Not a canoe crew could the white man 
get to face it. Is it good twist tobacco, friends, or the flat cakes ? 
Know that I am a man of Nanomea, not one of these dog-eating 
people here, and a strong swimmer ; else the letter had not come.&quot; 
The supercargo took the note. It was rolled up in many 
thicknesses of banana-leaf, which had kept it dry : — 

&quot;Dear Friends, — I have Been waiting for you for near 5 
months. I am Chock full of Cobberah and Shark Fins one Ton. I 
am near Starved Out, No Biscit, no Beef, no flour, not Enything 
to Eat. for god&apos;s Saik send me a case of Gin ashore if you don&apos;t 
mean to Hang on till the sea goes Down. Not a Woman comes 
Near me because I am Run out of Traid so please try also to Send 
a Peece of Good print as there are some fine Women here from 
Nukunau and I think I can get one for a wife if I am smart. If 
you Can&apos;t take my Cobberah and mean to Go away send the Squair 
face* for god&apos;s saik and something for the Woman. — Your obliged 
Friend, Charles.&quot; 

We parcelled a bottle of gin round with a small coir line, and 
sent it ashore by the Nanomea man. Charley and a number of 
natives came to the edge of the reef to lend a hand in landing the 
bearer of the treasure. Then they all waded back to the beach, 
headed by the white man in the dirty pyjamas and sodden-looking 
fala hat. Reaching his house he turned his following away and 
shut the door. 

&quot; I bet a dollar he would n&apos;t swap billets with the angel 
Gabriel at this partickler moment,&quot; said the profane mate, thought- 
fully. 

We started weighing and shipping the copra next day. After 
finishing up, the solemn Charley invited the skipper and supercargo 
* 3quare-face= Hollands gin. 



LONG CHARLEYS GOOD LITTLE WIFE, 29 



, jto remain ashore till morning. His great trouble, he told us, was 
that he had not yet secured a wife, &quot;a reg&apos;lar wife, y&apos;know.&quot; He 
hid, unluckily, &quot;lost the run &quot; of the last Mrs. Charley during his 
a jsence at another island of the group, and negotiations with various 
ocal young women had been broken oflf owing to his having run out 
f trade. In the South Seas, as in Australia and elsewhere, to get 
he girl of your heart is generally a mere matter of trade. There 
ere, he told us with a melancholy look, &quot; some fine Nukunau 
jfirls here on a visit, but the one I want don&apos;t seem to care much 
iljout stayin&apos;, unless all this new trade fetches her.&quot; 
&quot; Who is she ? &quot; inquired the skipper. 
&quot;Tibakwa&apos;s daughter.&quot; 

&quot; Let &apos;s have a look at her ! &quot; said the skipper, a man of kind 
iiipulses, who felt sorry at the intermittency of the Long One&apos;s 
&apos;oimubial relations. 

The tall, scraggy trader shambled to the door and bawled out 
&apos; Tibakwa, Tibakwa, Tibakwa, O ! &quot; three times. 

The people singing in the big mo7iiep or town-house stopped 

ir monotonous droning, and the name of Tibakwa was yelled 

iferously throughout the village in true Gilbert Group style. In 

Gilberts, if a native in one corner of a house speaks to another 

11 the opposite corner, he bawls loud enough to be heard a mile off. 

Tibakwa (The Shark) was a short, squat fellow, with his broad 
ick and chest scored and seamed with an intricate and inartistic 
It work of cicatrices made by shark&apos;s-teeth swords. His hair, 
araight, coarse and jet-black, was cut away square from just above 
lis eyebrows to the top of his ears, leaving his fierce countenance in 
I sort of frame. Each ear-lobe bore a load — one had two or three 
sticks of tobacco, twined in and about the distended circle of flesh, 
uid the other a clasp-knife and wooden pipe. Stripped to the waist, 
ic showed his muscular outlines to perfection, and he sat down 
unasked in the bold, self-confident, half -defiant manner natural to 
the Line Islander. 

&quot; Where &apos;s Tirau 1 &quot; asked the trader. 



30 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

i 

&quot; Here,&quot; said the man of wounds, pointing outside, and he 
called out in a voice like the bellow of a bull — &quot; Tirau 0, nako 
mai / &quot; (Come here !) 

Tirau came in timidly, clothed only in a ridi or girdle, and 
slunk into a far corner. 

The melancholy trader and the father pulled her out, and she 
dumped herself down in the middle of the room with a muttered 
&quot; B pudkdkd te matan /&quot; (Bad white man !) 

&quot; Fine girl, Charley,&quot; said the skipper, digging him in the ribs. 
&quot; Ought to suit you, eh ! Make a good little wife.&quot; 

Negotiations commenced anew. Father willing to part, girl 
frightened — commenced to cry. The astute Charley brought out 
some new trade. Tirau&apos;s eyes here displayed a faint interest. 
Charley threw her, with the air of a prince, a whole piece of turkey 
twill, twelve yards — value three dollars, cost about 2s. 3d. Tirau 
put out a little hand and drew it gingerly toward her. Tibakwa 
gave us an atrocious wink. 

&quot; She &apos;s cottoned ! &quot; exclaimed Charley. 

And thus, without empty and hollow display, were two loving 
hearts made to beat as one. As a practical proof of the solemnity 
of the occasion, the bridegroom then and there gave Tirau his bunch 
of keys, which she carefully tied to a strand of her ridi, and, 
smoking one of the captain&apos;s Manilas, she proceeded to bash out 
the mosquitoes from the nuptial couch with a fan. We assisted her, 
an hour afterwards, to hoist the sleeping body of Long Charley 
therein ; and, telling her to bathe his head in the morning with cold 
water, we turned to go. 

** Good-bye, Tirau ! &quot; we said. 

&quot; Tiakapo&quot;* said the Good Little Wife, as she rolled up an 
empty square gin-bottle in one of Charley&apos;s shirts for a pillow, and 
disposed her graceful figure on the floor mats, beside his bed, to 
fight mosquitoes until daylight. 

Louis Beckh. 

• &quot;Good -night.&apos; 



&quot;ON THE LAND.&quot; 

HOT! 
A blistering heat, that drove the fowls, with their beaks 
gaping, off the burning ground into the shelter of the slab 
hut. A scorching, withering heat, that had made sapless hay of the 
grass in the paddocks, and reddened the foliage of the gums and 
1-he stringy-barks as they would have been reddened by the blaze 
of a bush-fire. A heat that had sucked up all moisture, and 
marbled the land with cracks of shrinkage, and turned the 
waterholes into mere mud-baths ; while the distant creek had 
]iothing but its brown flag-grass and dry swampy bed to show 
where the water had flowed. 

About the homestead, the few cattle still alive hung with their 
lieads stolidly over the slip-rails, refusing, in spite of all driving, to 
seek again for the sustenance it was impossible to find. The frame- 
work of a horse, his head between his legs, and as much in shade as 
he could get on the lee side of an old ironbark, stood impassive and 
motionless. All round the horizon, a dirty haze of smoke, that 
melted into a yellow veil of fog covering the sky. 

The sun glared down. The air shimmered tremulously, as 
though it sickened with its burden. And over all that land not one 
gleam of freshness, not one sound of joy, not a murmur save the 
eternal zing-zing-zing of the locust. Seared, blasted, stricken, a 
curse upon it and upon every living thing. 

Abe Saunders was down at what used to be the creek, trying 
to drag out his last milking cow from the place where she had 
bogged in a vain efibrt to find water-grass. 

Abe hauled and strained at the rope, his shirt and trousers 
clinging to him with sweat. The beast kicked and plunged feebly, 



32 T^^ BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

its little strength quite gone ; and after two hours&apos; work it was 
more firmly bogged than ever. 

&quot; It &apos;s no good,&quot; said Abe, &quot; I must get help ; 1 11 go up the 
gully for old Mason and his tackle. If we lose that cow, what will 
the children do for milk ? &quot; 

Wearily he turned to go, when the sound of a &quot; Coo-ee ! &quot; 
turned him sharply about. 

&quot; Coo-ee ! &quot; he shouted. 

A little pause, and again the cry echoed. 

&quot; Coo-ee ! &quot; 

&quot; It &apos;s Mary,&quot; he said ; &quot; what the devil &apos;s up ? &quot; It was a good 
three miles to the ridge ; but, like a wallaby with the dogs in full 
cry, he sped over rock and gully back to the homestead. Long 
before he got there, he heard a strange roaring in the air, saw 
black, belching clouds over the tree tops, and felt a fierce rushing 
furnace beneath. 

The bush was on fire. 

With the energy of fear he dashed along. There was the 
clearing, with Mary at the house-door still shouting at intervals. 
Even as he came up, the red storm was upon them. In mad frenzy 
he seized the two children, one under each arm, and shrieking to 
his wife above the din of the fire to bring the baby, he rushed to 
the centre of the ploughed paddock. There they crouched panting. 
The children were howling, the baby was crying, and Mary was 
sobbing. The man said nothing. He watched the fire. 

Would the house escape ? There was fifty feet of bare ground 
all about it. But the air, so calm a minute ago, was now a roaring 
hurricane travelling at racing speed over the ridge. The tea-tree 
scrub melted before it, and the bush trees remained in its rear only 
as black and burning trunks. The fence had caught ; the flames 
licked it up daintily. The shed, with his cart and harness, stood, 
and was gone, while he looked. A piece of burning stringy-bark, 
whirled by the wind, settled on the shingles of the house. The 
woman moaned and pressed the child closer to her bosom. The 
man&apos;s face was drawn in agony. 



**0N THE LAND.&quot;* 33 

Week by week, day by day, he had seen the work of his 
life perish under the merciless sun. The best of his cattle were 
festering carcasses ; his horses were dead, though his last pound had 
been spent in hay for them. His season&apos;s crop was sickly beyond 
redemption. All this he had borne, and still toiled on in the 
unequal struggle. 

And now the house was burning, the work of his own hands. 
How many months of weary sawing and splitting had its shingles 
and slabs cost him ? He thought of it all as he stood there, helpless 
and half-sutfocated. In less than a minute the flames were shooting 
out of the doorways and windows, and a loud report was followed 
by the fall of a side of the house. It was the explosion of his 
powder-flask, hung on the wall. 

&quot; Can&apos;t you put it out, Abe ? &quot; 

&quot; Put out hell ! &quot; And he ground his teeth. 

Through the open frame-work they could see the bed, the 
table, the chairs all blazing one after another. The spirit of the 
man revolted. 

&quot; Look, Mary ! &quot; he cried, ** there goes the cradle I made for the 
kids.&quot; And as he spoke the aspect of his face changed. The limit 
of his suffering had come, and, like an old-time victim of the rack, 
he began to laugh. A hollow laugh, weird and terrible. 

&quot; That&apos;s a good joke, Mary ! The farce is ended — all over in 
one act ! Ha, ha, ha ! &quot; 

&quot; You &apos;re mad, Abe !&quot; said his wife, shrinking from him, with a 
great dread in her eyes. &quot; Don&apos;t laugh like that. It &apos;s horrible ! &quot; 

&quot; Mad, my dear ! That &apos;s good. Ha, ha, ha ! Say I &apos;ve been 
mad — the most confounded lunatic in this blasted, blistering country. 
To slog and belt for ten long years to make a home of our own ; to 
clear land, to fence it, drain it, plant it — and all to make five 
minutes&apos; bonfire ! Yes, I &apos;ve been mad — stark, staring mad ; but now 
— ha, ha, ha ! — I was never so sensible in my life ! 

&quot; See how the cradle burns, Mary ! It was a bit of she-oak, and 
worked like a watch. Does n&apos;t it look pretty now ? — they might be 
silk curtains, all those flounces round it ! Why don&apos;t you laugh, 
c

girl ? — it &apos;s a great joke. I ook ! the roof is falling in. It &apos;s as good 
as fireworks. Hold up the kids ; let them laugh 1 It &apos;s all the same 
price. Ha, ha, ha ! &quot; 

But the woman replied nothing, frightened, staring at him. 
The children screamed. 

The driving sheet of flame had long gone by. Skirting the 
ploughed ground where they stood, it had left the bare surface an 
untouched blank in its ghastly funeral trail. Only tree-stumps, 
posts, and fallen branches smoked and smouldered here and there. 
The man stood motionless till nothing remained of his home but 
the four charred corner-posts. 

&quot; Let &apos;s see the play out ! &quot; he said. &quot; Ha, ha, ha ! Ha, ha, ha ! &quot; 

The fire was raging many miles further onward when Abe 
Saunders, taking the two children by the hand, led the way down 
the track to the main road. His wife dragged wearily after him, 
the baby in her arms, looking back from time to time at the 
smoking ruin. 

The group passed on to the road, where the red dust blew in 
thick, choking clouds that shrouded them from view. But long 
after they had disappeared there sounded the wail of the children, 
the moaning of the woman, and loud above all the mirthless 
laughter of a broken-hearted man.

THE PARSON&apos;S BLACK-BOY. 

THE Rev. Joseph Simmondsen had been appointed by his 
Bishop to a cure of souls in the Far North, in the days 
when Queensland was an ungodly and unsanctified place. 
Naturally, the Rev. J., who was young, green, and zealous, saw a 
direct mission in front of hiuL His predecessor had never gone 
twenty miles outside the little seaport that formed the commercial 
outlet of the district ; but this did not suit Joseph&apos;s eager tempera- 
ment. Once he felt his footing and gained a little experience, he 
determined on a lengthened tour that should embrace the uttermost 
limits of his fold. 

Now, although beset with the conceit and priggishness in- 
separable from the early stages of parsonhood, Sinmiondsen was not 
a bad fellow, and glimpses of his manly nature would at times peep 
out in spite of himself. This, without his knowledge, ensured him 
a decent welcome ; and he got a good distance inland under most 
favourable auspices, for, the weather being fine, everybody was 
willing to lend him a horse or drive him along to the next station 
upon his route. The Rev. Joseph began to think that the rough- 
ness of the back country had been much exaggerated. 

In due course he arrived at a station which we will call Upton 
Downs ; beyond it there were only a few newly-taken-up runs. On 
Upton Downs they were busy mustering, and when the parson 
enquired about his way for the next day the manager looked 
rather puzzled. &quot; You see,&quot; he said, &quot; we are rather short-handed, 
and I can&apos;t spare a man to send with you ; at the same time the 
track from here to Gundewarra is not very plain, and I am afraid 
you might not be able to follow it. However, I will see what I 
can do.&quot; 

35 



36 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Mr. Simmondsen wr.s retiring to rest that night when a 
whispered conversation made itself audible in the next room. No 
words were distinguishable, but from the sounds of smothered 
laughter a good joke seemed to be in progress. 

&quot; I think I can manage for you,&quot; said the manager at breakfast 
next morning. &quot; When you leave here you will go to Gundewarra, 
25 miles. From there it is 35 miles to Bil ton&apos;s Camp, and 10 on to 
Blue Grass. From Blue Grass you can come straight back here 
across the bush, about 40 miles. I will lend you a blackboy who 
knows the country well and will see you round safely.&quot; 

The young clergyman thanked his host, and, after breakfast, 
prepared to leave. The blackboy, a good-looking little fellow 
arrayed in clean moles and twill shirt, was in attendance with a led 
pack-horse, and the two departed. 

For some miles the Reverend Joseph improved the occasion by 
a little pious talk to the boy, who spoke fairly good English, and 
showed a white set of teeth when he laughed, as he constantly did 
at everything the parson said. At midday they camped for an hour 
on the bank of a lagoon, in which Mr. Simmondsen had a refreshing 
swim. In the evening they arrived at their destination, and 
received the usual welcome. 

&quot; I see you adapt yourself to the customs of the country,&quot; said 
his host at mealtime, and a slight titter went round the table. The 
Rev. Joseph joined in, taking it for granted that his somewhat un- 
clerical garb was alluded to In reply to enquiries he was informed 
that Bilton&apos;s Camp was a rough place, and Blue Grass even worse ; 
and he was pleased to hear it, for until then his path had been too 
pleasant altogether ; he had n&apos;t had a chance to reprove anybody. 

Bilton&apos;s Camp proved to be indeed a rough place. The men were 
civil, however, and as the parson had taken another exhilarating bath 
at the midday camp he appreciated the rude fare set before him ; 
although here, as at the other place, there seemed to be a joke 
i&apos;oating about that made everybody snigger. 

The next day&apos;s journey, to Blue Grass, was but a short stage, 
and as the reverend gentleman had by this time become very 



THE PABSOJrs BLACK-BOY. S7 

friendly with Charley, the blackboy, the two rode along chatting 
pleasantly until they came somewhat unexpectedly on the new 
camp. 

A very greasy cook and two or three gins in dilapidated shirts 
were the only people at home, and they stood open-eyed to greet the 
stranger. 

Although Mr. Simmondsen had suited his attire to his 
surroundings, he still retained enough of the clerical garb to signify 
his profession. The cook, therefore, at once took in the situation, 
and invited the parson under the tarpaulin which did temporary 
duty as a hut. 

He informed his visitor, at whom he looked rather curiously, 
that &quot; everyone &quot; was away, camped out, and that no one would 
return for a couple of days ; that he was alone, excepting for two 
men who were at work in a yard a short distance oflf, and who 
would be in to dinner; — in fact, they came up while he was 
speaking. Mr. Simmondsen took great interest in this, the first 
real &quot; outside &quot; camp he had seen ; and as the two bushmen had 
gone down to the creek for a wash, and the cook was busy preparing 
a meal, he called Charley to ask him a few questions. 

&quot; What are these black women doing about the place, 
Charley?&quot; 

&quot; O ! all about missus belongah whitefellow,&quot; was the 
astonishing reply. 

It was some moments before Joseph could grasp the full sense 
of this communication ; then he considered it his duty to read these 
sinners a severe lecture, and prepared one accordingly. 

&quot; Do you not understand,&quot; he said, when the three men were 
together, &quot; the trespass you are committing against both social and 
Divine laws ? If you do not respect one, perhaps you will the 
other.&quot; 

The cook stared at the bushmen in blank amazement, and the 
bushmen at the cook. 

&quot; I allude to these unfortunate and misled beings,&quot; said the 
parson, waving his hand towards the half-clad gins. 



38 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

A roar of laughter wba the reply. &quot; Blest if that does n&apos;t come 
well from you 1 &quot; said the cook, when he could speak. The others 
chuckled in acquiescence. 

&quot; What do you mean ? &quot; said the indignant Joseph ; &quot; I speak 
by right of my office.&quot; 

&quot; Sit down and have some tucker,&quot; said the cook, &quot; you &apos;re not 
a bad sort, I can see ; but don&apos;t come the blooming innercent ! &quot; 

The indignant pastor refused. He saw that his words were 
treated lightly, that no one would listen to him, and he left in high 
dudgeon. Charley had told him that there was a good lagoon about 
twelve miles on the road back to Upton Downs ; he would go on 
there and camp — they had plenty of provisions on the pack-horse — 
and taking his bridle and calling the boy he went to catch his 
horse. 

As he came back he overheard the fag-end of a remark the 
cook was making to the others. &quot; They came round the end of the 
scrub chatting as thick as thieves, and when I seed who it was — 
Lord ! you could have wiped me out with one hand.&quot; 

This was worse than Greek to the Rev. Joseph. Greek he 
might have understood. In spite of a humble apology from the 
delinquent, he departed, and near sundown arrived at the lagoon 
Charley had spoken of. It was a lovely spot. One end was thick 
with broad-leaved water-lilies, but there was a clear patch at the 
other end promising the swim the good parson enjoyed so much. 

When the tent was pitched he stood in Nature&apos;s garb about to 
enter the water, when Charley called to him. .Pointing towards the 
lilies, he told Mr. Simmondsen that he would get him some seed-pods 
which the blacks thought splendid eating. The clergyman had only 
got up to his waist when he heard a plunge behind him and saw 
Charley&apos;s dark form half splashing, half swimming towards the 
lilies. Presently his head emerged from a dive, and he beckoned 
towards the clergyman to come over and taste the aboriginal luxury. 
The Rev. Joseph paddled lazily over and investigated The seed- 
pods proved of very pleasant flavour, and as the sun was nearly down, 
Mr. Simmondsen wended his way to the bank and emerged in the 



THE PARSOirS BLACK-BOY. 89 

shallow water, with Charley a few paces behind him. For some 
reason he looked back. Shocking predicament ! There was no 
shirking the fact ; all the quiet laughter about &quot; the customs of the 
country,&quot; the unexplained allusions, the ribald manner of the cook, 
were intelligible in a flash. Charley was a woman ! 

The wicked manager of Upton Downs had started him on his 
travels with (&quot;after the custom of the country&quot;) a black gin 
dressed in boy&apos;s clothes as a valet, and that gin evidently had been 
recognised by everyone on the road. Mr. Siramondsen thought of 
the past and blushed. That night wa£ spent in fervent prayer. 

&quot; My dear sir,&quot; said Davis, the super, of Upton Downs, &quot; I did 
the best I could for you. Charlotte is as good as any blackboy, and 
knows all the country round here. Now, own up, did n&apos;t she look 
after you well ? &quot; 

* You forget the scandal that may arise,&quot; said the Rev. Joseph 
Simmondsen. 

&quot; Lord, man ! who cares about what is done out here ? Nobody 
will ever hear of it.&quot; 

Davis was wrong. Everybody did hear of it. The Rev. 
Simmondsen received indignant letters from his Bishop, his church- 
wardens, several missionary societies, and, last and worst, a letter 
of eternal farewell from the young lady to whom he was engaged 
to be married. Fortunately he inherited some money at the time, 
so he did the best thing possible — threw up the church, went into 
squatting, and is now one of the most popular men in this 
district.

ESTHER. 

ESTHER was a frail little girl, with a face so thin and wan that 
the freckles seemed to have fallen like a merciful veil upon 
it. She was not pretty. Her hair was too short to plait, 
not long enough to hang gracefully loose, and its jfibre was 
altogether too contrary for curls. So it hung miserably about her 
ears, ragged and tattered like the remnant of a flag that might have 
issued from the fire and smoke of battle. 

She was a friendless orphan, which fact made her a born 
servant to somebody. Old Mrs. MacSmith had secured her services 
from the State when she first began to toddle on two legs — two legs 
that soon became bowed under the pots and pans she had to carry 
in her small arms — and next to her heart. 

Thenceforth the MacSmith household was perpetually in a 
state of war. Her mistress beat her. Esther screamed, and fought 
fiercely. But Mrs. MacSmith had a duty to perform. So she 
would grip the little rebel by the windpipe, and call for 
&quot; Mac.&quot; He always came, swift and sure, and the enemy was 
routed. 

Thus, for all the eight years of her life, Esther&apos;s existence had 
been one of screams and pain. She was such a bold, bad girl, — a 
mere handful, but with a stubborn heart, primed so full of foolish 
courage that it must surely have burst, were it not for the vent- 
pipes that relieved the pressure when Esther called people names, 
and would n&apos;t work, and scratched the collective face of the 
MacSmith family with finger-nails kept sharp for that purpose. 
And she had two other safety-valves to her feelings. One was to 
laugh hysterically when, for exhibition purposes, she was expected 
to cry ; and the other was to sob heart-breakingly when someone 



ESTHER. 41 

tried to cheer her with a kind word. Mr. Giles, the parson, once 
said of her : 

&quot;A regular passion-flower, my dear; but not quite so pretty.&quot; 
A simile so vague that Esther resentfully poked out her tongue. 

The MacSinith family had only one greeting to bestow — &quot; You 
little wretch ! &quot; 

The canker grew in Esther&apos;s heart. At times, she stole in 
through the window of the empty cottage next door, and, alone and 
unobserved, began talking to herself. It was the one little sociable 
break in her martyrdom. 

&quot; Why don&apos;t I die 1 &quot; she asked herself once. 

She was eating a green apple. She took another bite, and 
swallowed it. 

&quot; That&apos;s why,&quot; she said. ** Because I &apos;m a greedy-guts.&quot; 

And then, after a pause, and looking wistfully at the cold fire- 
place, she added : 

« Oh, I do wish I did n&apos;t eat ! &quot; 

&quot; Why don&apos;t I run away ? &quot; was the next question. 

She waxed violent at this. 

&quot; Because I &apos;m a looney ; and here goes for squashing old 
Mother MacSraith, anyway.&quot; She brought down the heel of her 
boot on a large black spider, creeping on the floor. 

&quot; That &apos;s forty-three times I &apos;ve killed her now ! &quot; she commented, 
surveying the remains with satisfaction. &quot; And it was twice a frog, 
and once a mary-bug.&quot; She laughed shrilly. &quot; Oh, I &apos;11 kill her 
yet,&quot; she added. 

The helpless buzzing of a fly, caught in a spider&apos;s web, came 
from a corner. Esther investigated. She killed the spider, and 
threw the rescued fly out of the window. 

Soon after this the cottage found a tenant. Mr. and Mrs. 
MuUampy, a pair newly wed, brought in their furniture. 

Their honeymoon had been a very nice luminary while it lasted. 
The cheers of their friends, and the rice, and the proverbial old 



42 THE BULLETIN STOBT BOOK. 

shoe, had given them entrance to married life with quite a 
violent propulsion. But the law of gravitation told, and they 
slowed down. Then the rainbow lost the glory of its tints ; the 
mantle of chimney-smoke fell on their air-castles ; and they them- 
selves came right down to the bed-rock of the prosaic. When they 
could n&apos;t get down any further they commenced to argue. Then 
the price of meat went up ; the milkman began to call regularly ; 
and married life on a solid basis had begun. 

Esther took a great interest in their arguments. Tiptoeing 
her way on to the very threshold of the Mullampys&apos; kitchen at 
meal-time, she would listen attentively. And she learnt many 
things. She found that she was not the only unhappy person in the 
world. Once she saw the husband lift his hand to strike his wife. 
&quot; Don&apos;t ! &quot; Esther screamed. The hand was arrested. Esther ran 
away. 

After that, the child&apos;s presence came to be one of the sub- 
conscious details of their domestic dramas. Nor did they resent it. 
In their inmost hearts they felt that Esther&apos;s shadow, falling 
athwart the doorway, was to them Love&apos;s decoy-bird, a creature 
swaying them with such a strange influence that more than once 
the man was tempted to crush his pride and call the child in to 
plead for a kiss with the woman he really loved. And the woman, 
being weaker, could not keep the pain ,out of her eyes. Yet she, 
too, was very proud. 

Often, in the midst of bitter recrimination, the husband would 
suddenly stop short and glance fearfully at the door. Esther&apos;s 
ragged head would pop quickly back, and the man, with increased 
colour, would get up awkwardly from the table and vanish through 
the opposite doorway. 

On one of these occasions, when the husband had left the room, 
Esther dropped something heavily on the floor. Mrs. MuUampy 
looked up from the table, and her visitor, looking very red and 
guilty, advanced towards her. In one hand, which hung limp and 
passive by her side, a large horse-shoe dangled. 



ESTHER. 48 

&quot;Whatever do &quot; 

&quot; Please, don&apos;t ; I know I &apos;m wicked.&quot; 

&quot; What &apos;a that for ? &quot; Mrs. MuUampy pointed at the horse- 
shoe. 

&quot; &apos;Cos if I don&apos;t tell no lies I won&apos;t go to heaven,&quot; said Esther, 
a little mixed, and trying to nerve herself, in a roundabout way, for 
a momentous admission. She drew a long breath. 

&quot; To brain him vnthy please ! &quot; she said. 

&quot; Who ? &quot; 

&quot; Him. &apos;Cos he wanted to hit you.&quot; 

Mrs. Mullampy looked at her in silence for a while. Esther 
hated to be pitied. She gave her head a proud toss, calculated to 
change the compassionate expression of the woman&apos;s eyes. 

&quot; I hate him ! &quot; she said, spitefully. She tossed her head again. 
This time two gum-leaves and a twig dropped from her tangled hair 
to the floor. 

&quot; My dear child !&quot; the woman said, softly. 

Esther&apos;s lip quivered. Then she thought of the spider she had 
killed on the very spot where she was standing. The recollection 
made her more cheerful. Mrs. Mullampy picked up the horse-shoe. 

&quot; Would you hit m« with this, Esther 1 &quot; she asked. 

The child shook her head. 

♦* Well, then, don&apos;t hit him I If you do, you &apos;11 hit me.&quot; 

Esther&apos;s mouth opened wide. 

&quot; &apos;T ain&apos;t a boomerang like Joe MacSmith&apos;s,&quot; she said, sharply. 

Mrs. Mullampy made an impatient gesture. She bit her lip, 
as though restraining an exclamation. 

&quot; You don&apos;t understand,&quot; she said. 

A sweet temptation came over her, and she lifted the child on 
to her knees, and with all the patience of a loving teacher com- 
menced to explain. She outpoured the long pent-up secrets of her 
heart to Esther Anon a querulous note crept into her voice — a 
compromise of sweet and bitter — a woman&apos;s sense of being wronged 
struggling with the unreasoning vagaries of a forgiving heart. 

Esther was not listening. Once or twice she fancied she heard 



44 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Mrs. MacSmith&apos;s voice calling her from the next yard. She was 
tired of sitting on Mrs. Mullampy&apos;s knee. The shrill cry of her 
mistress rang out unmistakably now. She felt uneasy. 

&quot; Let me down, please.&quot; 

&quot; Don&apos;t go yet, Esther ! &quot; the woman pleaded, &quot; I want to say 
something.&quot; 

But Esther had reached the door. 

Mrs. MuUampy, after all, was little more than a girl herself. 
The romantic story and the coy admissions seemed to linger about 
every ornament in the room when the child had gone. A china 
peacock over the mantel-piece, with tail outspread, repeated dis- 
tinctly, she thought, her own words : 

&quot; I love him, Esther ! &quot; 

And the voice of that peacock overwhelmed her. She sat 
aghast. Then slowly, like an apple ripening in an hour, her cheeks 
grew red. She snatched at the tablecloth and buried her face in 
it, like a school-girl trying to hide her blushes. 

Esther had not gone. She cautiously peeped round the door- 
way. The horse-shoe was dangling with one end poked through a 
tear in her skirt. She could n&apos;t keep her thoughts off that spider. 
She was tracing with her eyes the different routes it might have 
taken if she had not intercepted it. Her conjectures brought her 
glance to the corner door. It was ajar, and she saw Mr. Mullampy 
looking at his wife through the opening. And she saw Mrs. 
Mullampy start and cry out when she uncovered her head and 
found her husband standing beside her. 

&quot; Jane,&quot; he said, softly, &quot; I heard all. Forgive me ! &quot; 

The woman was too happy to trust herself yet. With the 
blind instinct of her sex, which always makes a show of flying 
in the face of Fate, however friendly it may be, she pretended to be 
angry at being found out. 

&quot; Oh,&quot; she said pettishly, &quot; it &apos;s all Esther&apos;s fault. She made me 
say it.&quot; 

&quot; Then God bless Esther ! &quot; said the man. 



ESTHER, 45 

The girl had run round the back way, and was peeping through 
the window. She saw them kiss. The woman&apos;s arms were round 
the man&apos;s neck. 

Then Esther began to cry. She felt that she alone was 
miserable and unhappy. 

\&quot;I&apos;ve a good mind to throw it,&quot; she said, raising the horse- 
shoe threateningly. &quot; Only I can&apos;t hit him without hitting her.&quot; 

&quot;Anyway, for luck!&quot; she added, throwing it over her left 
shoulder. It fell heavily on a stray fowl belonging to Mrs. 
MacSmith. Esther clapped her hands in glee. 

Then she took a farewell peep through the window, and that 
which she saw, whatever it was, made her say : 

« Crikey ! &quot; 

J. J. O&apos;Mbaba.

I. — Bill&apos;s Yarn. 

&quot; \70TJ don&apos;t believe in &apos;em ? &quot; said Bill. « I did n&apos;t, either— one 
J time. But if ever you see one — like I did — and you lose 
your girl through it — like I did — you &apos;11 believe in &apos;em 
right enough, I promise you ! &quot; 

« Did the girl see it too, Bill ? &quot; 

&quot; My word.&quot; 

&quot; Were you scared ? &quot; 

&quot; Was I scared ! Would you be scared if you saw six foot long 
of ghost coming at you ? &quot; 

&quot; Tell us about it, Bill.&quot; i 

&quot; Well, mind you, this is a true yarn, and you &apos;d better make 
up your minds there &apos;s nothin&apos; funny in it. And there &apos;s nothin&apos; to 
laugh at in it, either. So, if any of you fellows wants to laugh, 
he &apos;d better start now, and we &apos;11 go outside an&apos; see whether he can 
give me a hidin&apos; or I can give him one. Lend &apos;s a match.&quot; And 
Bill lit his pipe. 

We promised Bill that we would take his yarn seriously, 
because we could see he would be annoyed if we did n&apos;t, and Bill 
scales 12st. 131b. 

&quot; They was havin&apos; races at Bogalong,&quot; said Bill, &quot; at the pub. 
And there was a little girl working there that I was shook on, 
name of Mary — Mary — darned if I don&apos;t forget her other name. 
Now, that &apos;s curious, too ! Mary — well, no matter. Never mind 
her other name. But I. thought a lot of that girl those days. 
There was a jockey, though, named Joe Chanter, and I always 
thought he was the white-headed boy with Mary, and I had no 
show. But she was only stringing him on, after all Only Joe 
never found it out. He was ridin&apos; a colt for the publican this day

in the Maiden, and the colt bolted and ran into a fence and chucked 
Joe, and they picked him up with his face stove in and his neck 
broke. He was n&apos;t a bad sort, Joe ; a long, slim chap he was — 
tall as me, but thin — some of you chaps might ha&apos; knowed him ? 
No ? Lend &apos;s a match. 

&quot; Mary did n&apos;t seem much cut-up over the accident, though she 
was keeping the other women company in howlin&apos; most of the after- 
noon. But all the women cheered up a bit after supper, and it was 
decided not to put off the dance at night, because there was a great 
crowd there, and the publican said it did n&apos;t matter about Joe — Joe 
wouldn&apos;t mind. Landlord was thinking about what he&apos;d lose, you 
see, if they broke up the party. So they cleared the kitchen, and 
the fiddles played up, and at it they went. Now, I never was much 
of a dancer, and Mary was n&apos;t dancin&apos;, either ; she was helpin&apos; in 
the bar ; so I went in and talked to her instead. By-and-by I got 
her to come away and sit in the best parlour with me. 

&quot; There was nobody there, and we sat down on the sofa, and 
got a bit confidential, and she said, when I asked her was n&apos;t she 
shook on Joe, * No, indeed, not on Joe.&apos; There was somebody else 
— she said. I asked her who was he ? She says, * A lot you care ! &apos; 
&apos;Indeed I do care a lot, Mary,&apos; I says. *I don&apos;t believe you care 
anything at all about me,&apos; she says, half crying. * Why,&apos; I says, 
&apos; Mary, you ought to know &apos; (an&apos; she did know, too, only she was 
foxin&apos;) * that there *s nobody in all the world I do care about except 
you.&apos; Then she began to say something, out couldn&apos;t get it out for 
crying, an&apos; I cut in. &apos; Don&apos;t you know, Mary, that I love you ? &apos; 
* I don&apos;t know,&apos; says she. * Well, I do, then,&apos; I says, &apos; more than 
anything else in the whole world. Tell me, do you like me a little ? 
(I got that out of a book I &apos;d been readin&apos;. Sounds silly rot, doesn&apos;t 
it ? Lend &apos;s a match.) 

&quot;&apos;Yes, I do, Bill,&apos; says she, * and I never liked anyone else.* 
Well, then, of course you know what a fellow &apos;11 do when a 
girl talks that way, and they &apos;re by themselves. By the Lord, boys, 
it was a treat to kiss that girl. She was just an armful of loveliness. 
Funny thing I can&apos;t think of her name. The music was going it

out at the back all the time, and they were dancin&apos; away no end. 
Presently Mary says she &apos;d have to go ; she might be wanted ; and, 
of course, I said she &apos;d have to give me another kiss before she 
went. And she was just doin&apos; it, when, all of a sudden, she turns 
white an&apos; says — 

&quot; * Oh, Bill, how wicked we are !&apos; 

« * Why, Mary,&apos; says I, &apos; what &apos;s wicked about this lot ? &quot; 

&quot; * Just think. Bill,&apos; she says, &apos;here we are, talkin&apos; love and 
kissing, an&apos; poor Joe Chanter lyin&apos; dead in the very next room ! &apos; 

&quot; &apos; Great Scott ! &apos; says I ; &apos;is he ?&apos; and then Mary began to 
cry and laugh both together like, but she was hardly started when 
I hears an almighty bump on the floor in the next room, and then 
we both looks up, and there was Joe ! He was standing at the 
door, wrapped up in his windin&apos;-sheet, and his face was covered 
with blood. Mary gave one yell and ran out by the other door, 
and me after her, like blazes ! Scared 1 Now, would n&apos;t that ha&apos; 
scared you ? Lend &apos;s a match.&quot; 

&quot; Well, and what waa it. Bill ? &quot; 

&quot; Great Scott, ain&apos;t I tellin&apos; you ! It was Joe ! Can&apos;t a man 
trust his own flamin&apos; eyesight ? &quot; 

&quot;And what happened after?&quot; 

&quot; Nothin&apos;. Joe was dead enough when the rest came in and 
looked, and they wouldn&apos;t believe what I told &apos;em. Only Mary 
would n&apos;t look at me next day — seemed frightened like — so I came 
away. I &apos;ve never been to Bogolong since.&quot; 

We all thought Bill&apos;s yarn a very unsatisfactory one, yet we 
could n&apos;t get any more out of him. But six months afterwards I 
heard Jim&apos;s yam. 

II. — Jim&apos;s Yarn. 

&quot; BoGALONG ? &quot; said Jim. &quot; Yes, I &apos;ve been there, and I don&apos;t want 
to go there any more. It was a bit funny, though, all the same. 
Oh, all right, I &apos;11 tell you all about it. 

&quot; I &apos;d just delivered a mob of stores at Pilligi, and as I was 
comin&apos; back, I made Bogalong about dusk. I thought I might as

well b^ a swell for once, havin&apos; a bit of stuff, so I reckoned I &apos;d stay 
at the pub. all night. So I put my horse up, and had a drink, and 
asked if I could have a bed. But the place was full up — they &apos;d 
been havin&apos; races that day — and they said there was no bed for me, 
so I was goin&apos; away. But the publican called me back — I s&apos;pose 
he guessed I had a cheque on me — and said he &apos;d find room for me 
somewhere. * There &apos;s a double bed,&apos; says he, * if you don&apos;t mind 
sharin&apos; it with another man. He &apos;s a very quiet fellow,* he says ; 
* I &apos;11 answer for him not disturbiniy you.&apos; So I said all right, and 
after I had a few more drinks I went to bed. They had a dance 
on, but I was n&apos;t in the humour for dancin&apos;, for it was a hot night, 
and I was tired. 

&quot; The other fellow must ha* been that way, too, I thought, for 
he was in bed already, I saw, when I went in. I did n&apos;t take much 
notice of him, except that he seemed pretty well covered up, for 
such a hot night. But after I put the light out, an&apos; lay down, I 
found that I &apos;d have to cover up, too, or else the mosquitoes would 
eat me. So I pulled the sheet off the cove an&apos; rolled it round 
myself, and went to sleep. But the noise of the music and the 
dancin&apos; woke me up after a bit, and I lay awake, growlin&apos; a bit to 
myself for a time, an&apos; I was just goin&apos; off again, when I heard some- 
one talkin&apos; in the next room. I had left the door open, an&apos; could 
hear quite plain. I was goin&apos; to sing out to them to clear out, or 
shut the door, or something, but when I heard what they were 
sayin&apos;, I thought it was too good to miss, so I listened. 

&quot; It was some fellow doin&apos; a mash with a girl, and I could n&apos;t 
help laughin&apos; to myself to think how mad he &apos;d be if he knew some- 
body was listening. He was pretty solid with the girl, I could tell, 
and by-and-by he started kissin&apos; her, an&apos; I nearly burst myself 
laughin&apos; when that began, and he called her sweetheart, and darling, 
and all that. I was goin&apos; to wake up my mate, and let him share 
the fun, but I thought they might hear me, so I lay very quiet, 
until presently the girl says, * Oh, Bill ! and poor Joe lyin&apos; dead in 
the very next room ! &apos; 

&quot; I shoves out my hand as quick as lightning, and feels

for my mate&apos;s face, and- -Great Lord ! it was as cold as a 
snake ! 

&quot; &apos; Holy Wars ! &apos; I says, and I gives one bound out of bed, 
forgetting all about the sheet bein&apos; wrapped round my legs. I came 
down an awful buster, and my nose hit the side of the bed, and 
started to bleed like a waterspout But I picked myself up and 
made for the door, and then I saw the fellow and the girl sitting 
together on the sofa. They had one look at me — I was still rolled 
up in the sheet, and the blood was running down my face — and 
then they cleared. By Jove they did travel ! I got my clothes on 
— I did n&apos;t much care about going in for them, though — and went 
out to the stable and got my horse and took the road for it, and 
went on to Blind Creek, and camped there. 

&quot; But you &apos;d ha&apos; laughed to see how them two footed it ! &quot;

THE BOND. 

INTO the deserted waiting-room, where the evening shadows 
were deepening, a woman came with a slow, uneven footstep. 

She was the last patient but one, and even as she crossed the 
threshold she heard the door of the doctor&apos;s consulting-room close 
behind the final case for the day, and knew that already she had 
faded out of the busy man&apos;s mind. 

She was only one of many, and her case was not even an 
individual one. Daily such conditions as hers came under the 
doctor&apos;s notice, and he forgot her before she had passed out mto 
the hall. 

Her fine grey eyes were dazed ; her beautiful mouth, made to 
curve so graciously, drooped with the flabby movement by which 
great misery alters the firmest, sweetest lips. 

In that little room down the passage a hard blow had fallen 
on her, and she sank trembling into a chair and held her hands to 
her eyes. Dream buds, so tenderly, so carefully loved and nurtured, 
had been shrivelled to death in a bitter wind. Fair-winged hopes 
were dashed to the ground, their wings broken, and all flying 
stopped for ever. 

She had been told that she never could be a mother. 

And at home — that fair home of hers — was the husband, who 
often had dreamed away to her longingly of the little bright-faced 
child with shining hair, and eyes of the purest blue, who was to 
walk beside him some day, and whisper to him tender child-things 
with her hand in his. 

&quot; It must be a little girl.&quot; How often he had said it ! 

&quot; A little girl, because she will be like you.&quot; 

And they even talked about her name — this little being whose 

51 



52 TIIE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

coming had never been heralded. The mother called her Star- 
Baby ; the father, little Annie, for that was the mother&apos;s name, and 
there could be none better. 

And had there been anyone to listen, he would have thought 
their child was already with them, a real, living little one. Their 
lips were always lingering round its name. . . . &quot;I must bring the 
little one something in my pocket to-night.&quot; ...&quot; We must never 
let little Annie pull the cat&apos;s whiskers, as these children are doing.&quot; 
...&quot; I should like to buy baby a doll&apos;s perambulator, like that 
little girl&apos;s.&quot; 

And sometimes the mother would go on tiptoe to the bedside, 
and bend down and whisper, &quot; She is fast asleep.&quot; And the father, 
not to be outdone in this fond, foolish, primeval tenderness, would 
say, &quot; I think I hear her calling &apos; Daddy ! &apos; &quot; — and he would come 
back presently and say, &quot; The little girl was frightened of the dark.&quot; 

Father ! Mother ! Never, never could it be ! 

Her heart sickened at the thought of her husband. To her a 
grief, a sadness that would shadow all her life. To him it would be 
an anguish that would turn all his future into Dead-Sea fruit. 

He was a man born to be a father. Every child loved him 
and came slowly, hesitatingly as children will, but always surely, to 
his side. He had the indescribable art of making conversation 
with children. He talked to them as if they were as old as he, and 
that is what wins the little hearts. 

They had been married now two years, and for one the world 
had held no one but themselves — he for her only, she for God in 
him. It was in the second year she learned of his longing for a 
little life he would love to join to theirs. 

Then all the latent motherhood in her sprang to flame, and 
burnt with a bright, ever-deepening glow that sent a warmth over 
heart and brain, and changed the whole aspect of life. Self began 
to dwindle, dwindle The rush of love flowed over everything that 
had life — her plants and flowers, and birds and dogs ; — the mystery 
of their birth awoke strange thrills in her heart, and their helpless- 
ness brought the wonderful bud of maternity into fuller, lovelier 



THE BOND. 53 

bloom. Out of love sprang love, and all the &quot;vvaifs and strays of the 
world were touched with this tide of mother tenderness. She could 
hardly believe it was she, herself, who felt so. She had never 
known that she would care for children. Every woman loves to 
hold a baby and kiss the helpless hands and feet, and that had 
been all the extent of her love for children until then. 
And now it was all over. 

&quot; I saw a tiny thing to-day, just like little Annie,&quot; he was 
saying. 

They were sitting alone on their verandah that looked over a 
rose-garden towards the sea. Dusk was falling, and here and there 
the light of a coasting steamer gleamed far out on the Pacific. 

&quot; Did you, dear? &apos;* she forced herself to answer. A week, and 
she had not told him. A subtle change had come over the bright- 
ness of her face ; in the depths of her eyes lurked weariness. 

&quot; Her father was a working man.&quot; 

*&apos; You were glad of that ; you were able to give her one of 
your endless pennies.&quot; 

&quot; You &apos;re a witch. I own I never see these little things with- 
out wanting to give them something, and she was so tiny, and had 
just ]ier fair curls.&quot; 

For they had often looked, in dreams, on the face of their little 
one ; they knew every line and curve, every light and shade of the 
little features. 

He came and flung himself at her side, and leaned his head 
against her knee. He reached up for her hand, and brought it to 
rest on his head. 

&quot; Big Annie,&quot; he whispered. 

&quot; Yes,&quot; she whispered back to him, and tried to keep the pain 
out of her voice. 

&quot; Do you know what I was thinking ? . . . I love you — truest, 
dearest woman — I love you. . . . You seem to me to be more and 
more beautiful every day. . . . But sometimes, girl, sometimes we 
are a little lonely. . . . We are not enough for each other. I look 



64 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

forward and see a time when we might — might care for each other 
a little less, and then a little less. . . . But the time will never 
come. . . . That is why I want the little one so much. Did I 
hurt you ? &quot; 

&quot;A little. . . . You might tire of me — might love me less.&quot; 

&quot; Never, never. It is impossible. But it must be born in me 
to love a child, and I am stunted until then. Then I shall love you 
doubly, trebly, a thousand times more dearly.&quot; 

&quot; But, they say,&quot; she murmured — and this was the poor little 
one straw she had been clinging to so desperately the whole week 
past — &quot; they say that a childless man and woman love each other 
more dearly than those who are fathers and mothers. Their love 
retains its early freshness — is a truer comradeship. They are all in 
all to each other, for there is no one to divide their hearts 
with.&quot; 

&quot; That may be true of some, not of us — not of you, not of me. 
She will be the great, enduring, eternal bond, the only bond that 
can never weaken.&quot; 

Like a child himself, he whispered against her knee that he 
longed 30 for the little arms to be round his neck, for the little 
cheek to be against his ; that he yearned to carry her about from 
room to room in his arms, to buy her dollies, and little baby 
toys. . . . 

She thought her heart would break. 

To the old pain, the week-old pain, that seemed to have begun 
whole centuries before, there was now a new one added. He could 
contemplate the time when he might tire of her. 

Next, the pain would come when he had tired of her. 

&quot;Tired of her &quot; was an ugly phrase. It was not quite what he 
meant. She knew he was hers in some stronger bond than charm or 
beauty. 

But the atmosphere of his love would soon be too still and 
silent for him ; the beauty of it would jar when the longing for the 
little arm was strong on him. Then he would look at her critically, 




THE BOND, 55 

coldly, and wonder why her presence there no longer filled the 
rooms with radiance and a sense of rest. 

Day by day she lost her brightness, her quick capacity for 
laughter and warm responsiveness. Thought grew leaden with 
turning round and round in the one small place. There were cruel 
moments when her secret bit her like the Spartan&apos;s fox, but she 
smiled and forced herself to play her part — the part that some 
day must inevitably be disclosed as hollow. 

She forced herself to wander with him through all his tender 
imaginings ; she made herself respond to every scheme for the little 
one&apos;s happiness. 

&quot; When she is old enough we will take her to Italy, to Paris. 
How old ought she to be ? &quot; 

** We will take her when she is eight.&quot; 

Life altered again. A new revolution, and she saw that for 
herself she could bow to this blow, and some day even kiss the hand 
that dealt it. Her eyes had been opened, and selfishness, which 
is blindness, never could return. The mother-love that had been 
given to her so lavishly need never be wasted while the world 
stretched out around her, hungering everywhere for love. 

But her husband had gathered the little one in his arms so 
often that he almost believed she was there, blue-eyed and sunny- 
haired, with a mouth like a clover for sweetness. To know that 
such a child was never to be bom to them would be more bitter 
than to have Death take her from his arms. 

Down she went to the brink of the grave, playing the part 
gaily, tenderly all the while. Wondering with him how soon the 
good God would let them know of little Annie&apos;s coming, whispering 
to his whisper that the cling of the little arms was the sweetest 
thing in all the world. 

And only on the grave&apos;s brink, with Death staring like a 
hungry wolf into her face, and her heart too torn and wounded 
almost to resist, she told him. 

&quot;There never can be any little Annie.&apos;* 



56 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

And she told him she had known it many months. Told him 
that the knowledge, and the thought of the chasm that was to divide 
their lives, had been slowly killing her. Everything she laid bare 
to him, — all her pitiful little mockeries, her tender, sad deceits. 

Then she was ready to turn away and die. But the hungry 
wolf had seen the agony in the man&apos;s face, and fled, knowing its 
time was not yet. 

There, at her side, was the child for whom her mother-love 
might flow, this broken-hearted man, her husband.

COLLOFS MOTHER. 

HE was an ancient mariner, and of the old school, a fellow- 
passenger on s.s. Hauroto, Auckland to Sydney. We fore- 
gathered, refreshed together (he did n&apos;t take water in his), 
and subsequently conversed of many things — the way to set a fore- 
topmast stun&apos;sail ship-shape and Bristol fashion, religion, the 
superiority of sail to steam, education, blackbirding (he had been 
there), and, lastly, filial affection. 

&quot;I ain&apos;t wot you&apos;d call religious,&quot; he remarked, &quot;but I 
believes in a religious eddication. I don&apos;t hold with this yer new- 
fangled sekkilar system. I &apos;ve knocked about promiscuous, an&apos; I 
says early religious trainin&apos; is a first-chop thing. As for what you 
calls filliul affeckshun, I don&apos;t take no stock much in fathers — mine 
brought me up on holystone and rope&apos;s-end, dern him ! — but no 
chap &apos;s any good onless he &apos;s allfired fond of his mother. You take 
it from me.&quot; 

I acquiesced. 

&quot; Did you ever come across Bob Collop — Captain Collop, that 
is?&quot; he asked, with seeming irrelevance. 

I intimated that I had not the voluptuous pleasure of Mr. 
Collop&apos;s acquaintance. 

&quot; Well, he &apos;s a runnin&apos; down to the Islands just now, in the 
Martha and Emily schooner. Years ago me and him was sailin&apos; 
our own schooners on the Chinee coast, Ningpo to Shanghai. Lots 
of Australian chaps was on that lay then. Well, Collop he 
was an axample of early pious trainin&apos; an&apos; filliul affeckshun, 
an&apos; no bloomin&apos; error. No, there wasn&apos;t many as could touch 
Collop ! &quot; 

I hinted that a recital of the manifold virtues of Collop 

57 



58 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

might prove a means of grace to myself. And this was the story ol 
Collop — his piety and filial affection : — 

My name &apos;s Jof ul — John Joful. Collop was a saint, if ever was 
one. But you understand me, he was no God-forgot teetotaller. 
There were n&apos;t any — not at sea, at least — them days. He &apos;d take his 
tot reg&apos;lar and his religion did n&apos;t show out startling, only about 
once every four months, when he said he &apos;d got a letter from his 
poor old mother in Sydney. I never seed the letters, but I knowed 
when he had one, for he &apos;d go off on a reg&apos;lar religious rampage, so 
to speak. We would be lyin&apos; in the river and one of his China 
sailors &apos;d come aboard my craft with his teeth a-chatterin&apos; and pig- 
tail a-stickin&apos; out straight, and say : 

&quot; Claptin&apos;; you klum makee see Collop ; he catchee one piecee 
chopee flom his old muddee ; he makee too much bobelee, go lah ! &quot; 

Then I &apos;d know Collop was took bad with piety and filliul thing- 
ummy. I &apos;d take my boat and six Manila-men and a few fathom o&apos; 
new nine-thread, and pull for CoUop&apos;s hooker. Afore we reached her 
we &apos;d hear the firing ; we &apos;d pull straight down ahead, so &apos;s he 
could n&apos;t spot us coming, for he &apos;d be posted on the companion- 
ladder, half up and half down, with a loaded old smooth-bore 
a-restin&apos; on the hatch, and with no dunnage on him particular and 
his hair a-flyin&apos; loose in the breeze, and him six foot four, bare feet, 
and a fine figger of a man, and a-patiently waitin&apos; till something 
alive showed so &apos;s he could shoot at it. He mis liked heathen dreffuh 
when these pious fits was on him — bless you ! he &apos;d shoot a China- 
man, or a Malay, or a Manila-man, or a Lascar, or a buck nigger he 
suspicioned was n&apos;t Christianised, whenever he &apos;d heard from his 
poor old mother. That&apos;s how his what-d&apos;ye-call-it affeckshun and 
early trainin&apos; come out. But it showed the nat&apos;ral religion and 
goodness as was in him — did n&apos;t it, now ? 

I &apos;d fasten my painter to his anchor-chain, tell my Manila-men 
to stand by, shin up and sing out loud, &quot; All right, Collop, don&apos;t 
fire ! it &apos;s only me, Joful ! &quot; And I &apos;d dodge for&apos;ard of the foremast 




COLLOP&apos;S MOTHER. 59 

till I &apos;d d rawed his fire ;* then I &apos;d up stick and get aft, alongside of 
hira, afore he could load. 

He was always glad to see me, and he &apos;d go on loading, so &apos;s to 
be ready for anything as moved. I &apos;d say : 

&apos;&apos; Had a letter, Collop, old ship ? &quot; 

He &apos;d bust a-cryin&apos; and say : 

&quot; Yes, Joful — a letter from my poor old mo-mother, as taught 
me piety when I was an innercent nipper at her knee.&quot; 

And he &apos;d catch sight of some pagan heathen a-hidin&apos; behind a 
water-butt and — hang / &apos;d go his gun, and as he &apos;d run the rod 
through her he &apos;d cry gently to hisself and say : 

*&apos; Missed that yaller thief, Joful. Yes, Joful, it was my poor 
old mother as taught me all the goodness as I knows. And I gets 
a letter from her to-day, a beautiful letter, full of hymns and tex&apos;s 
and &quot; 

Then he *d slip, maybe, two bullets in. 

&quot; When I was a little, little kid a-dressed in my little velvet 
coat and lace, and my innercent little drawers with frills on &apos;em, 
she &apos;d fold my hands and teach me &quot; 

Bang ! would go his old gun again, and he &apos;d say quite sad and 
solemn : 

&quot; Another inch to the left, Joful, and I &apos;d a hit that fat-headed 
Chinese lowdah that don&apos;t know the difference between sou&apos;-east and 
nor&apos;-west — he don&apos;t, as you &apos;re a sinner, Joful, which you know you 
are, and a drunkard, which the same is cursed in the Book ! &quot; 

An&apos; byemby he &apos;d let her rip again. 

&quot;Oh ! Joful, you ain&apos;t got religion ; you can never know what 
it is to me.&quot; And he &apos;d fill her a quarter up with powder. 

&quot; Religion &apos;s all I have left ; but I &apos;m at peace, at peace with 
all men. Shove up that 300-yard sight for me, Joful ! There &apos;s 
something in that lorcha&apos;s riggin&apos;. &apos;Pears to me it &apos;s one of them 
Goa Portugese. Sinful Roman Catholics they are, them Goa men! &quot; 

And after he &apos;d fired that shot, and missed — which he did fre- 
quent — I &apos;d let a whoop out o&apos; me, and my Manila-men &apos;d come 
swarming over the bows, and we &apos;d run round and round poor 



60 TEE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Collop with the nine-thread, till we &apos;d tangle his legs and throw 
him, and a awful gay time we &apos;d have, that &apos;s a fact. We &apos;d bowse 
him below and lash him to his bunk, and take away all his guns an&apos; 
pistols an&apos; razors an&apos; carving knives, an&apos; I &apos;d sit alongside him and 
feed him with big spoons of brandy or squareface, and talk to him 
about his good old mother or read chice parts of Scripter — Jonah 
and the whale, and Paul&apos;s voyages, and all about the Ark, and Lot 
and the promises, an&apos; in two or three days these yer religious 
exercises, and a little opium as T give him, &apos;d pull him round. 

But it showed — did n&apos;t it ? — the effeck of early religious 
eddication ; because, you see, he always fired on them occasions with 
hally whereas if he &apos;d a-had no proper teachin&apos; he &apos;d &apos;ve loaded with 
ahot^ and that &apos;d &apos;ve scattered and hit something. It was just his 
mother&apos;s lessons. 

One night in Ningpo, he &apos;d &apos;ad one of them letters and was 
flamin&apos; bad. He came nigh killin&apos; the lot of us. The third day he 
saySj sudden : 

&quot; Joful, old blowhard, I &apos;d like to see a parson afore I die ! &quot; 

** You ain&apos;t as bad as that, Bob Collop ? &quot; I says. 

&quot;Joful,&quot; he answers, &quot;fetch me a sky-pilot afore 1 die.&quot; 

Well, he was dreffal weak and extra pious that morning, and I 
felt as if the angel of thingumybob was aboard. I sends a boy down 
to the mission-station — &apos;Merican Methodees, they was — to say as 
how Captain Collop was a-dyin&apos;, an&apos; to send a proper certificated 
sky-pilot — not a mud-hobbler — and, maybe, some physic. Towards 
sundown Collop got worse. Says I to myself : &quot;You &apos;re a-goin&apos; out 
with the tide, a-ebbin&apos; with the ebb. Bob Collop, that &apos;s what &apos;s the 
matter with you, an&apos; it &apos;s spring tides at that.&quot; 

Byemby a sampan sculls alongside, an&apos; in it a missionary cove 
— a little chap with a white &apos;elmet size of the bunt of a ship&apos;s 
mains&apos;l, and a rumberella set. Says he, very &apos;aughty and 
fierce : 

&quot; Is this the Wanderer, my good man ? &quot; 

&quot;You bet,&quot; says L 



)LLOFS MOTHER, 

Why is n&apos;t there a proper ladder rigged for me ? &quot; he sayi 
like a hadmiral. 

Finally we hoisted him on deck, and I p&apos;inted to where the 
dyin&apos; man were ; but when I wants to explain — to prepare him for 
CoUop and CoUop for him — he pushes me aside sayin&apos; we men was 
all the same, a lot of drunken brutes. And down he goes, stiff and 
grand. 

I looked down arter him ; there was CoUop, as I reckoned 
dyin&apos;, standin&apos; in the cabin, smilin&apos; beautiful. 

The little chap was very rough with poor Collop, orderin&apos; him 
around like as if he was a Christian converted Chinkie, and dis- 
remembering as Collop was master mariner, and he was only four 
foot odd, and Collop six foot and inches. An&apos; when Collop begins 
talkin&apos; about his poor old mother the little Methodee says : 

&quot; I don&apos;t want to &apos;ear that rubbidge. Pay me ten dollars, then 
I &apos;11 give you some medicine.&quot; 

CoUop&apos;s face turned kinder queer, but he planks the dollars, 
and the missionary he lugs out three powders in white paper, and 
says, a-curlin&apos; his nose : 

&quot; You &apos;11 take one of these now, one at eight, and one if you 
can&apos;t sleep.&quot; 

Says Collop — soft as a sou &apos;-east trade : 

&quot; Which will I take now f I &apos;11 take &apos;em for my poor old 
mother&apos;s sake.&quot; 

&quot; You stupid, maudlin fellow, never mind your mother ! You 
take one if you can&apos;t sleep, one at eight, and one now.&quot; 

Collop he smiled a faded smile and asks, poetical : &quot; Mate, 
which will I take at eight ? &quot; 

&quot; This man &apos;s an idiot,&quot; says the missionary. 

&quot; Which will I take if I can&apos;t sleep 1 &quot; asks Collop, sweet as 
East India sugar. &quot; Boss,&quot; he goes on, &quot; I &apos;d like to own a sky- 
pilot all to myself. What would a gent of your figger take an&apos; sign 
articles to be my regular chaplain ? &quot; 

&quot; This fellow &apos;s drunk and a fool,&quot; says the other, heavin&apos; his 
eyes aloft. 



62 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

An&apos; I see his &apos;and (Collop&apos;s &apos;and) go softly, slowly behind him, 
and afore I could move Collop&apos;s arm comes round dragging a great 
rug from off his bunk, and quicker &apos;n you could splice the mainbrace 
he had dumped the gospel -grinder in the centre of that blanket — 
white &apos;at, rumberella and all — and then he catches hold of the four 
corners, and ties up the parson inside just as you ties up dirty 
clothes for the dhobie to take to wash. Then he h&apos;ists the bundle 
on the cabin table, and as he sees me a-comin&apos; he just out a revolver 
as he &apos;ad &apos;id somehow and says solemn : 

&quot; No yer don&apos;t, Joful, onless you &apos;re weary, and then I will give 
you rest. Scrip ter, don&apos;t yer know.&quot; I saw he meant shoot, and so 
I waited. 

He turns to the bundle of missionary, opens the mouth of the 
blanket an inch or so, and says to what was inside : 

&quot; Chook ! Chook ! Chook ! &quot; Like as if he &apos;d a chicken in 
there. Then he says, &quot; You &apos;re my chaplain ! &quot; 

Then he made his chaplain take all them three powders, and 
orders : 

&quot; Chaplain, pray for me ! ** 

An&apos; the little chap begins to pray like mad, but whether for 
hisself or CoUop I could n&apos;t make out. After a time CoUop peeps 
into the parcel again an&apos; orders : 

&quot; Pray for my poor old mother, chaplain ! &quot; 

He prayed. 

&quot; Sing a hymn, chaplain ! &quot; 

He sang. 

&quot; Preach me a sermon, chaplain. Lots o&apos; &apos;ell-fire in it, please.&apos;* 

He preached. 

But by-an&apos;-by Collop would call him to prayers less frequent, 
and, at last, his head falls back an&apos; he dosses off like a tired hinfant. 
Down I dives, chucks the pistol through the port, out knife, an&apos; cuts 
the little gent adrift, an&apos; such a holy mix you never did see. I gives 
him a stiff second-mate&apos;s nip — four fingers up, believe me — an&apos; passes 
the little creature into his sampan. 

Next mornin&apos; Collop wakes up, fresh as paint. &quot; A just man 




COLLOFS MOTHER. 63 

made perfeck am I, Joful, you drunken old sinner ! &quot; — that &apos;s wot he 



But it all showed the goodness of his heart, an&apos; the good of 
early pious trainin&apos; an&apos; the inflooence of his mother — didn&apos;t it 
now ? Because, you know, if Collop had n&apos;t a had them yer things, 
he &apos;d &apos;ave killed that missionary — what do you say ? But not he, 
not Collop. He just made that little cove pray and preach for him 
like the Levide &apos;n the good Sammarium in the book. 

But there is one thing as puzzles me worse nor lograthims ; 
Collop did n&apos;t really have them letters from his mother ; because he 
did n&apos;t have no mother ; because he was a Sydney foundling — they 
picked him up, a babby, in a newspaper where Riley-street is now. 
Old Captain Slumley&apos;s wife took him and eddicated him with a 
rolling-pin ; an&apos; Slumley — cussing Slumley, they called him — did n&apos;t 
have no religion, nor she, except rum. Anyway, Collop was true 
pious, and full of what^d&apos;ye-call-it aflfeckshun and all that, and an 
axample to the demed young sekkilar larrikins as is box-hauling 
and buckin&apos; and fillin&apos; about Sydney now. 

Let &apos;s have a tot, a soldier&apos;s supper and turn in.

A BUSH TANQUERflY. 

THE coach creaked round a path hewn out of the grey sand- 
stone, leading to the road that ran white and bare over the 
summit of a hill. The driver pulled up. Away down in 
the smoke-laden hollow a number of men gathered and sent up a 
faint cheer. Then a shirt of many colours, supported by yellow 
moleskin trousers, rose solemnly from the box-seat and made some 
parabolic gestures in return. The driver touched his leader tenderly 
on the flank, and the coach wound through lichen-covered boulders 
into a dingy mulga background. Simultaneously the crowd below 
adjourned to the public-house. A mottle-faced old whaler peeped 
in at the door to remark, for the fifth time, that &quot;water was bad, 
and the road too stinkin&apos; for anything.&quot; No one noticed him until, 
pressed by a great thirst, he hazarded another cast of the die : 

&quot; Anybody want to &apos;ear a song — a real blanky song without 
funny business ? Ever &apos;eard &apos; When Molly marries the Ringer &apos; ? 
I&apos;d sing &apos;Billy the Bound&apos;ry,&apos; only I&apos;m gone in the &apos;igh notes 
through sleepin&apos; in the wet without a bluey.&quot; 

A derisive, withering reply sent him hobbling to the kerb to 
examine further the grey ridges that bounded an everlasting plain, 
and the question of his life — the road. Conversation in the bar 
turned upon Benjamin Stokes, the man who had just left by coach 
for Sydney. Everybody admitted that Ben was too reserved and 
sullen. In the first place, his life had been spent beyond the 
enlightening influence of his fellow-townsmen, in long night-watches 
with stamping herds and vicious colts. &quot; And the result,&quot; said 
Tackier, the school-master, &quot;is a product as rough as Nature, his 
god. Gentlemen,&quot; continued Tackier, seizing a gin-and-peppermint, 
*&apos; the man Stokes is a heathen idolater.&quot; 

64 



A BUSH TANQUERAY. 65 

And Mottle-face went lamely over the hill, his tattered clothes 
flapping weirdly through a vista of white dust. 

Ben&apos;s trip was to last a month, and each week of his absence 
was duly notched ofiF on the post outside the pub. When the 
notches grew to ten, and he did not return, the circumstance was 
referred to in the Deep Creek Watchman. 

Ben had never seen a train before ; his ideas of city life had 
been drawn from the rough word-pictures of bushmen. The cause 
of his prolonged absence was explained in the first page of his new 
pocket-book — 

Stoping two Teathj one ginny. Millysent Lee — cah — Mattry- 
monal ayenCy 3£. 28. 6d. 

One afternoon the coach dropped them at the door of a hut 
near the creek. The driver shook hands with Ben, winked at Ben&apos;s 
wife, and flogged his horses over the wooden bridge to the township. 
They stood watching the coach till attention was claimed by a tabby 
cat which brought out several blind kittens for inspection. Her 
sinful pride led to painful consequences, for a few minutes later the 
anxious mother mewed piteously near the tank, while Benjamin did 
strange things with her blind offspring in a bucket of water. 

Millicent threw herself wearily on a biscuit-box and slowly 
took out her hat-pins. The room was stuffy and dark ; the tiny 
window and the little tin mirror filled her with profound astonish- 
ment. In a corner was a narrow bed that met the requirements of 
a, long single man, and its presence plainly indicated that the whole 
wedlock business was unpremeditated. A sporting print on the 
wall depicted &quot; Jimmy the Biff &quot; going sweet and fresh after ten 
hard rounds with &quot; Mick the Nipper &quot; from Bendigo. 

Through a large hole in the wall near the fire-place Ben 
apologised for the speckled condition of the nuptial chamber — due, 
be explained, to the goats and fowls. By-and-by he might nail up 
the hole with a bag; it was getting too big. Some night an 
enterprising cow would squeeze through and breathe over a married 



65 TSS BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

couple — he&apos;d nail it up now. He rushed away, and there were 
sounds of a man chopping wood. 

The next day was Sunday. Ben took out a concertina from 
the hollow log where it had lain for weeks ; and, tucking it under 
his arm, stole down to the creek bend, where the belt of coolabahs 
would hide his musical proceedings from Mill. He began to wonder 
if she were really fond of music. Anyhow, he would practise a bit 
before submitting anything to her judgment. She had lived all her 
life in swell boarding-houses where the aristocracy sat down to the 
piano and gave it what for. He reckoned that Mill would be very 
hard to please ; still, a concertina was as good as a piano, and if he 
could only get hold of a few rattling tunes he &apos;d spring &apos;em on 
her suddenly — he &apos;d go marching up the track swinging his 
instrument over his head and filling the bush with an imitation of 
cathedral bells. His mother used to say he had a grand forehead 
for music. He looked back over his shoulder to see if Mill were 
watching him from the door. A screw of smoke trailed from the 
tiny chimney, winding like a scarf across the roof of the bush. 

How different the country seemed since he had returned ! The- 
blazed eucalypt that had always reminded him of a crucified man 
looked quite cheerful ; the cattle were in better condition ; the very 
atmosphere held some hidden witchery that set him aglow as if he 
had drunk wine from the billy instead of tea. 

He sat on a boulder hugging his concertina. The coming of 
this grey-eyed town-girl would change his life. There had been times, 
when he used to sit alone clasping his knees and smoking until he 
felt sick and giddy. People said he was sulkier than a calf. Yet 
there were hundreds of lads who lived as he had lived, with the 
unresponsive bush for a mistress and slavering, red-eyed cattle for 
comrades. 

The first few notes from his concertina seemed to wake the 
morning stillness ; a couple of inquisitive magpies chortled back 
melodiously as if defying the big sun-tanned stripling to out-clamour 
them. 



A BUSH TANQUERAY, (J7 

He rose suddenly and pitched a stone in their direction. &quot; Go 
way, yer bloomin&apos; cadgers ! yous sneak about when yous ain&apos;t 
wanted. Gerrout ! &quot; 

&quot; Ha^ ha, ha t ho, ho, Ao / &apos;* 

A kingfisher sailed over the hut roof and settled on the lower 
branch of a gum^ 

&quot;ffo, ho, ho/&quot; 

The savage, insulting laughter cracked discordantly along the 
hollow. 

For a moment the hot blood swam in Ben&apos;s cheeks ; the same 
bird had shed laughter a thousand times over his hut, but never till 
now had he felt how closely the cackle resembled the fierce mockery 
from a human throat. 

When he returned Mill was clearing out the garnered litter 
of his bachelor days — leaky, rust-eaten billies, old boots and 
bridle straps, fearsome pictures of groggy pugilists and bush 
racehorses. He whistled softly, with his body half in the door- 
way, wondering whether he had better take oflf his hat before 
entering. 

After breakfast Millicent hinted weakly about going to church. 
&quot; Right, Mill ! &quot; said Ben, dropping the saw he was greasing ; 
&quot; we &apos;11 go now, though I &apos;ve never been before. Put on your grey 
dress and the hat with the big black feather.&quot; 

He followed her inside. 

When they started, Ben walked ahead swinging his arras so 
that the shortness of his sleeves might not attract Mill&apos;s attention. 
For the first time in his life he took an interest in the long shadow 
that stretched about six fathoms ahead. In the middle of it was a 
hideous kink where the saddle had pressed his coat-tail outwards. 
The ridiculous shape of it hurt Ben beyond words. 

Mill panted after him — he was sublimely unconscious that his 
terrific pace distressed her. She caught his hand : he slackened 
instantly and blushed a peony red. 

The track swung over a hillock where the scattered cairns 



68 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

of pick-torn stone recalled a one-time mining camp. They rested 
awhile : Ben propped himself against a blue-gum. 

&quot; Yer git a good breeze here on hot nights, Mill. Grand place 
fer a breeze.&quot; 

She did not answer ; her fingers were shut over his, her parted 
lips drank the mountain air. 

The rocks filtered great drops of mouth-cooling water into their 
outstretched hands : the sun stalked valiantly across the naked East, 
over treeless gullies and rolling downs. Through the still scrub they 
caught the moving gleams of tawny light radiated from leaf to leaf 
into the deeps of ebon shadows. He touched her hand unconsciously, 
and the wanton blood leaped to her throat and temples. She looked 
at him, and he seemed to her a part of the big, secret Bush. The 
light of morning was in his eyes, a fierce young light that she had 
not seen in the eyes of men who lurked under gasaliers and crouched 
over desks. He was staring absently at the red cattle wallowing in 
the reed-choked lagoon. He turned suddenly; his long arm went 
out towards the tin-roofed box in the hollow. 

&quot; It ain&apos;t a flash place I &apos;ve brought yer to. Mill. Yer might 
ha&apos; done better.&quot; 

Mill tugged at her cheap gloves and laughed softly. &quot;Yer 
right, Ben, it ain&apos;t flash ; but, Lord ! we &apos;11 pull through.&quot; 

&quot; Course we will.&quot; He glanced at her stealthily, and noted 
the handful of shop violets tucked cunningly under the brim of her 
straw hat. There was n&apos;t a woman in the township who could fix 
violets over her little ear in the same way. He moistened his lips. 

&quot;We oughter be happy here. Mill,&quot; he said, &quot;seein&apos;it&apos;s me 
an&apos; you.&quot; 

&quot; Yes, Ben,&quot; she acquiesced. 

&quot;They&apos;re alright people in Pyers when you know &apos;em,&quot; went 
on Ben ; &quot; an&apos; they &apos;re bound to take to you — bein&apos; friendly with 
me, yer see.&quot; 

She rose and took his arm. &quot;0&apos; course, Ben.&quot; 

He stretched himself on his disengaged side and breathed 
lustily. The world seemed so young and glorious — it made his eyes 



A BUSH TANQUERAT, 09 

water. His voice trembled a little as he said, &quot;Yer wouldn&apos;t 
believe what a place this is fer a breeze.&quot; 
They moved onwards. 

He chose a seat directly under the pulpit. &quot; Keep yer &apos;ead 
agin the mahogany, Mill ; they 11 be dyin&apos; to see yer face when they 
come in ; don&apos;t let &apos;em ! &quot; 

The church at this time was empty : but it filled — filled to 
overflowing. &quot; Don&apos;t forgit the mahogany. Mill ! &quot; whispered Ben 
behind his hand. 

Their pew remained as sacred as a Hindu cow. The coach- 
driver pointed them out from a crowded porch, and his audience 
appeared spasmodically grateful for the information concerning 
Mrs. Ben. The driver admitted regretfully that his friend, Sam 
Hopkins, knew her pretty well, thanks — &quot; wished I knew her as 
well.&quot; Still, it wasn&apos;t for him to take away the character of a 
respectable married woman. Heard that she could cook as good a 

feed as anybody in Pyers, and if The organ took it up, and 

sent out a moaning &quot; Adeste Fideles.&quot; 

The minister thundered at his stoic congregation, and charged 
the air with strange, charitable precepts. At the end he waved a 
calm benediction over his respectable flock : &quot; Go in peace, and sin 
no more ! &quot; 

The men leered at Ben and Mill as they passed out ; young 
girls gathered up skirts and scattered ; obese wives and mothers 
cannoned in circling, agitated groups. 

&quot; Thank Grod the roof didn&apos;t fall on us this blessed day ! The 
idea ! &quot; 

Ben lifted his head and eyed the hostile gathering ; some of 
them had known him for years — since the time when he used to 
drive about Pyers in a billy-goat tandem. A shout of mocking 
laughter followed them to the gate. Ben clinched his mouth ; an 
unknown shame spread to his neck and face : something gripped his 
arm, and a word hummed in his ear that an ordinary woman never 
uses at any period of her life. 



70 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

So they tramped along, voiceless and sullen, through paddocks 
where flowers nodded to a caressing wind, while the sun drew 
perfumes from the moist Spring earth. Mill&apos;s right hand bruised 
her breast savagely ; the other held his sleeve. 

She glanced furtively at him across the room — his head down, 
his chin resting in the heel of his palm. 

&quot;Did I ever say I was a good girl, Ben? I ain&apos;t, Gawd 
&apos;elp me! &quot; 

She thrust herself beside him, shaking and trembling. Then 
Benjamin Stokes listened, almost for the first time in his life, to the 
commonest story in the world — a betrayal, a little shame, a gradual 
hardening, a world-defiance. 

&quot; The old woman at the boardin&apos;-house said she &apos;d clear me out 
unless I was obligin&apos; and civil to the gentlemen. So there were 
presents for Mill, and gloves planted in my bed ... It all 
helped to take my head away from the damned &apos;ard scrubbin&apos;. I 
ain&apos;t old — nineteen ain&apos;t very old, is it ? Gimme a chance, Ben — 
gimn\e a chance ! &quot; 

Something simmered in the fireplace ; plates clattered ; a 
shadowy girl moved about him all the afternoon in a dull, half- 
frightened way. He stumbled outside to the wood-heap, and the 
soft-eyed collie hung at his heels for a word. 

The sun dropped to the edge of the plains, drenching the far-off 
hills with yellow mist. A rush of cool air brought the clang of 
bells ; he raised a rough and haggard face and spoke a word to the 
night — a word he used when punching cattle through an overflow. 
The dog fawned joyously . . . &quot;Away, you beast!&quot; — ai»d a 
savage kick sent it howling down the track. 

A candle flickered in the little bedroom, throwing a shape 
across the chintz curtain. &quot; That bell again ! &quot; He walked a short 
distance from the house. How everyone knew! How everyone 
guessed the truth! What had happened at the church to-day 
would happen again with sickening regularity. He might force the 




A BUSH TANQUERAY. 71 

men to respect him with his fists ; but that cackling brood in the 
porch ! 

He struck a match and groped into the room to fling a word 
of hate at this Magdalen — and fell into a chair, silenced. 
The face was so pretty, so weak — prey for every libertine. The 
minister had said something about a woman who wiped the feet of 
Christ with her long meshes of hair ; nobody believed it, of course ; 
if they did, why was Mill treated as she had been ? He sat through 
the long night, heavy-browed and brooding, until a grey light from 
the east whitened the window-pane. 

&quot; Mill ! &quot; She smiled sleepily at the word. 

&quot; Mill ! &quot; The sound of his voice made her crouch on the rough 
pallet ; she stared at the white, haggard face in the half-light. 

&quot; Don&apos;t be frightened. Mill ! — don&apos;t be frightened ; I shan&apos;t hit 
yer. I &apos;ve been thinkin&apos; ; and we ain&apos;t goin&apos; to church again to let 
&apos;em worry us. I &apos;11 build another place over at Red Point on the 
hundred-acre patch ; if they come there to carry on I &apos;11 be about to 
receive &apos;em.&quot; 

Her face was hidden from him, but her hand crept into hig 
big palm. 

A few hours later Ben led a bay horse to the front and hopped 
into the saddle. She came to the door, her white arms splashed 
with milk and flour. 

&quot; It &apos;s a long way to the Point, ain&apos;t it, Ben ? ** 

&quot; Yeh ! &quot; 

She stole nearer — obviously to examine the horse. He threw 
himself forward and kissed her on the lips. 

Albert Dorrington. 



BASHER&apos;S HURRICANE. 

A STONISHMENT is a word which faintly expresses the feeling 
AA of the ship&apos;s company when we learnt that Captain Basher 
had married. And when we saw the lady the puzzle grew 
harder than ever. She had been a Mrs. M&apos;Cluskie — and looked it. 
Tall, bony, red, and freckled, with eyes the colour of galvanised iron, 
and teeth which would not have disgraced a small elephant — she 
was the finest sample of the unadulterated female porridge-eater 
that ever I clapped eyes on. She was to sail with us, too. We 
trembled. 

It turned out that the captain had married her for the sake of 
the late M&apos;Cluskie&apos;s money, and during the first half of that voyage 
he earned every penny of it. The ex-widow ruled the ship from the 
first moment she put her prunella-shod foot aboard us. Basher, the 
rollicking dare-devil, was tamed to the demeanour of a mouse. His 
wife was as pious as she was prudish, and she was as prudish as a 
prayer-meeting full of old maids. Basher shivered in his com- 
plaisance. He cufied an ordinary seaman for unwittingly applying 
its proper name to a certain portion of the topsail brace-block. The 
coppered part of the vessel was always alluded to in the lady&apos;s 
presence as *&apos;the underneath part &quot;; and the belly of a sail was spoken 
of apologetically, with bated breath. On Mrs. B.&apos;s washing days, it 
was sacrilege to look over the counter, for the more essentially 
feminine of her garments were hung to dry from a sort of &quot;parshee- 
boom,&quot; rigged from the stern ports, and secure from the irreverent 
gaze of the rude sailor-man. 

Basher lived two lives. With Mrs. B. below, he was his own 
profane self ; with Mrs. B. on deck, it was &quot; Mr. Brown, kindly 
step for&apos;ard, and ascertain if the fore-to&apos;-gallant-mast is sufficiently

stayed,&quot; — or &quot; Bo&apos;s&apos;n, please inform the hands that to-morrow, being 
the Sabbath, Divine service will be held in the saloon, as usual &quot;— . 
ye gods ! The strain on Basher must have been awful. 

We were somewhere about the 50th parallel of latitude, having 
had to go farther to the southward than usual to look for wind, 

when Captain Basher rose in revolt. &quot; This is too d d fine a 

passage, Mr. Brown,&quot; he explained confidentially as he arranged his 
plan of campaign ; &quot; an&apos; I guess, if we don&apos;t assist the blanky course 
of Nature, I &apos;11 never live to see port. So — to-morrow night ! &quot; 

The next night came, starlit and beautiful. The weather 
being decidedly cold, Mrs. Basher had retired early to her bunk. 
There was a big swell ; and the vessel was brought beam-on to it. 
The dead-lights, previously loosened by the carpenter, were removed 
from the deck above the cabin in which the lady slumbered, and a 
length of hose was led to reach from the &quot; Down ton &quot; pump, at 
which four vigorous seamen waited eagerly for the order to &quot; shake 
her up.&quot; A couple of hands were stationed on the half-round, 
with draw-buckets. 

The ship was rolling terribly, scooping it up over both rails, 
and threatening to sling the sticks out of her. Captain Basher 
arrived on deck in a hurry, having locked his lady-love in her berth. 

&quot; Now, then, my lads, let her have it ! &quot; he said, and we did. 
That pump was never worked as it was wo-ked that night, and the 
water poured in at the deck, whilst the men with the draw-buckets 
kept up a terrific broadside of cold salt-water through the open 
ports. The rest of the watch were employed with handspikes in 
thundering on the deck above Mrs. B.&apos;s head. Basher at intervals 
bellowed orders of a heroic nature, whilst an apprentice and I kept 
the little brass signal-gun going till she got too hot to use. 

Every few minutes our gallant captain would rush below to the 
door of the cabin. &quot; Be brave, Jessie, my love, and remain where 
you are ! We may yet weather this awful storm,&quot; — he would roar 
through the keyhole ; or, &quot; Do not abandon hope, my dear beloved 
wife ! the hurricane is now on our weather bow ; but trust in God 



74 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

and your William, and remember everything depends on your 
keeping cool.&quot; (Poor Mrs. B. was in all conscience cool enough.) 
Then, deaf to her screams to be liberated, Basher would rush on 
■deck again to exhort us to further exertion. 

We kept it up for two hours, when the captain gave orders to 
•** ease up handsomely,&quot; and on things being made shipshape, the 
vessel was brought to her course again. Basher, having donned his 
oilskin and a life-belt, was pumped on to clinch the realism, and 
went below to his affrighted spouse, who was by this time more dead 
than alive. 

We made the Cape ten days afterwards, and Mrs. B. did not 
•continue the voyage with us, preferring to take steam to Plymouth. 
That was ten years ago, and the lady has never forgotten the horrors 
of that awful night. Captain Basher is living on her money some- 
where Deptford way, .secure from hurricanes and similar perils, for 
his wife will not hear of him going to sea again, with or without 
her.

THE DROVER&apos;S WIFE. 

THE house contains two rooms ; is built of round timber, 
slabs, and stringy bark, and floored with split slabs. A 
big bark kitchen stands at the end, and is larger than the 
liouse itself, verandah included. 

Bush all round ; bush with no horizon, for the country is flat. 
Ko ranges in the distance. The bush consists of stunted, rotten 
native apple trees. No undergrowth. Nothing to relieve the 
eye, save the darker green of a few she-oaks which are sighing 
Above the narrow, almost waterless creek. Nineteen miles to the 
nearest sign of civilisation — a shanty on the main road. 

The drover — an ex-squatter — is away with sheep. His wife 
And children are left here alone. 

The children are playing about the house — four of them, ragged 
And dried-up looking. Suddenly one yells : &quot; Snake ! Mother, 
here &apos;s a snake ! &quot; 

The gaunt, sun-browned bushwoman darts from the kitchen, 
snatches &quot; the baby &quot; from the ground, holds it on her left hip, and 
reaches for a stick. 

&quot;Where is it r&apos; 

&quot; Here ! gone into the wood-heap ! &quot; yells the eldest boy — a 
sharp-faced, excited urchin of eleven. &quot; Stop there, mother ! I &apos;11 
have him. Stand back ! I &apos;11 have the beggar ! &quot; 

&quot; Tommy, come here, or you &apos;11 be bit. Come here at once 
when I tell you, you little wretch ! &quot; 

The youngster comes reluctantly, carrying a stick bigger than 
himself. Suddenly he yells, triumphantly : 

&quot; There it goes — under the house ! &quot; and darts away with club 
uplifted. At the same time, the big, black, yellow-eyed dog-of-all-

breeds, who has shown the greatest interest in the proceedings, 
breaks his chain and darts after that snake. He is a moment late^ 
however, and his nose reaches the crack in the slabs just as the end 
of the snake&apos;s tail disappears. Almost at the same moment the 
boy&apos;s club comes down and skins the aforesaid nose. The dog takes 
small notice of this, and proceeds to undermine the building ; but 
he is subdued after a struggle, and chained up. They can&apos;t afford 
to lose him. 

The drover&apos;s wife makes the children stand together near the 
dog-house while she watches for the snake. She gets two small 
dishes of milk, and sets them down near the wall to tempt the snake 
out ; but an hour goes by, and it does not show itself. 

It is near sunset, and a thunderstorm is coming. The children 
must be brought inside. She will not take them into the house, for 
she knows the snake is there, and may at any moment come up 
through a crack in the rough slab floor. So she carries several 
armfuls of firewood into the kitchen, and then takes the children 
there. The kitchen has no floor, or rather an earthen one, called 
a &quot;ground floor&quot; in this part of the bush. There is a large,, 
roughly-made table in the centre. She brings the children in 
and makes them get on this table. They are two boys and two girls 
— mere babies. She gives them some supper, and then, before it 
gets dark, she goes into the house, and snatches up some pillows and 
bed-clothes — expecting to see or lay her hand on the snake any 
moment. She makes a bed on the kitchen table for the children^ 
and sits down beside it to watch all night. 

She has an eye on the corner, and a green sapling club laid in 
readiness on the dresser by her side ; also, her sewing-basket and a 
copy of the Young Ladies^ Journal. She has brought the dog 
into the room. 

Tommy turns in under protest, and says he &apos;11 lie awake all 
night and smash that blinded snake. 

His mother asks him how many times she has told him not to 
swear. 



THE DROVER&apos;S WIFE. 77 

He has his club with him under the bed-clothes, and the child 
next to him protests : 

&quot; Mummy ! Tommy &apos;s skinnin&apos; me alive wiv his club ! Make 
him take it out ! &quot; 

Tommy : &quot; Shet up, you little ! D &apos;yer want to be bit 

with the snake ? &quot; 

Jacky shuts up. 

&quot; If yer bit,&quot; says Tommy, after a pause, &quot; you &apos;11 swell up, an* 
«mell, an&apos; turn red an&apos; green an&apos; blue all over till yer bust. Won&apos;t 
he, mother ? &quot; 

&quot; Now then, don&apos;t frighten the child. Go to sleep,&quot; she says. 

The two younger children go to sleep, and now and then Jacky 
complains of being &quot;skeezed.&quot; More room is made for him. 
Presently Tommy says : &quot; Mother ! listen to them (adjective) little 
&apos;possums. I &apos;d like to screw their blanky necks.&quot; 

And Jacky protests drowsily : 

&quot; But they don&apos;t hurt us, the little blanks ! &quot; 

Mother : &quot; There, I told you you &apos;d teach Jacky to swear.&quot; 
But Jacky&apos;s remark makes her smile. Jacky goes to sleep. 

Presently, Tommy asks : 

&quot; Mother ! Do you think they &apos;11 ever &apos;sterminate the (adjective) 
kangaroos ? &quot; 

&quot; Lord ! How am I to know, child ? Go to sleep.&apos;* 

&quot; Will you wake me if the snake comes out 1 &quot; 

&quot;Yes. Go to sleep.&quot; 

Near midnight. The children are asleep and she sits there 
still, sewing and reading by turns. From time to time she glances 
round the floor and wall-plate, and whenever she hears a noise she 
reaches for the stick. The thunderstorm comes on, and the wind, 
rushing through the cracks in the slab wall, threatens to blow out 
her candle. She places it on a sheltered place of the dresser, and 
fixes up a newspaper to protect it. At every flash of lightning, the 
cracks between the slabs gleam like polished silver. The thunder 
rolls, and the rain comes down in torrents. 



78 TEE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

Alligator (the dog) lies at full length on the floor, with his 
eyes turned towards the partition. She knows by this that the 
snake is there. There are huge cracks in that wall, opening under 
the floor of the dwelling-house. 

She is not a coward, but recent events have shaken her nerves. 
A little son of her brother-in-law was lately bitten by a snake, and 
died. Besides, she has not heard from her husband for six months, 
and is anxious about him. 

He was a drover, and started squatting here when they were 
married. The drought of 18 — ruined him. He had to sacrifice 
the remnant of his flock and go droving again. He intends to move 
his family into the nearest town when he comes back, and, in the 
meantime, his brother, who lives on the main road, comes over 
about once a month with provisions. The wife has still a couple of 
cows, one horse, and a few sheep. The brother-in-law kills one of 
the latter occasionally, gives her what she needs of it, and takes the 
rest in return for other provisions. 

She is used to being left alone. She once lived like this for 
eighteen months. As a girl, she built the usual air-castles, but all 
her girlish hopes and aspirations are dead. She finds all the excite- 
ment and recreation she needs in the Young Ladies^ Journal^ and 
— Heaven help her ! — takes a pleasure in the fashion-plates. 

Her husband is an Australian, and so is she. He is careless, 
but a good enough husband. If he had the means, he would take 
her to the city and keep her there like a princess. They are used 
to being apart, or at least she is. &quot; No use frettin&apos;,&quot; she says. He 
may forget sometimes that he is married ; but if he has a good 
cheque when he comes back, he will give most of it to her. When 
he had money, he took her to the city several times — hired a rail- 
way sleeping-compartment, and put up at the best hotels. He also 
bought her a buggy ; but they had to sacrifice that along with the 
rest. 

The last two children were born in the bush — one while her 
husband was bringing a drunken doctor, by force, to attend to her. 
She was alone on this occasion, and very weak. She had been ill 



THE DROVER&apos;S WIFE. 7^ 

with a fever. She prayed to God to send her assistance. God sent 
Black Mary — the &quot;whitest &quot; gin in all the land. 

One of her children died while she was here alone. She rode 
nineteen miles for assistance, carrying the dead child. 

It must be near one or two o&apos;clock. The fire is burning low. 
Alligator lies -wdth his head resting on his paws, and watches the 
wall. He is not a very beautiful dog to look at, and the light shows 
numerous old wounds where the hair will not grow. He is afraid of 
nothing on the face of the earth, or under it. He will tackle a 
bullock as readily as he will tackle a flea. He hates all other dog&amp;— except kangaroo dogs — and has a marked dislike to friends or 
relations of the family. They seldom call, however. He sometimes 
makes friends with strangers. He hates snakes, and has killed 
many, but he will be bitten some day, and die ; most snake-dogs 
end that way. 

Now and then the bushwoman puts down her work, and 
watches, and listens, and thinks. She thinks of things in her own 
life, for there is little else to think about. 

The rain will make the grass grow, and this reminds her how 
she fought a bush-fire once, while her husband was away. The grass 
was long, and very dry, and the fire threatened to burn her out. 
She put on an old pair of her husband&apos;s trousers, and beat out the 
flames with a green bough till great drops of sooty perspiration 
stood out on her forehead and ran in streaks down her blackened 
arms. The sight of his mother in trousers greatly amused Tommy, 
who worked like a little hero by her side ; but the baby howled 
lustily to be taken up, and the fire would have mastered her but for 
four excited bushmen, who arrived in the nick of time. It was a 
mixed-up affair all round. When she went to take up the baby he 
screamed and struggled convulsively, thinking it was a &quot;black 
man &quot;; and Alligator, trusting more to the child&apos;s sense than his 
own instinct, charged furiously, and (being old and slightly deaf) did 
not in his excitement at first recognise his mistress&apos;s voice, but 
continued to hang on to the moleskins until choked off&quot; by Tommy

with a saddle-strap. The dog&apos;s sorrow for the mistake, and his 
anxiety to let it be known that it was all a mistake, were aa evident 
as his ragged tail and a six-inch grin could make them. It was a 
glorious time for the boys ; a day to look back to, and talk about, 
iind laugh over for many years. 

She thinks how she fought a flood during her husband&apos;s 
absence. She stood for hours in the drenching downpour, and dug 
a. drain to save the dam across the creek. But she could not save 
it. There are things that a bushwoman cannot do. Next morning 
the dam was broken, and her heart was nearly broken too, for she 
thought how her husband would feel when he came home and saw 
the result of months of labour swept away. She &quot; cried &quot; then. 

She also fought &quot;the pleuro,&quot; dosed and bled the few 
remaining cattle, and wept again when her two best cows died. 

Again, she fought a mad bullock that besieged the house for a 
day. She made bullets and fired at him through cracks in the 
slabs, with an old shot-gun. He was dead in the morning. She 
skinned him, and afterwards got seven-and -sixpence for the hide. 

She also fights the crows and eagles that have designs on her 
chickens. Her plan of campaign is very original. The children cry 
^* Crows, mother ! &quot; and she rushes out and aims a broom-stick at 
the birds, as though it were a gun, and says &quot; Bung I &quot; The crows 
leave in a hurry ; they are cunning, but a woman&apos;s cunning is 
greater. 

Occasionally a bushman in the horrors, or a villainous-looking 
sundowner, comes and scares the life out of her. She generally 
tells the suspicious-looking stranger that &quot;My husband and two sons 
are at work below the dam,&quot; for he always cunningly enquires for 
&quot; the boss.&quot; 

Only last week a gallows-faced swagman — having satisfied him- 
self or been informed that there were no men on the place — threw 
his swag down on the verandah, and demanded &quot; tucker.&quot; She gave 
him something to eat, and he expressed his intention of staying 
for the night It was sundown then. She got a batten from the 
sofa, loosened the dog, and confronted the stranger — holding the 



THE DROVER&apos;S WIFE, 81 

batten in one hand and the dog&apos;s collar with the other. &quot; Now, 
you go I &quot; she said. He looked at her and at the dog, and said, 
&quot; All right, mum,&quot; in a cringing tone, and left. She was a 
determined-looking woman, and Alligator&apos;s yellow eyes glared 
unpleasantly. Besides, the dog&apos;s chawing-up apparatus seemed 
not unlike a real alligator&apos;s. 

She has few pleasures to think of as she sits here alone by the 
fire, on guard against a snake. All days are much the same to her ; 
but on Sunday afternoons she dresses herself, tidies the children, 
smartens up baby, and goes for a lonely walk along the bush-track, 
pushing an old perambulator in front of her. She does this every 
Sunday. She takes as much care to make herself and her children 
&quot; look smart,&quot; as she would if she were going to &quot; do the block &quot; in 
Sydney. There is nothing to see, however, and not a soul to meet. 
You may walk for twenty miles along this track without being 
able to fix a point in your mind, unless you are a bushman. This is 
because of the maddening, everlasting sameness of the stunted trees 
— that monotony which makes a new-chum long to break away and 
travel as far as trains can go, and sail as far as ships can sail, and 
farther. 

But this bushwoman is used to the loneliness of it. As a girl- 
wife she hated it, but now she would feel strange away from it. 

She is glad when her husband returns, but she does not gush 
or make a fuss about it. She gets him something good to eat, and 
tidies up the children. 

She seems contented with her lot. She loves her children, but 
has no time to show it. She seems harsh to them. Her surroundings 
are not favourable to the development of the &quot; womanly &quot; or senti- 
mental side of her nature. 

It must be near morning now, but the clock is in the other 

room. Her candle is nearly done ; she forgot that she was 

out of candles. Some more wood must be got to keep the fire up, 

so she shuts the dog inside and hurries round to the wood-heap. 

F 



82 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

The rain has cleared off. She seizes a stick, pulls it out, and — • 
crash ! the whole pile collapses, and nearly frightens her to death. 

Yesterday she bargained with a stray blackfellow to bring her 
some wood, and while he was at work she went in search of a 
missing cow. She was absent an hour or so, and the black made 
good use of his time. On her return she was astonished to see a 
great heap of wood by the chimney. She gave the black an extra 
fig of tobacco, and praised him for not being lazy. He thanked her, 
and left with head erect. But he had built the wood-heap hollow. 

She is hurt now, and tears spring to her eyes as she sits down 
again by the table. She snatches up a handkerchief to wipe the 
tears away, but pokes her eyes with her bare fingers instead. The 
handkerchief is full of holes, and she finds that she has put her 
thumb through one and her forefinger through another. 

This makes her laugh suddenly, to the surprise of the dog. She 
has a keen, very keen sense of the ridiculous ; and, some time or 
another, she will amuse bushmen by relating this incident. Often 
she has told how one day she sat down &quot; to have a good cry,&quot; as she 
said — and the old cat rubbed against her dress and &quot; cried too.&apos;&apos; 
Then she « had to laugh.&quot; 

Now it is near daylight. The room is very close and hot 
because of the fire. Alligator still watches the wall from time to 
time. Suddenly he becomes greatly interested ; he draws himself a 
few inches nearer the partition, and a thrill runs through his body. 
The hair on the back of his neck begins to bristle, and the battle- 
light is in his yellow eyes. She knows what this means, and lays 
her hand on the stick. The lower end of one of the partition slabs 
has a large crack on each side of it. An evil pair of small, bright, 
bead-like eyes glistens at one of these holes The snake — a black 
one—&lt;Jomes slowly out, about a foot, and moves its head up and 
down The dog lies still, and the woman sits as one fascinated. 
The snake comes out a foot further. She lifts her stick, and the 
reptile, as though suddenly aware of danger, sticks his head in 
through the crack on the other side of the slab, and hurries to get 



THE DR0VER*8 WIFE. 83 

his tail round after him. Alligator springs, and his jaws come 
together with a snap. He misses this time, for his nose is large, 
and the snake&apos;s body is close down in the angle formed by the slab 
and the floor. He snaps again as the tail comes round. He has the 
snake now, and tugs it out eighteen inches. Thud f thud I comes the 
woman&apos;s club on the ground. Alligator pulls again. Thud! thud/ 
Alligator pulls some more. He has the snake out now — a black 
brute, five feet long. The head rises to dart about, but the dog has 
the enemy close to the neck. He is a big, heavy dog, but as quick 
as a terrier. He shakes the snake as though he felt the original curse 
in common with mankind. The eldest boy wakes up, seizes his 
stick, and makes to get out of bed, but his mother forces him back 
with a grip of iron. Thud ! thud ! the snake&apos;s back is broken in 
several places. Thud I thud / the head is crushed, and Alligator&apos;s 
nose skinned again. 

The woman lifts the mangled reptile on the point of her stick, 
carries it to the fire and throws it in. Then she piles on the wood, 
and watches the snake burn. The boy and dog watch, too. She 
lays her hand on the dog&apos;s head, and all the fierce, aogry light dies 
out of his yellow eyes. The younger children are quieted, and 
presently go to sleep. The dirty-legged boy stands for a moment in 
his shirt, watching the fire. Presently he looks at her. He sees 
the tears in her eyes, and, suddenly throwing his arms round her 
neck, exclaims : 

&quot; Mother, I won&apos;t never go drovin&apos; ; blast me if I do ! &quot; 
And she hugs him to her worn-out breast and kisses him, and 
they sit thus together while the sickly daylight breaks over 
the bush.

A NIGHT AT KELLY&apos;S. ^ 

IT looked like rain as I got ofi&apos; the -c oach. Leaving my bags and 
rug on the road, I climbed the hillside, on which Pat Kelly&apos;s 

pub. was fastened in some mysterious way that kept it from 
being blown over by the tornadoes which rushed up and down the 
narrow cleft between the hills. 

Arrived on the verandah, I said to the landlord, &quot; Those are 
my bags at the foot of the hill.&quot; The information did not seem to 
interest him much, as he made no reply, but went into the bar and 
began rubbing a dirty glass with a dirty towel, as if expecting an 
order ; also, he wiped his sore eyes with that towel. No business 
eventuating, he called a servant to show me a room. 

While waiting, I noticed that the passage was sprinkled with 
straw and stable litter, which the wind had blown in at the back door 
and had not strength to blow out at the front, so the refuse lay there 
waiting for the next squall. A crowd of dirty, bare-legged cbUdren 
ran about, crying and fighting, and, as I stood in the passage, a lady 
with a fat, bloated face and swollen eyelids came to a bedroom-door 
and looked at me with that serious intentness assumed by most 
drunken people when trying to appear perfectly sober. I was not 
sure whether she was my hostess until she clouted one or two of the 
howling children in an absent sort of way, as if it were a matter of 
habit. After this she shut the door with a lofty look that seemed 
to say she thought it would be unladylike to speak to me without 
an introduction. 

The servant now appeared, a fat girl, with uncombed 
hair and bare feet. Her dress was open for two or three 
hooks at the neck, and, as if that did not display her charms 
sufficiently, there was a spacious rent above the collar-bone. She 



A NIGHT AT KELLY&apos;S, g5 

showed me to my room with many smirks and coquettish looks, and 
— though her dress reached only to her ankles, and had a placket- 
gap three inches across — grabbed a handful of it at the back 
and lifted it up, after the fashion of a lady crossing a muddy 
street. 

By this time it was raining heavily, and I congratulated myself 
on being housed for the night. After half-an-hour I thought of 
something I wanted in my bags, but, on going to the room, they 
were nowhere to be found. I then went to the bar and asked 
Kelly. He looked astonished : 

&quot; Bags, is it ? Shure I dunno ; barrin&apos; they &apos;re wher&apos; ye lift 
thim.&quot; 

&quot; But why were they not brought in 1 &quot; 

&quot; Ye niver said annythin&apos; about wantin&apos; thim in.*&apos; 

&quot;But I told you where they were.&quot; 

&quot; Yis, ye did ; but I fought ye only mintioned it t&apos; make the 
conversation interestin&apos; loike. But hould an ; I &apos;11 call Mike. . . . 
Mick I Mickee ! ! &quot; he shouted ; but there was no response. &quot; Ah, 
niver moint ; I &apos;11 sind him for thim bine-boi. He &apos;11 be af ther 
gettin&apos; the cows now.&quot; And, as if the matter were finally settled, 
he languidly wiped another glass. 

Not being willing to wait, I went out through the driving rain 
and brought up my sodden properties. As I climbed the slippery 
bank, I heard loud peals of laughter above me, and, looking up, 
saw a girl about seventeen who was evidently enjoying my struggles 
with the luggage and the mud. She was the landlord&apos;s daughter — 
as she told me after she had laughed sufficiently at the appearance of 
the wet luggage. Her name was Gladys Ethel, and, even in this 
house of wild disorder, she was a unique figure. Jet-black masses 
of tangled, touzled hair fell upon her shoulders and straggled over 
her face. Her mane had probably never been combed, and nothing 
but a garden rake would have gone through it Her face was dirty, 
and the unlaced boots that hung on her unstockinged feet had the 
tongues hanging out, while the laces went clickety-clack as she 
stamped along the echoing floor. Large teeth, a loose, thick-lipped. 



86 VBE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

open mouth, and large, staring blue eyes completed Gladys Ethel&apos;s 
outward personality. 

I fled to my room to wait for tea, but when it came, it was not 
an unmixed joy. Pat Kelly stood at the head of the table clashing 
a knife and fork together with a sound like a broadsword combat. 
In front of him were corned and roast beef, and, as I came in, he 
was shouting loudly, &quot; Now then, ye chaps ; come in to tay, or divil 
a bite ye 11 get.&quot; Mrs. Kelly, whose only toilette had been evidently 
a couple of &quot; snifters,&quot; sat at her husband&apos;s right, and was com- 
porting herself with much dignity. As Pat carved the food he 
cried out, &quot; Now, what 11 ye hov, misther ? Cornbaf e or mate ? &quot; 
but Mrs. Kelly corrected him sharply : 

&quot; Pat Kelly, why d &apos;ye be comincin&apos; to ate like wan o&apos; thim 
blackfellys ? &quot;Why the divil don&apos;t ye be afther puttin&apos; the Crass o&apos; 
Christ an the beautiful mate ye have f orninst ye ? Annybuddy &apos;d 
think ye wuz brung up like a haythen, so they wud. Put an the 
Crass o&apos; Christ this minit, I tell ye, Pat Kelly ! &quot; 

&quot; Och, I can&apos;t be bothered ; let thim that wants put it an 
the&apos;rselves.&quot; But Mrs. Kelly&apos;s company manners were not satisfied 
until Pat mumbled a &quot;grace&quot; — &quot;For what we are about to resave&quot; 
— &quot; Daddy, make Johnny kape still ; he wants to go out an&apos; play 
futball &quot; — &quot; may the Lord make us &quot; — &quot; Ye &apos;re a liar ! &quot; said Johnny, 
in reply to the football accusation — &quot; Amin. If ye don&apos;t kape quite, 
ye divil, I &apos;11 trow the kyarvin&apos;-knife at the head o&apos; yez ! &quot; 

Then the feeding began. Mick, who had got back with the 
cows, sat next me. He was aged, deaf, and dilapidated, and he 
shovelled his food into his mouth with a knife and a stolid deter- 
mination to lose no time Utterly oblivious of what was going on 
around him, he did not hear Reginald Kelly, aged five, saying, 
&quot; Mick, my soup too &apos;ot.&quot; Mick took no notice, so the boy, to prove 
his words, ladled up a spoonful, and held it to the old man as a 
sample, but it spilled down his shirt-front. Again the boy said, 
&quot; Mickee, my soup too &apos;ot,&quot; and held out another spoonful, which 
was spilt also. At last the hot soup penetrated the old man&apos;s clothing. 



A NIGHT AT KELLY&apos;S. 87 

and, looking down, he discovered the boy giving him a soup bath. A 
sounding whack sent Reginald to the floor, and the veteran resumed 
his shovelling unmoved till the boy came at him under the table and 
bit his leg. Mick replied to this with a terrific kick, and Reginald 
was led howling away by Gladys Ethel, who promised him his tea 
in the kitchen. 

After tea a young man came to see Gladys Ethel, and sat beside 
her in a dark room off the bar. He was evidently a very devoted 
young man, for loud smacks, as of kissing, were heard frequently, 
especially when footsteps approached the door of the room. Every- 
body knows that a kiss broken off suddenly in the middle gives forth 
a sound like the first efforts of a pump-sucker to draw water when 
the well is low. Kelly apparently disliked the youth, for he left the 
bar several times, and &quot; hunted &quot; him with much bad language and 
some cuffs on the ear. But the lover was not the sort to be dis- 
couraged by any little thing like that, for he invariably came back, 
and he and Gladys Ethel resumed their affectionate communings 
with renewed ardour. When parent Kelly had &quot; hunted &quot; the 
young man for the fifth time, I judged a little fresh air would do 
me good. I came back from my walk an hour later, to find Gladys 
Ethel&apos;s parent kicking the lover out for the last time, while Gladys 
stood at the door and laughed loudly. 

I went to my room and found, in addition to my luggage, a 
large, greasy swag and a black tin billy. This seemed to indicate a 
room-mate, and was a distinct violation of my agreement, which was 
for a room to myself. I called Kelly, but he made light of it : 
&quot; &apos;Tis only an ould frind of moine that kem in afther tay ; he &apos;s a 
very * quite &apos; man, and shure he may as well be usin&apos; the spare bed as 
it layin&apos; oidle.&quot; So, making the best of it, I turned in and was soon 
asleep, dreaming that wild mermaids, with snaky hair, were chasing 
me all through Kelly&apos;s premises for a kiss. 

I was awakened by Kelly&apos;s voice : 

&quot; For Gawd&apos;s sake, Rine ! do be quite ; ye &apos;11 be wakin&apos; the 
jintleman there.&quot; 



88 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; T&apos;hell wid the jintlemaa ! Shure, I &apos;m as good a man as him, an* 
betther too, for all I bruk me leg ; wake him up an&apos; I &apos;11 fight him.&quot; 
&quot; No, no ! Go to bid, Rine, that &apos;s a dear man.&quot; 
&quot; Wait till I show ye how I bruk me leg,&quot; said Ryan, whom I 
judged was the &quot; quiet &quot; man Kelly had told me of. He took ofiF 
his trousers and showed his skinny leg — bent, stiff, and knobby at 
the knee like that of a &apos;bus-horse. He danced around, clad only 
in his shirt, begging Kelly to let him get at me. He would show 
me his leg, and then fight me for drinks all round. I thought it 
best to sham sleep. Eventually he fell into slumber, and I followed 
suit. Kelly came in half-an-hour later and woke me up to say that 
Ryan was now quiet, and that I might go to sleep without fear of 
further disturbance. I daresay I should have found that out myself, 
but Kelly evidently meant well. About five in the morning, loud 
shouts and sounds as of someone being strangled awoke me, but, to 
my relief, it was only Ryan snoring and probably fighting me in his 



Finding it impossible to doze off again, I got up, dressed, and 
went to the parlour to read. An hour later Gladys Ethel, mooning 
sleepily down the passage, saw me and came in smiling, showing a 
wealth of mouth that in the morning light looked appalling. She 
had not washed her face, and her hair was even wilder and more 
matted than before. Also there were some bits of straw and 
feathers among the locks — which, no doubt, the wind would blow 
out later in the day. 

The next time I went that way I camped out, but a passing 
swagman told me Gladys Ethel was married. It seems that Kelly, 
being very busy in the bar one night, neglected to kick the lover 
out as often as usual, and when he did go into the room the pair 
had eloped together. I also heard on bad authority that Gladys 
unaccountably reformed after marriage, and kept herself reasonably 
clean, and wore stockings, and fixed her mane in a knob at the back 
of her head. But this statement rests on no satisfactory evidence.

MEN AND WOMEN. 



CONSOLATION. 

There was moonlight on the water. The wind blew cold from the 
south-east and sent a gleaming ripple across the bay. Far out the 
dark outline of an island stood in silhouette against the sky ; and 
from the bush came the plaintive cry of the curlew. A narrow jetty 
ran away out to the deep water. Upon it a man sat fishing ; his 
line loose in his hand and a deep frown upon his forehead. 

Fate had been cruel that day. The man had told himself in 
the morning that he would confess his love to the most adorable 
woman on earth, and ask her to be his wife. 

But circumstances conspired, and he had found no opportunity 
to speak with her alone. And now, as he sat looking down at the 
shadows on the water, he heard voices — a man and woman were 
singing, away up at the hotel on the cliflf. The voice of the man 
was that of his dearest friend, and the woman&apos;s voice was the voice 
of her he loved. 

Hushed by the distance, he heard the deep tones of the man as 

he sang : 

Dear one, dost thou love me true ? 
Tell me true, tell me true ! 

And her voice, how sweet it was ! — 

Must I then my secret tell ? — 
Yes, I love thee weU. 

Then their voices blended : 

We are pledged to love for ever. 

Let the world say what it may ; 
Nought but death our hearts can sever, 

Love with life shall pass away. 

And the man on the jetty sighed. 

The music ceased ; there was a sound of a door opened and 
closed; and the figures of the singers came down the hillside

together. The fisherman in the shadow heard their voices as 
they came toward him. They spoke of music, of poetry, of love ; 
and he knew as he listened that he had only dreamed of happiness. 

After a while the woman said, &quot; How cold it is ! &quot; and gave a 
little shiver. And the man by her side took off his coat and threw 
it over her shoulders. She protested, but he fastened it about her 
throat. 

As his fingers — a man&apos;s fingers — fumbled at the button he said : 
&quot; Let me keep you from the cold — dear — for always.&quot; And she 
looked up at him, and he clasped her in his arms and kissed her lips. 

The man sitting looking into the water felt that there was 
nothing left for him to live for. Now he had not even a friend. 
But he kept the line in his hand. 

Back up the hill went the lovers with arms entwined. And he 
was alone with his grief. 

Presently his line tightened with a jerk. He rose quickly to 
his feet, and hand over hand he drew it in. The strain was great, 
and the frown disappeared from his brow. Steadily now he hauled in 
— cautiously — easy — ah ! Before him lay the great, shining, scaly fish. 

He smiled. His face was lit up with the smile. 

He baited another hook, threw in his line, and sitting down 
again looked fixedly into the water. 

There are many good fish in the sea.

HER COUP-DE-THEATRL 

They had been engaged for a year and a half, but lately she had 
noticed that his love was beginning to cool. He never talked in 
the old, rapturous way of &quot; some day,&quot; and their daily meetings had 
dwindled down to weekly, without even letters between. 

The last time she saw him she had noticed that her laughter and 
smart speeches jarred on him, and he had spoken in praise of a 



MEN AND WOMEN. 91 

woman of their acquaintance with a soft, cooing voice. &quot; Purring,&quot; 
the girl called it. 

She expected him to-night, and had made up her mind for 
battle, and victory. She clad herself in her woman&apos;s armour — a 
dress he liked the best, a clinging white cashmere that left her 
throat and shoulders bare. Her soft round arms and neck were her 
strongest weapons, and she meant to use them. 

She was sitting in a low chair when he came, and he noticed 
how the yellow cushion behind her head suited her eyes, her soft 
brown eyes. 

She rose as he came toward her and held out her hands with 
a glad gesture. &quot; I knew you would come to-night, for I have been 
thinking of you all day.&quot; 

He sat down by the fire, but she did not go back to her chair. 
She stood behind him, her fingers playing in his hair in a tender, 
motherly way. She did not speak for some minutes, but he could 
feel her heart against his ear as she leant over him. It made it 
very hard for him to say what he had come to tell her. He wished 
he had written, or waited till to-morrow. Why had she worn that 
frock to-night ? He had not seen it for months. And why was she 
so soft and sweet to-night, when she had been so different lately ? 

&quot; Dear ! &quot; — her voice was a caress, — &quot; why did you stay away so 
long ? I have been so lonely.&quot; Her bare arm came soft and warm 
round his neck, and her cheek was laid on his hair. 

He could never tell her like this. He must do it at once. 
He got up quickly and walked across the room and back again. 
She stood watching him with a hurt, wondering look. 

&quot; What is the matter, Jim ? Something is troubling you. Have 
you anything to tell me ? &quot; 

&quot; Yes, I have. Won&apos;t you sit down t I can&apos;t talk while you 
are standing there.&quot; 

She sat down in her chair by the fire, but he stood against the 
mantelshelf. It gave him courage to stand thus looking down on 
her ; and clumsily, in his man&apos;s way, he told her what he had come 
to say. 



92 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

It was just what she had expected. They had both made a 
mistake. . . . They were not suited to each other. ... He had met 
another girl, a little, fair-haired thin^ who was just the sort of 
gentle woman he wanted for a wife. 

&quot; You are too clever for me, Joy, you know. You would soon 
grow tired of a big, stupid fellow like me. You want a man who 
can talk poetry and metaphysics and stuff like that. And I want a 
wife who cares for home things more than books. You must see 
that we have both been mistaken, don&apos;t you, Joy ? &apos;* 

She sat listening, with her hands clasped before her, her eyes 
never leaving his face for one second. When he finished speaking, 
she made just one little choking sound, and hid her face against the 
chair. 

She did not speak at all, and he stood looking down at her, 
wishing she would not sit like that, wishing she would say something. 
He had expected angry, cutting things ; but instead there was silence, 
and that bent head. What a pretty head it was ! The firelight 
shone on the bright brown hair, and played in the deep ripples 
above her ear. Those ripples were never made by tongs or curling- 
pins, and neither was that little curl that lay on her neck, and tried 
to hide the tiny mole. He remembered that mole so well. She 
had always grumbled at it, but he had kissed it and called it 
her beauty-spot. How long ago that was ! It was soon after 
they were engaged ; the night he had given her that emerald 
ring. He glanced at her hand hanging limp by her side. Yes, 
there it was in the same place on her little finger — she would not 
have it on the third. Her hand would look strange without it, for 
it was the only one she wore. It was a dear hand. Too thin for 
actual beauty, but soft and well-shaped ; and, after all, he did not 
like fat hands. Hers were firm and cool, and so comforting when 
one&apos;s head ached. Ethel&apos;s hands were such baby things, soft and 
pink and kissable, but he liked a woman to have firm, strong hands 
best Joy&apos;s were strong He remembered how she had held his 
dog the day the poor little brute broke its leg. She had cried so 
hard afterwards, too. He wondered if she were crying now. Her

head was still hidden. Would she never look round ? He could n&apos;t 
stand it much longer. He wanted to comfort her. That little mole 
seemed to invite him to kiss it. He 

She lifted her head and looked at him. Her eyes were wet, 
but they gleamed with a depth of love he had never seen there 
before. All the sparkle had gone out of them, but something 
sweeter had come in. She rose and came to where he was standing. 

&quot; Perhaps you are right, dear ! I am too hard and worldly for 
you.&quot; Hard! — with that look in her eyes ! &quot;She will make the 
soft, yielding wife you want, and I know you will be happy. We 
will say good-bye, and you must go away for a while, and then I 
shall get used to it — some day.&quot; 

She was fidgetting with some violets in a bowl beside her, and 
he could see she had something more to say. 

Suddenly she lifted her face to him and held out her hands. 

*&apos; Jim, Jim ! kiss me just once before you go! You will be 
hers soon, but now you are mine still. I love you ; oh, my dear, I 
love you ! &quot; 

Her head was thrown back. Her red lips were parted in 
eagerness, and her eyes glowed with passion. She had never looked 
so beautiful before. For one second he looked at her, and then . . . 
one white arm was round his neck, her head was bowed on his 
shoulder, and she had conquered. 

When he said good-bye, two hours later, it was settled that the 
wedding should be in a month. 

&quot;I nearly made a big mistake,&quot; he said; &quot;which only proves 
that I was right when I said you were too sweet and clever for such 
an ass.&quot; 

Her only answer then was a kiss, but when the door closed 
behind him she smiled at herself in the glass. 

&quot; Yes, he was right ! I am too clever for him. It was a fine 
piece of acting, ma chere ! &quot; — with a little bow to her image in the 
glass — &quot;and it brought down the house ! &quot;

m EGOTIST. 

His first impression on reading the letter was one of unreality. It 
had been lying opposite his seat at table, and, with a premonitory 
chill, he had torn open the envelope and tilted back his chair to 
read. As in a dream he went over it again, but a third reading 
accentuated the phrases and brought acutely to his mind all that the 
loss of her meant. He looked up to find the others engrossed with 
their meal, and wondered angrily that there should be such in- 
difference to his pain. Then, catching glances in his direction, he 
crammed the letter in a pocket and made a pretence at eating, lest 
anyone should guess at his discomfiture. 

Dinner over, he hastened to his room and read her letter again 
and again, noting, through a maze of wonderment, here a trick of 
words, there the lapse into an accustomed endearment. Sitting idly 
on the bed, he absorbed slowly the multiplicity of her conflicting 
reasons, as also her confident assumption of his agreement in them ; 
then wondered vaguely if he were hurt — if this dull numbness 
meant bitter anguish, or merely emotional disappointment. 

She was returning his letters and ring. He affected a 
contemptuous laugh — tribute to an imaginary audience. His ring ! 
To be treasured as the tombstone of his love ? This, obtruding on 
his reflections as rather neat, he made a note of to use in his reply. 

He was taking it very well, he thought. Decidedly, there were 
few men who, loving her as he did — had done — would have accepted 
the dismissal so philosophically. And, after all, there were com- 
pensations. Freedom offered a wider scope for enjoyment than a 
life of domesticity. Some theatre-tickets and a tailor&apos;s bill stuck in 
his mirror suggested the fact that he had never denied himself a 
pleasure. He met this with the reflection that future indulgences 
would be without conscience-qualms. He was tired, too, of 
writing — of the weekly repetition of verbal caresses. She had 
complained of the coldness of his letters. But it was impossible to 
be always at fever-heat. There had been, too, demands on his time 
and purse, which he had found it difficult to explain or even specify. 



MEN AND WOMEN. 95 

Women never understood these things. She wrote of the delay, the 
frequent postponements, and the long years of weary waiting. Well, 
riches were not to be won in a day, and he was no selfish egotist to 
ask a woman to share poverty merely because she loved him. That 
her younger sister and two girl friends had married in the interval 
had no bearing on their case. It was so like a woman&apos;s logic to 
quote these facts as it were in reproach to him. She had known at 
the time of their engagement what his prospects were. He had 
been perfectly honest in defining his position. And if she had not 

been prepared to wait, why had she ? The longer he considered, 

the clearer it became that she had treated him very badly. Still, 
she was a woman. He would be generous with her. 

The question of his reply came to him. This needed 
consideration, for it was imperative that she should recognise 
her position — and her loss. It would be futile to pretend he had 
never loved her, just as it would be absurd to refute her arguments. 
Women, he reflected, never reasoned. 

Remembering she had always dreaded his sarcasm, he decided 
that an admixture of bitterness and cynicism would prove 
effective. The desire to look well, to present the best possible 
appearance, was fast possessing hinL 

He was soon absorbed in the composition of his reply, almost to 
the exclusion of his earlier feelings. After many alterations, he 
completed a fair copy, and read it over with satisfaction. A 
particular phrase fitted in so well with his admiration of himself as 
to raise him almost to exultation. 

&quot;Now, I call that good,&quot; he said, surveying himself in his 
mirror as though for confirmative applause. &quot; Damned good ! &quot; A 
momentary regret that he would not be present to witness its effect 
on her somewhat chilled his enthusiasm. Pride in his handiwork 
increased till a craving for sympathetic appreciation dominated all 
his previous emotions. 

&quot;I wonder if old Strong is in,&quot; he said, handling his letter 
with an almost caressing care. &quot; I &apos;11 go and read this to him. 
He &apos;11 enjoy it.&quot; E. k O. E.

TWO VERDICTS. 

He sat beside her on the sofa, holding her two hands in his. 

Neither spoke, for they imagined they understood one another 
perfectly, and the silence was only broken by the droning hum 
of London&apos;s traffic, and the rustling of the lace curtains in the 
soft June breeze that played with the girl&apos;s brown hair. She was 
the first to break the silence : 

&quot; Kenneth, dear ! &quot; — the pencilled eyebrows arched inquiringly 
— &quot; Kenneth, dear, how much do you love me ? So much that 
nothing, nothing, nothing could ever make any difference 1 &quot; 

&quot; Nothing could : you know that well, little woman,&quot; he 
answered. &quot; What &apos;s up with you now ? &quot; 

&quot; I &apos;m so glad,&quot; she said. &quot; I wanted to tell you something. I 
always meant to tell you, but somehow I could n&apos;t till to-night. 
Ken, there was a man once &quot; 

&quot;Was there, really? I expect there were several men once, if 
you were like you are now.&quot; 

&quot; No there were n&apos;t. There was only one ; he made love to me, 
and I thought I cared for him ; and I tried to show him how much 
I cared. There was only one sort of love he seemed to understand, 
and I — I — oh. Ken, it was five years ago, and — you aren&apos;t angry, 
Ken, darling, are you ? &quot; 

The man&apos;s face was chalk-white. 

In the silence that followed the girl thought she could hear her 
heart beat. Then the man slowly and deliberately took the 
diamond-and-turquoise ring from her finger — and left her. 

He turned at the door, and looked at her. &quot; You &apos;ve spoilt my 
life,&quot; he said. « Good-bye ! &quot; 

He paused on the Thames embankment, looking at the muddy 
river. 

&quot;Two tenners isn&apos;t much,&quot; he said ; and then two diamonds 
glinted for a second in the moonlight as they touched the water. 

The turquoise did not catch the light ; but then turquoise 
signifies &quot; love &quot; — and love was dead. From somewhere in the 



MEN AND WOMEN. 97 

Strand, he could hear a string-band playing Tosti&apos;s &quot;Venetian 
Song,&quot; once a favorite song of his. Now the words seemed 
meaningless to him as he hummed them — 

We are alone ! 
The world, my own, 
Doth hold but you and me I 

&quot;What damned rot ! &quot; he said. 

Tliey sat together in a long cane chair on the station verandah. 

The stillness of the moonlight night was only broken by the 
wail of the curlews and an occasional &quot;moo &apos;* of motherly solicitude 
from the milkers outside the calf-pen fence. The girl spoke first. 

&quot; How much do you love me, Ken ? &quot; she asked. 

&quot; So much, darling,&quot; the man answered, &quot; that I won&apos;t marry 
you under false pretences. You think I &apos;m a sort of a King Arthur, 
but I &apos;ve been more of a Don Juan ; I &apos;ve been several different 
sorts of a blackguard, dear. You can&apos;t understand ; you &apos;re too 
good and pure ; but five years ago I came a bad cropper through a 
woman, and I &apos;ve been a beast since. I wish I could make you 
understand, but &quot; 

&quot;I do understand, old boy,&quot; she answered; &quot;but tell me, 
Ken — never since you knew me ? &quot; 

&quot; Never, darling, I swear that. Do you hate me for what I *ve 
told you ? &quot; 

&quot; Hate you ? No, why should I ; you &apos;re mine now, and what 
does it matter to me what you used to be? &quot; 

In the drawing-room the squatter&apos;s other daughter, fresh from 

a Sydney school, began to sing Tosti&apos;s &quot;Venetian Song &quot; (with the 

soft pedal down). 

We are alone ! 
The world, my own, 
Doth hold but you and me. 
Bat you and me ! 

The man drew the girl close to him and kissed her. 
&quot; I just love that song ! &quot; he said.

A WOMAN AND A FLY. 



She was a sort of experimentalist in emotions, and she was lonely. 
Teaching in the backblocks sharpens the flirtation-palate of a pretty 
girl, and does not decrease her possibilities. 

As regarded this particular victim, she had not meant to go 
further than an experiment. He saw things differently. 

He was only a &quot; cocky,&quot; with little brain beyond sheep ; 
and she was rather a clever girl, with no desire for settling in life 
at twenty. What tempted her into mischief was his size — he was 
one of those tall, strong, hot-tempered male animals who always 
seem to appeal to small women. 

They were returning from a ride one afternoon at sunset, when 
the plains were tenderly tipped with violet and gold. He was 
thinking of her ; she was thinking of the other man — in Sydney. 

&quot;I am not going to fall in love with you.&quot; The suddenness of 
the remark aroused her ; its piquancy startled her. 

&quot;No?&quot; she queried tentatively. He was silent. 

The girl laughed softly as she hummed, &quot; Nobody asked you, 
sir, she said &quot;; at the same time steadying her horse to a walk. 
The experiment was promising, she reflected, and she wanted the 
full measure of its sensations. When you have a fly on a pin you 
should watch it wriggle, and enjoy yourself. 

He looked at her suspiciously, with an uncomfortable idea that 
she was laughing at him. Very likely she was : she never took 
these impressionable men seriously. 

&quot; Pretend you did n&apos;t try 1 &quot; he suggested. She shook her little 
head with sudden gravity. &quot; You do not understand me — dear ! &quot; 
She said the last word softly, daringly. 

When they reached home, and he was lifting her from the 
saddle, he suddenly kissed her. What came over her that she 
did not protest 1 She could not understand : she was generally 
particular in these matters. Besides, she was curiously cold-blooded, 
and so never attempted to lose her self-respect. The man was 
trembling — things were getting beyond a joke for him. 



MEN AND WOMEN. 99 

A few days after, he called again. She was very subdued, and 
more puzzling than ever. She was lying in a camp-chair on the 
verandah, dreamily watching the shadows chasing each other in and 
out of the straggling belt of timber in the distance. 

&quot; Is there any hope for me ? &quot; 

She looked up at him quickly, half-frightened at the expression 
on his face. 

&quot; For what t &quot; she said, shrinkingly. 

*&apos; Well, you let me kiss you ; you know what that means ! &quot; His 
voice sounded like a threat. 

She looked up at him thoughtfully ; the tall, well-knit figure 
pleased her — one part of her ; but the narrow forehead and general 
unpolished look about him offended the other part of her. &quot; I don&apos;t 
see how I could prevent you,&quot; she ventured audaciously. 

He literally gasped : &quot; Why, you never tried ! &quot; 

&quot; I was too hurt,&quot; said the girl, with a pretty air of dignity. 

His face grew absolutely miserable ; and she became afraid 
that compassion (a frequent and unsuspected foe to some women) 
would master her wisdom. She took a mental leap into the possible 
future. She saw herself his wife and him the father of her children. 

That thought saved her. It had been an interesting experi- 
ment, and the fly had wriggled beautifully ; but &apos;t was time to kill it. 

&quot; Good-bye,&quot; she said. 

Nellie Bruton. 



AFTER MANY YEARS. 

She met him in her teens, when life&apos;s glamour was upon them. She 
was simple and unsophisticated ; he, high-spirited and manly. In 
her twenties, they drifted apart in pride and misunderstanding. 
The &quot; eternal love &quot; of a boy and a girl became a thing of far-back 
memories. 

In her thirties, she one day entered a railway-carriage — a 
smiling, gracious woman of the world. In the carriage was a single

occupant. She bowed and smiled as she recognised her fellow- 
traveller, then sank into a window-corner and tried to think of 
nothing in particular as she watched the disappearing trees and 
cottages. It would take two hours to reach the next station. 

How long it was since they had met, and how dear he had 
been ! Even now she could feel his lips upon her hair, and his 
strong hands imprisoning hers. She glanced towards him. What 
a look of pain was on his face ! He, too, must be thinking. Again 
she looked. Without a word he held out his arms. Ah ! how 
sweet the time when she could creep into them as into a sheltered 
fold. 

Suddenly the weight of years rolled from her. She was a girl 
again, and he her king. Throwing aside her heavy cloak she swept 
towards him with a sob that was almost a gasp, and the next 
moment was folded close in his embrace, her face buried on his 
shoulder. 

*&apos; O, Frank ! &quot; she cried. &quot; Frank, forgive me ! I did kiss 
Charlie on the balcony that evening ; but I never thought such a 
slight sin would bring so great a punishment.&quot; 

&quot; My love ! &quot; he answered, &quot; at last we understand each other ! &quot; 

&quot; At last ! &quot; she echoed, as she held up her red lips for a kiss, 
and almost unconsciously pushed the brown curls from off his fore- 
head as in past days. 

&quot;Oh, why was fate so cruel ? Why were we parted so long ? &quot; 

&quot; Nothing shall part us again, Nellie.&quot; 

&quot; No, nothing in Heaven or on earth. I am yours now, and for 
ever and ever.&quot; 

Once again were passionate kisses given and returned, once 
again was the golden head cushioned on the heart that made so 
sweet a resting-place. 

&quot; How far are you going, Frank ? &quot; 

&quot; To the end of the world, pet ; to the very end of our lives 
together.&quot; 

She lifted her head, and half drew herself from his arms. 

&quot; What do you mean ? &quot; 




MEN AND WOMEN. 1;G1. 



&quot; I mean what you said just now, that nothing in Heaven or on 
earth shall take you from me, or me from you again.&quot; 

&quot; I was mad ! &quot; she answered. &quot; But let me be yours for five 
minutes longer ; then — love must die and life end. Kiss me again — 
again ! &quot; 

The train whistled. She tore herself from his arms, threw on 
her cloak, and took her sunshade from the rack. 

He stood before her, wonder-stricken. 

&quot; Good-bye,&quot; she said, bowing and smiling ; and the same 
gracious woman who had entered the carriage at the last station 
left it at this ; and, without a trace of emotion on her fair face, 
joined her husband and children on the platform.

HE HAD NOT HURT HER. 

She was young when Love came — very young. Life was still 
hedged round with dreams. At her age life might be stormy, sad, 
or lonely, but never flat and tasteless. Then the world burst into 
blossom suddenly and unreasonably — as it does when one is very 
young. And, of course, Love was everything. 

For a month they met and gloried in the sunrise delicacy of 
unspoken passion. The month passed away. He did not speak ; 
she dared not ; and the world turned into mourning. Yet she 
cherished her dream for seven years. 

They met again. What a passionate pulse played in her 
blood ! Old ghosts came out and stared at her everywhere. She 
looked to the meeting with unspeakable dread and longing. They 
m6t ; and with a great ache she recognised that her lover had died 
with her youth. The man who stood in his place was an alien and 
A stranger. The faint mannerisms he possessed in old days had 
become decided habits. Where a dimple had been on the boy&apos;s face 
a wrinkle lay in the man&apos;s. She had grown more fastidious and

discerning. He had grown less so. She had ripened and enriched ; 
he had ceased growing with her last knowledge of him, and was 
perfectly satisfied with himself. She looked into his changed, 
shallow eyes with a breaking heart, and said to herself, &quot; What 
matter ? Love is all. For life or death I am his. He has needed 
me. That is all. I will take his life again, and Paradise will come 
back to the earth.&quot; 

&quot; Surely you will never marry him ? &quot; said her friends, guessing 
her thoughts. &quot; &apos;T would throw away your life ! &quot; 

&quot; Love is all ! &quot; she said. 

One sweet, dark evening he walked home with her. His 
manner had the old tenderness, but none of the old doubt. He 
drew her hand through his arm. She permitted it. Then, for the 
first time since their meeting, he spoke of the past. 

&quot; I believe you loved me then,&quot; he said. 

&quot; And you 1 &quot; she queried. 

&quot;You know ! &quot; he answered, softly. For a thrilling second the 
past lived again. &quot; And you ? &quot; he insisted. 

Then she flung off her long, maiden silence, and spoke: &quot;I 
loved you — God knows I did ! &quot; There was something of the wail 
from the dead in it. Nevertheless, it was the supreme moment of 
her life. She soared into heights unguessed — far, far from the man 
at her side. 

For the first time his complacency was disturbed. &quot; I was not 
worthy,&quot; he whispered. 

She answered with sweet scorn : &quot; A man must be honourable.&quot; 

&quot; But you heard something about me ? &quot; he insisted. 

&quot;Nothing.&quot; 

&quot; I thought you might have heard some gossip.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; 

&quot; Well, I would have been married, but there were difficulties 
in the way. She thinks a great deal of me.&quot; 

In a waking dream she heard such sentences as : &quot; When a 
fellow looks for a home&quot; . . . &quot;She is awfully fond of me.&quot; Her 
senses came back as she heard him say : &quot; But I would n&apos;t like to

think I had done you any kind of wrong. You see, women are not 
like men. They hold on to things ; but a man forgets. You don&apos;t 
think I have hurt you at all, do you ? &quot; 

She looked at the familiar scene. The scent of lilac suffocated 
her. The past stabbed her. She knew what a paltry lie love was 



&quot;No,&quot; she said.

plantation, Sarawaga river, island of Vanua Levu, Fiji, im- 
patiently waiting dinner. It was longer than usual in coming, 
and more than once I had shouted to Lonea, the cook, to hurry up, 
receiving always the stereotyped answer, &quot;/o, saka, mcUua 
vakalailaief &quot; (&quot; Yes, sir, wait a little.&quot;) 

Suddenly, after a longer pause than usual, Lonea bounced on 
to the verandah in a state of wild excitement. His eyes flamed and 
his breath came fast as he asked : 

&quot; Did you eat any of your curry, sir ? &quot; 

&quot; Eat any of the curry ! How could I when you have n&apos;t 
given me a chance ? But, see here, my friend, if it is n&apos;t on the 
table smartly, by the Lord I &apos;11 eat you I &quot; 

Utterly disregarding the terrible threat, Lonea only rapped 

out, with rising anger, &quot; Then it &apos;s some of those niggers ! &apos;^ 

(using the last epithet of contempt one &quot;nig.&quot; can hurl at another). 

&quot; What &apos;s that ? What have they been up to ? &quot; 

&quot; Eaten your curry ! Come and see.&quot; 

Now this was a serious matter, and with an energetic &quot; The 
devil they have ! &quot; I followed Lonea to the vale ni kv/ro. There, 
sure enough, stood the dish of curry that would in its perfect state 
have adorned my table and progressed gently through my digestive 
apparatus — but what a wreck ! 

Half the contents of dismembered fowl had disappeared, and 
in the rampart of rice by which it had been surrounded there were 
unmistakeable marks of the thievish fingers which had made 
free with the greater portion. My dinner was spoiled. 

&quot; Who did this ? &quot; I asked, wrathfully. 

104 



BOWLED OUT. 105 

*&apos; I don&apos;t know, sir ; but one of those Ra men, I think.&quot; 

&quot; Were they about here ? &quot; 

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 

&quot;Who?&quot; 

&quot; Masid, Taniela, Warri, Tioni, Radovo and Taviuni.&quot; 

&quot;Any in the kitchenf &quot; 

&quot; Not while I was here, sir.&quot; 

&quot; Well, you go to their hure and tell them all to muster on the 
verandah at once, if they don&apos;t want me after them ; and send me 
your chief, Rogo.&quot; 

Tanna men are true as steel in a fight. They will stand to you 
like white men. Rogo came and quickly took my instructions, and 
I then went to make my own preparations for dealing with the 
culprit among the Ra men ; for this offence, combining theft, 
sacrilege and insult, had to be promptly avenged. 

The Ra men were not long in answering the summons, and, 
having strapped on my revolver, I lined them up against the rail. 

All were there ; twenty bronze figures perfectly nude but for 
the sulu around the loins. 

Then Rogo and his ten Tanna men, fully armed, quietly 
appeared and took up a position at a little distance ; so that when 
I began my harangue on the enormity of the offence committed, and 
expressed my determination to discover and punish the culprit, the 
Ra men felt that I was in earnest. 

I told them white men liad means of detection about which 
ignorant Ra Viti knew nothing, and that I w£is bound to find out 
the thief. Of course, all loudly protested innocence and denounced 
the offender. 

Then the stance commenced. 

I first went down the line looking for curry sign, making each 
one open his mouth. The draw was not altogether a blank, but it 
afforded no positive proof. 

&quot;Now,&quot; I said, &quot;I am going to show you how a white man 
finds out a thief, and woe to him who tells me lies.&quot; 

Then, commencing with the first man, I clapped my hand on 



106 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

his bare chest, over his heart, and sharply asked, &quot; Did you eat my 
curry? &quot; 

&quot; Segai, saka, au hvhului ki na Kalou dina au sega ni hunia.&quot; 
(&quot;No, sir; I swear by the true God I didn&apos;t.&quot;) 

&quot; Did you ? Did you ? Did you ? &quot; — and the answer was repeated 
all down the line, while the heart-beat under my hand was but 
normal. 

Then I came to Taviuni (so called because he had long lived on 
the island of that name). ** Did you ? &quot; 

&quot; No, I swear ! &quot; But the thump, thump, thump of his heart 

under my hand told a different story, changing suspicion into 
certainty ; and he turned the yellowy-white colour of dirty fat as I 
thundered out — &quot; You lie ! Here, Lonea, bring me that bilo.&quot; 

Lonea brought the cup in which I had prepared a gentle dose of 
ipecacuanha out of the medicine-chest. 

&quot; Now, drink this ! &quot; 

At first, Taviuni refused, believing he was to be poisoned out- 
right ; but, by tasting it myself and showing him the revolver, I at 
last induced him to reconsider his decision. 

He drank, and we all waited results. Presently he turned 
to go. 

&quot; Stop there ! &quot; 

&quot;ilw tauveimate^ saka &quot; (&quot;I &apos;m unwell, sir.&quot;) 

&quot; All right— stop there.&quot; 

&quot; Au via lua, saka 1 &quot; 

&quot; All right. Lua where you are ! &quot; And — ye gods ! — he did. 

There were one or two premonitory throes ; then a mighty 
convulsion of the whole man ; and — well, everybody soon knew who 
stole the curry. 

The man&apos;s discomfiture was his sufficient punishment ; but the 
story flew far and wide, and I became speedily famous as a mighty 
medicine-man on the strength of the way in which I bowled out 
Master Taviuni.

NELL&apos;S LETTER. 

SHE had been standing at the open door since her brother&apos;s 
early breakfast. The breakfast-things were still on the table, 
just as Bob had left them ; but her own tea was now cold, 
and her bread and bacon remained untasted. Before her lay the 
dreary panorama of ridge and gully, clothed with poverty-stricken 
gum-trees, which is common to the northern slopes of the Blue 
Mountains. The persistent monotony of the sky-line was broken 
only by the barren effort of Mount Hay towards individuality ; and 
at this distant land-mark Nell was frowning through the sunlight, 
her eyes set in an unseeing stare. 

She was thinking about a letter. It was not one she had 
received, for she had never received a letter in her life ; but one she 
felt she must write. Was it not nearly six months since Jim had 
gone away 1 — yet no word had come to her of his doings or intentions. 
It was nearly summer again, and she had told herself all along that 
with the summer Jim would certainly return. Not that she blamed 
Jim ; for it was absurd to suppose that Jim could know of her 
trouble, seeing that when he went away she did not know of it herself. 
She passed her hand wearily over her brow, for she had been 
thinking deeply, and she was not used to thinking. She felt that 
the letter would be difficult to write. Of course it was for Jim — 
her hero, Jim — who never laughed at her blunders ; yet even with 
Jim it would be hard to choose her words. For Nell, though 
simple, was not stupid. * 3he was instinctively modest ; and then 
she knew she must not hurt Jim&apos;s feelings, or say anything that 
might be taken as an appeal to his generosity. Because Jim was a 
gentleman, a real gentleman, whose words or actions must never be 
called in question. 

107 



108 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

So, having thought it all out in her own little way, Nell went 
inside and cleared away the breakfast-things. Then she took the 
bottle of violet ink, and the pink paper with the blue lines, and the 
ornamental pen with the impossible point. She spread them 
laboriously before her on the table, and sat down with her back to 
the light to accomplish an act of common justice to her lover. 
Pausing often for inspiration, she tried hard with her stiff little 
fingers to keep the wayward, spluttering pen within the limits ruled 
for it. Dip succeeded dip in the narrow-necked bottle, blush 
followed blush over her freckled face, sheet after sheet of the pink 
paper was spoilt and thrown aside ; and before the task was 
done the afternoon had come and the writer was nearly 
exhausted. When her name was duly signed she rose and stretched 
her limbs, cramped by the unaccustomed labour. As she moved 
about the room, preparing for what should have been her mid-day 
meal, she was able to look back upon her efforts with something 
approaching complacency ; having, as she hoped, explained the 
situation without affront either to Jim or to herself. 

When she had taken some tea and food, she drew from her 
pocket a crumpled old envelope. It contained a collar-stud and 
other trifles, relics of Jim, and bore the address : 

Mr. James O&apos;Lyon, 

Post Office, 

cookawarra. 

This envelope she had found on the floor after one of Jim&apos;s visits. 
She had preserved it as a keepsake ; but now it was the only link 
between her narrow life and the great outside world into which her 
lover had withdrawn. 

So Nell copied the address upon a tinted envelope, tidied her 
wavy hair, and set out with her letter to the town, carrying an old 
shawl over her arm, though it was not cold and the sun was still 
high. It was with a feeling more nearly akin to happiness than she 
had enjoyed for some time, that Nell followed the winding track 
from the selection to the town and back again. That night she 



NELVS LETTER. 109 

prepared her brother&apos;s tea and endured his ill-humour with 
comparative serenity, comforted by the thought that everything 
would soon be right. 

Six weeks had passed, yet no answer had come from Jim. In 
spite of herself, Nell was losing heart. Since the despatch of her 
letter, she had walked daily to the post-office to enquire for an 
answer; trudging the three miles and a half into the town with 
faint hopes, and the three miles and a half back again with ever- 
deepening despair. At tirst, on tine days, the walk was not un- 
pleasant; but, as weeks went by and the sun grew hotter, the 
exertion began to tell upon her. Her head was always dizzy, and 
sleeplessness was wearing her down. There came a day when she 
fainted on the road, and lay some time unconscious. She crawled 
home with difficulty, and next morning she felt too weak to rise 
from bed. 

So far, she had succeeded in hiding her trouble from her 
brother ; but in her weakness and helplessness she made up her 
mind to face the worst, and tell Bob all about it. So the following 
morning, when Bob was breakfasting in moody silence, she 
commenced her faltering tale. It was some time before her brother 
grasped the situation ; but when at length he did understand, he 
vented his passion in a torrent of abuse. He even struck her ; for 
brutal and vulgar minds, when by accident they find themselves on 
the side of respectability, forego none of the privileges of the 
position. When he thought his taunts had begun to lose their sting 
he left her. On his return at night the house was empty. Nell 



The train sped on through the night. It was just daylight 
when Nell, shaken and feverish, left the carriage at Cookawarra. 
For many hours she had not tasted food ; her head throbbed ; and 
she could scarcely stand. The station-master noticed her. &quot; You 
seem ill, miss,&quot; he said ; &quot; would you like to sit down in the waiting- 
room for a few minutes ? &quot; 



110 TEE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

Nell thanked him, and turned to follow, then tottered and fell. 
When she came to, she was lying on a seat in the waiting-room, and 
the station-master was holding a glass of water to her lips. &quot; Are 
you better now ? &quot; he asked kindly. &quot; Yes, thank you,&quot; she said 
feebly. He left her for a moment, and returned, saying, &quot;Sit still 
awhile, and rest yourself. I &apos;ve brought you the paper to look at.&quot; 
She thanked him wearily and sat up. He went out, closing the 
door behind him, and when he had gone Nell took up the paper, and 
almost immediately her eye met this paragraph : 

Caught at Last.— When going to prees we were credibly informed that, 
owing to the praiseworthy endeavours of Ck&gt;nstable Bolger, the notorious swindler, 
James C^Lyon, has again been brought within reach of the law. He is now in 
the lock-up, and will be brought up at the police-court this morning. A full 
account of the proceedings will appear in our next issue. 

With a terrible jump at her heart, Nell realised what this 
meant to her. She was helpless, homeless, almost penniless, and her 
darling Jim was in prison, charged with — she knew not what — some 
terrible mistake — of course the charge was false ! But how long 
would it take for Jim to clear himself ? And what should she do in 
the meantime ? Instantly she made up her mind to go straight to 
the lock-up, and to see Jim, if only for a minute. Poor old Jim ! 

So she enquired her way from the friendly station-master, and 
slowly walked down the quiet street, gazing absently about her. At 
last she reached the lock-up. It stood by itself on the other side of 
the town — a rough, wooden building, bare and forbidding. A short 
distance away was the constable&apos;s house, enclosed within a neat 
fence along which honeysuckle grew thickly. Nell walked boldly 
in and knocked at the door. No one answered, and she knocked 
again. Still there was no answer, and Nell bethought herself that 
it was little past five o&apos;clock. If she disturbed these people they 
would be offended, and she must avoid giving offence if she wished 
to see Jim. She walked aimlessly out through the gate, and round 
the corner of the honeysuckle hedge, casting many wistful glances 
at the lock-up She would sit down and rest — her head ached so. 
She heard the distant jangling of cow-bells, the cry of magpies, and 
all the sounds of early morning, while from the honeysuckle over- 



NELL&apos;S LETTER HI 

head came a perfume which she inhaled greedily. Then a drowsi- 
ness overtook her, and she slept. 

CJonstable Bolger had been obliged to postpone the official over- 
hauling of the prisoner&apos;s person, and it was about eight o&apos;clock in 
the morning when he came out of the lock-up with a letter in his 
hand. It was, of course, the constable&apos;s duty to read over any 
papers found on a prisoner, so, bracing himself to carry out the 
work he had so well begun, he seated himself upon a comfortable 
garden chair beneath the honeysuckle hedge. Having carefully 
lighted his pipe and spread out his feet to the sun, he devoted his 
attention to the letter, which was queerly written on pink paper 
with blue lines, in wayward violet characters. 

It is certainly a very funny composition, for Constable Bolger 
rolls about on his seat as though a fit were imminent. Now he has 
read it through, and looks round for someone with whom to share 
his enjoyment. Surely that is Banks — there, by the lamp-post ! 
&quot; Holloa there, Banks ! &quot; roars Bolger. &quot; Coo-e-e ! Come here ; I 
want you.&quot; 

Banks seems deaf, and the oonstable roars again. On the 
other side of the hedge a tired girl opens her eyes, and tries to rise. 
But her head is whirling — she seems to have no power over her 
limbs — she will lie down again — in a little while she will feel better. 

&quot; Now, then, just listen to this ! &quot; chuckles the constable when 
his friend is seated comfortably beside him. &quot; Listen to this ! &apos; My 
own, dear, beautiful Jim.&apos; Eh? All right; it&apos;s only the cows. 
Never knew Jim O&apos;Lyon, did you, Banks 1 * My own, dear, beautiful 
Jim.&apos; That &apos;s him in the lock-up now. He &apos;s a dear, beautiful 
daisy is Jim : but wait. * I hope this finds you in as good health as 
it leaves me at present.&apos; Hope it does, so help me three buck 
niggers &apos; &apos; Since you went away it has been cold mostly O, Jim, 
what beautiful days them was before you went away.&apos; My colonial 
troubles ! Them was eight-hour days, them was ! &apos; I &apos;m not so 
happy as I was, because Bob does go on so with drinking and 



112 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

swearing and such like, and there ain&apos;t no one to say what you used 
to say.&apos; No ; strike me ugly if they can any of &apos;em put it so genteel 
as the irresistible Jimmie ! &apos; I lay awake at nights thinking of you 
know who.&apos; O, my oath, Jim knows who right enough ! &apos;O Jim, 
if you was here I could tell you, but writing ain&apos;t the same, some- 
how.&apos; Ha, ha, ha ! Why, what &apos;s the matter, man ? What ? 
Cry out ? Why, it &apos;s only them cows laughin&apos;. It would 
make a snake laugh ! Sit down. It &apos;s nothing ! Listen ! * But 
I&apos;ve told no one that you love me.&apos; James has her on a bit of 
whipcord this time, and no mistake. Just listen here ! * O, Jim, 
sometimes I think what mother would have said, but if she had 
known you she would say it was all right, &apos;cause you are a gentle- 
man and knows best. But, O Jim, do come and see me again in 
summer same as you did before.&apos; Not quite. Probably James will 
have other things to do this summer ! &apos; With heaps of kisses. &apos; 
Rows of &apos;em ; just look ! What ! Going ? Well, so long ! &quot; And 
Constable Bolger went inside. 

On the other side of the fence a worn, pitiful figure lies still, 
very still. The cows are beginning to feel the growing power of the 
sun, and graze closer in the shadow of the honeysuckle. One great 
brindled beast comes and sniflfs at the sleeping figure of the girl, 
then calmly crops a tuft of grass which her head is almost touching. 
She does not heed it ; the hoarse, hollow sound of the bell upon its 
neck does not seem to disturb her slumber. 

She lies so very still. 

W. B. Young. 



JESSOP&apos;S COAT. 

JESSOP wore a new coat — a gorgeous garment bedecked with 
astrakhan, and beautified by moonlike buttons. It must 
have cost six pounds. Lucky, luxurious dog, Jessop ! 

Very different was the condition of Judson and Robins. They 
were two chronically moneyless bank-clerks, with a holiday, a &quot; dead 
bird &quot; for the Anniversary Handicap, and not a copper to back it 
with. Standing at a street corner they discussed the situation and 
every financial possibility, concluding reluctantly that they had 
neither cash nor credit. Suddenly Judson said : 

&quot; Look at this blessed Crcesus coming along ! &quot; 

&quot; Who ? &quot; queried Robins. 

&quot; Why, Jessop ! with a coat on him like an Angora goat.&quot; 

With an air of envy and resentment, Judson and Robins 
watched the fine-feathered Jessop till he entered a lodging-house 
near by. 

&quot; I suppose we could n&apos;t tap him again 1 &quot; Robins murmured 
reflectively. 

&quot; Tap him / No, indeed ! If Jessop does n&apos;t know us no one 
does. But, by Jove ! I &apos;ve got an inspiration. We &apos;11 borrow his 
coat.&quot; 

&quot; You &apos;re a genius, Judson, I know,&quot; remarked Robins ; &quot;but I 
don&apos;t see what good that would be to us on a sweltering day like 
this.&quot; 

&quot; Could n&apos;t we put it up the spout ? Could n&apos;t we get three or 
four quid on it ? Could n&apos;t we back Caravan with the stuff, make a 
* pony &apos; each, and redeem the coat after the race ? Could n&apos;t we, 
eh ? &quot; broke out Judson like a dynamited note of interrogation. 

&quot; We could, we could,&quot; assented Robins, humbly ; &quot; but how &apos;11 

H 113 



114 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

we get the coat ? Jessop would know we had no need of it on a 
day like this.&quot; 

&quot; He wears it to show off. Why should n&apos;t one of us ? But 
I &apos;ve got a cat that will jump better than that.&quot; 

Having thus sanely delivered himself, Judson&apos;s stock of sanity 
seemed exhausted, for he began to act in a way which Robins liked 
as little as he understood. First, he wet his hand in the gutter^ 
then he made for it a sort of mud glove by diving it into the dust. 
That done, he deliberately printed a filthy impression of his paw 
fair in the centre of Robins&apos; shirt-front. Robins was just about to 
move round and curse at large, when the eccentric Judson remarked : 

&quot; Now go and borrow Jessop&apos;s coat to hide your dirty shirt.&quot; 

&quot;Judson,&quot; said Robins, feelingly, &quot;you are indeed a genius. 
Let us go together.&quot; 

They went, and Jessop laughed very much at Robins&apos; shirt-front, 
and said Judson was a wag. He was in a fine humour, and when 
Robins mentioned his wish to have a loan of the coat, Jessop 
said : 

&quot;Certainly, with the greatest of pleasure,&quot; — and in a minute 
Robins was arrayed in half-a-hundredweight of coat. 

&quot; Are you fellows going into town ? &quot; said Jessop. They were 
in South Yarra. 

&quot; Er — yes ! &quot; said Judson, &quot; we &apos;re going to walk.&quot; He thought 
that might deter Jessop, if he had a design to accompany them. 

&quot; Oh, I &apos;11 walk,&quot; said Jessop. 

There was no escape, so Judson and Robins hypocritically 
ejaculated, &quot; That &apos;s fine ! &quot; 

Long before they got to town Robins felt the weight of Jessop&apos;s 
coat, and perspired freely. He, however, consoled himself with the 
prospect that they would soon get rid of Jessop, and, soon after, of 
his coat. 

When they reached the city they all stood, Judson and Robins 
expecting that Jessop would go his way, and so determine theirs. 
They were, therefore, greatly perturbed when Jessop remarked, 
&apos;* Where are you fellows going to day ? &quot; 



JESSOP&apos;S COAT. 115 

&quot; Er — er,&quot; began Judson, desperately, &quot;we were thinking of 
taking a stroll out to Coburg.&quot; 

That classic and compulsory resort of Victoria&apos;s criminality is a 
distance of five miles from Melbourne, and Judson mentioned it 
with a view to Jessop&apos;s possible wish to join them. Great was the 
horror of the conspirators when Jessop said : 

&quot; Well, I &apos;ve got nothing else to do to-day, I &apos;11 go with you.&quot; 

To groan or make any other conventional demonstration would 
have been to betray themselves. They suffered, and Robins sweated, 
in silence. Their only hope was to get it over, dodge Jessop, pawn 
the coat, and rush away to Williamstown in time to back Caravan 
for the Handicap. They resigned themselves to Fate, and started 
upon the walk to which they had been so calamitously committed. 
Jessop was in jubilant spirits, and rallied his friends upon their 
sudden depression. 

That tramp will live in the memory of Jessop, Judson, and 
Robins all their days, and it will be among their choicest 
reminiscences of earth when they meet in &quot; the great Perhaps.&quot; 
For the first couple of miles poor Robins got the worst of it, with 
the result that Judson, simply through seeing another man in a more 
unpleasant plight than himself, gradually recovered his characteristic 
cheerfulness. Robins perspired and grew very bloody-minded under 
his affliction. He knew there was a creek at Coburg, and he 
commenced to plot a scheme whereby Jessop might be drowned in 
it. Several other murderous methods he discussed, mentally, while 
Jessop and Judson made jokes and laughed. His condition was 
truly dreadful, but it was beautifully and almost completely com- 
pensated by Providence. 

A thunderstorm gathered. The relentless, roasting sun became 
veiled by heavy clouds big with their terrible triplets — flash, crash, 
a ad splash. There was a mighty kick-up, and the rain came down 
as if the River Jordan had found a crack in the sky. Robins 
revelled in it. Jessop&apos;s coat was watertight. 

Jessop and Judson were dumb and depressed. Jessop was 



116 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

particularly annoyed. He cast furtive glances at his coat, and once 
or twice seemed about to say something. At last he blurted out : 

&quot; Look here, Robins, I don&apos;t see why I should get wet through 
while you &apos;re keeping yourself dry with my coat. You might be 
gentleman enough to return it now that you see I have need of it.&quot; 

&quot; That be hanged ! &quot; retorted Robins. &quot; You lent me the coat, 
and I want it as much as ever I did, and a great deal more.&quot; 

This delighted Judson, who made remarks calculated to make 
the disputants very angry. They warmed up until Jessop said that 
Robins was &quot; nothing but a low cad.&quot; 

This was altogether too much for Robins, who impulsively took 
off the coat, flung it at Judson (who immediately put it on), and 
violently attacked Jessop. A fierce fight ensued, in which both 
belligerents got wet through, while Judson, cosy in Jessop&apos;s coat, 
looked on, acted referee, and immensely enjoyed himself. Finally, 
Jessop conquered, which perhaps was only just. 

The elemental strife ceased almost simultaneously, and when 
the sun came out again the steamy exhalations from the soaked 
ground made the heat more oppressive than ever. Judson wished to 
return the coat to Robins, Robins could n&apos;t see it. He was covered 
with mud as a consequence of his combat with Jessop, but as they 
were in the country he did not mind that. Nothing would induce 
him to again wear the infernal coat in such an atmosphere. It 
looked as if there would be another fight, when a friend of Judson&apos;s 
came along driving a covered waggonette, and offered them a lift to 
town. This they joyfully accepted, and soon were once more in 
Melbourne. 

The necessity to get rid of Jessop was as strong with Judson 
and Robins as ever, and Jessop unexpectedly came to their relief. 
He said he was going to have a shave, and asked if they would come 
in and wait. They went and watched Jessop get lathered. As 
soon as he was thus secured Judson slipped out. Robins followed. 

At last they were free, and they hurriedly repaired to a pawn- 
shop. Judson took charge of the delicate business, and when safe 



JESSOP&apos;S COAT. 117 

within the curtained recess he exhibited the coat with the usual 
formula. The Hebrew proprietor closely examined the garment, 
and then turned and ran his swivel eye down the stolen-property 
list. Then he called out &quot; Nebuchadnezzar ! &quot; and a juvenile Jew 
came, to whom the ancient one whispered a mission. 

The unsophisticated Judson and Robins regarded all this as 
business, and were patient. 

At last the pawnbroker asked them, &quot; Yadt you vandt on de 
goat ? &quot; 

&quot; Four pounds is a fair thing, I think ! &quot; returned Judson. 

Thereupon followed the inevitable haggling, which was harshly 
interrupted by the entrance of two policemen, who exchanged a few 
words with the Jew and then took the excessively-protesting Judson 
and Robins in charge for &quot; larceny of the Chief Justice&apos;s coat.&quot; 
This was, in two senses, &quot; a bolt from the blue,&quot; and gladly would 
the astonished adventurers have made it so in a third by a bold dash 
for freedom. But that was put out of the question by each 
constable seizing his man by the collar and running him to the 
lock-up. 

Judson and Robins were grievously pained by this indignity. 
They thought of Caravan. They also thought of Jessop, and 
wondered in what mysterious fashion his coat was connected with 
that of the Chief Justice. This suggested to Judson the idea of 
sending for Jessop and getting him to explain. He accordingly 
detailed to the sergeant a statement of how they had borrowed the 
coat from Jessop, who had given them permission to pawn it. The 
sergeant listened with that incredulous air which does much to 
create an impression of official wisdom in the minds of an awed 
public, and, with lightning rapidity based a &quot; theory &quot; upon the 
prisoners&apos; story. He decided that Jessop was an accomplice in the 
heinous crime of stealing the Chief Justice&apos;s coat, and, having 
obtained his address from the too-confiding Judson, promptly 
ordered his arrest. 

In due course Jessop joined his former companions of the day, 
who explained that they had been walking along the street when 



118 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

the policeman arrested thorn. In return, Jessop narrated how he 
had been struck with the Chief Justice&apos;s coat and had obtained one 
exactly like it. This Judson and Robins rather resented, and they 
reproached Jessop with having indulged his vanity in a direction 
which had brought them to such trouble. 

What might have been the fate of the unfortunates is not nice 
to surmise. What did happen is painful to relate. It gave the 
sergeant such a shock that he had to be pensioned shortly after- 
wards. Standing at the watch-house door and looking along the 
street he saw, being hustled along by a constable, but vigorously 
resisting and protesting, that Holy of Holies — the Chief Justice. 
None other. 

The sergeant, however, had his duty to perform, and with every 
expression of pain he enquired the charge. 

&quot; Larceny of the Chief Justice&apos;s coat, which he is at present 
wearing,&quot; quoth the last man to join ; and the sergeant sank down 
upon a seat and begged to be excused. 

There was no need for the learned and outraged dignitary to 
explain. The sergeant divined all. The coat had been recovered 
and restored to its owner, who upon again wearing it had been run 
in by the raw recruit. 

It took a great deal to pacify the big gun of the law, but he 
finally departed in peace. Shortly afterwards, Jessop, Judson and 
Robins were released, Jessop keeping possession of his coat ; and in 
much amazement at the ways of the law they went home. 

That night Judson and Robins read in the evening papers how 
Caravan had been beaten by a bare head. Then they silently shook 
hands, and as one man blessed the frustration of their plot to 
hypothecate &quot; Jessop&apos;s Coat.&quot;

A STEP TOO HIGH. 

TE PAREHAO was a Maori chief, and Te Parehao had some- 
thing on his mind. He made no sign, and worked away 
with spade and spear among the gum-diggers as if his 
thoughts were as tranquil as usual. Toward afternoon, though, 
when chance threw him alone with Herewini, the oldest, and there- 
fore the most respected chief in Taiere, he made known his trouble 
quietly, and asked advice. 

Herewini was grieved beyond measure when he heard ; but he 
alone could not give counsel in a case like this, he must consult the 
other rangatiras of the settlement. 

The meeting took place at dusk in Herewini&apos;s own whari. Five 
chiefs, all of high rank, were present. They sat silently round a 
fire in the middle of the floor, spitting into the coals. Te Parehao, 
the sixth chief, and the one chiefly interested, was late in arriving ; 
but he came at last and squatted quietly by the fire. Then Here- 
wini&apos;s voice called on him to make known the cause of this meeting ; 
and the listeners moved from the tire a little, and regarded Te 
Parehao expectantly. 

He introduced himself warrior fashion, then reminded them 
that he had been husband four months to a woman who was very 
pleasing to the eye ; that she went away only yesterday to see her 
friends, who lived some two miles past the pakeha&apos;s house ; and that 
it was a moonlight night last night. Very well. He felt solitary, 
and went out &apos; He walked, he walked a long way, and at last the 
home of the only white man in Taiere was before his eyes. Then 
was he coming back, but he saw through the trees a man and woman 
going along to the house Ah ! these chiefs of high blood before 
him would feel sick with shame, for the woman was she to whom he 

119 



120 THE BULLETIN UTORY BOOK. 

had been married four moDths : the man was that wicked pakeha ? 
Well, they went in, and he waited and waited ; and the moon had 
gone down, and it was near the rising of the sun when the woman 
came out of the house and went back to the home of her friends, 
two miles away. That was all his korerOy and he would ask the 
wise men present what was to be done. 

An old chief cleared his throat and spat impressively into the 
lire. He had a few observations to make. In the first place, the 
white man&apos;s punishment should be great, because he expected too 
much. Not only did they allow him two girls to keep house and 
wash, but he frequently came and spent hours in the society of other 
women, and wrong was not thought of it. And now — a chief&apos;s 
wife ! — that was a step too high. Those were all his words. 

The next gentleman agreed with all his learned friend had said. 
He suggested a form of punishment which, under similar circum- 
stances, has suggested itself to many nations, and waited. An older 
chief did not think the mode severe enough. What did the others 
think % They left it-&gt;in the hands of the chief whose honour had 
been injured. Would Te Parehao speak ? 

Yes ; he wanted the life of the white man and his mistress that 
night. As for the kind of punishment proposed — no, Te Parehao 
would sooner butcher the white man outright. Plenty of supple- 
jacks he would take to lash the two together ; and he wanted help 
to drag them to the coast. The sea was big — the sea might wash 
out their stain. First he would go to the house of the white man, 
and tie him up ; then away to where the woman was, and ask her 
to come home. The rest would be easy. Who would help him ? 

Two of the strongest offered their services at once. 

It was moonlight, and nine o&apos;clock ; and the premises of Joseph 
Mackerrow, storekeeper, had been closed for two or three hours. 
The owner himself had been out in the moonlight half-an-hour ago, 
but he had gone in, and now there was no light in the place. Na 
light, and no one about. 

Hush ! Was not that a woman who walked quickly up in the 



A STEP TOO HIGH. 121 

pale moonlight toward the door, and opened it, and went in ? And 
what of three figures that lay in the shadow of a clump of blackish- 
trunked manuka trees huddled together near the house ? It was 
hard to see them, no matter how you peered. 

It must have been half-an-hour after the woman went in when 
these figures got up and approached the door noiselessly. It was 
unlocked, and in they went without a sound, each carrying a bundle 
of split supplejacks. 

Then everything was inanimate again. 

Time passed. The place was now in shadow, now lit up, and 
again in shadow, as a few clouds straggled across the moon. When 
at length all was clear, and she looked down, the three chiefs were 
out in front of the house once more ; and on the ground near them 
a man and woman lay in each other&apos;s arms, lashed together in half- 
a-dozen places. They formed a picture that seemed to please 
Te Parehao&apos;s idea of revenge; for he regarded them often, and 
occasionally even spoke to the woman in Maori, to the man in 
broken English. 

His wife of four months shed tears, only to be jeered at ; and 
the gum-merchant was fast going into stupor — partly through fear, 
and partly because the tight binding was beginning to affect his 
circulation. 

They made too heavy a load to drag, so their captors decided 
upon securing the services of a cart-horse. And then another 
delicate question took a few minutes&apos; consideration. Te Parehao 
wished to hook the traces in some loops of the supplejack binding, 
and perform the journey without a sledge. His companions 
remonstrated ; he would have no satisfaction when he reached the 
coast. The way was rough, and it would kill them. Te Parehao 
gave in reluctantly. When all was ready to start, he stated his 
intention of doing tne rest of the work alone ; rubbed noses with 
his two assistants ; and started on his way merry as a chief should be 
who is enjoying a thoroughly satisfactory revenge. 

The moon had done three-fourths of her night&apos;s journey when 
he reached the coast, and the strong salt air came pleasantly up over 



122 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOR, 

the cliffs into his nostrils. He estimated the number of capsizes on 
the way to be three. He never looked back ; but he heard the thud 
when the sledge struck anything and turned over, and the groans 
mingling with the traces&apos; rattle when the load possibly caught 
against a stump, or helped the sledge over a boulder. Then, when 
the horse became quieter, he guessed the sledge had got into its 
proper position again. 

At the commencement of a steep incline, that led down to a 
steeper cliJBF, Te Parehao stopped. He walked to the very edge and 
looked coolly over. 

&quot;Good enough,&quot; he said; and came back to relieve the sledge 
of its load. 

Then he uttered an exclamation. Either the supplejacks 
binding the two necks had worked loose, or the man&apos;s neck was 
broken, for the head had slipped down and rested on the shoulder 
of the woman, whose eyes looked up now — not into her lover&apos;s, but 
into her husband&apos;s. There was still life in her. 

&quot;Spare me,&quot; she pleaded weakly, in the native tongue. &quot;The 
man you would kill with me is already dead. Let me go ; and forget 
that you married me. I will go away ; only let me live — let me 
live until my turn comes to die.&quot; 

For answer, Te Parehao lifted her partner&apos;s head and placed 
the face against hers. 

&quot; Kish ! &quot; he said ; &quot; one good long kish.*&apos; 

She did not speak, but when the head slipped to the side again, 
her eyes turned on Te Parehao with reproach, and the lower part of 
her face was smeared with blood — blood not her own. 

&quot; Here ! here ! &quot; said the chief. &quot; Sure you no sham ? &quot; and he 
turned the pakeha&apos;s face up. 

Sham or no sham, one eye was glassy ; and where the other 
should have been there was a simple hole. Blood ran from the 
mouth, and clotted blood ran from the beard. 

&quot; Ha ! Never mind ! &quot; — and Te Parehao proceeded to undo the 
fastenings that bound the man and woman to the sledge. It did 
not take long. 



A STEP TOO HIGH. 123 

&quot;See ! &quot; and he pointed down the sloping bank, two hundred 
feet below the edge of which the sea lay, glistening invitingly under 
the moon. &quot; Quick way you go hell, eh ? Me gi&apos; you good shtart &quot; 
— and he began rolling them over. Five or six turns sufficed ; then 
they kept on without assistance, and he stood and watched the result. 
Presently the pace became hot ; and first the woman, then the man, 
was uppermost, whirling over and over and hurrying to the edge. 

It was days afterwards, and the sea rolled in lazily. On the 
sand, a flock of birds of all sorts and conditions ; in the water, 
sometimes out of sight, sometimes almost wholly to be seen, as each 
wave curled over, something which interested these birds greatly. 
A mermaid floating on her back with her lover in her armsl 
Perhaps so. At any rate, an old and dissipated-looking bird, 
watching with the crowd, turned to his better half and winked ; at 
which she looked the other way, as a girl who blushes modestly. 
Yet, when the waves had done with the two bodies, she was among 
the first to waddle hungrily for a closer inspection.

DIES IRAE. 

I 

IT was some millions of years after the great Judgment Day. 
Satan had been sleeping, and when he awoke he felt somewhat 

chilly. 

&quot; Confound those imps ! &quot; he exclaimed, &quot; I believe they Ve let 
the fires down a bit. A more careless set of devils I never had to 
do with in all my eternity. I&apos;ll give them particular sheol for this.&quot; 

As he spoke he touched the electric bell, and a few seconds 
afterwards a trapdoor in the floor fell open, and a devil, burnt to a 
rich terra-cotta by the eternal fires, shot into the presence of the 
Lord of Hell. 

&quot; How now, sir ? &quot; thundered the potentate ; &quot; do you think 
hell was meant to be an ice-house, that you let the fires down so 
low? You seem to have mistaken your vocation. The whole 
stoking department ought to have been angels with white robes and 
crowns of glory. What do you mean by it, anyhow ? &quot; 

The stoker-devil trembled like a leaf. &quot; May it please your 
majesty,&quot; he said, &quot;it isn&apos;t really our fault; the fact is, we are 
running out of fuel.&quot; 

&quot; What ! &quot; roared Satan, &quot; running out of fuel, with the whole 
universe to draw on ? &quot; 

&quot; We &apos;ve been using ten constellations a minute for the last 
three million years,&quot; explained the stoker ; &quot; and now the supply 
has given out. We kept the Milky Way till the last, hoping against 
hope, but this week we had to use it. We are running the furnaces 
now with the Magellan Clouds, but the quality is none of the best, 
and we &apos;11 want a fresh supply in a few hours.&quot; 

&quot;Search the ends of Space then!&quot; exclaimed Satan; &quot;there 
must surely be any quantity of constellations left.&quot; 

124 



DIES IR^. 125 

The stoker-devil shook his head sadly. &quot; We &apos;ve used &apos;em all 
up,&quot; he replied. &quot; Our cinder-heap reaches to the farthest depths.&quot; 

&quot; Search that cinder-heap then ! &quot; cried Satan ; &quot; plenty of suns 
and constellations may have been thrown out carelessly.&quot; 

&quot; No,&quot; replied the stoker-devil despondently ; &quot; during the last 
million years the ashes have been carefully sifted, and all burnable 
parts have been returned to the furnaces.&quot; 

Satan ground his mighty teeth in despair. &quot;This comes of 
damning too many souls,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot; I begin to think that I 
was far too active in the old days. If I had had any foresight at 
all I &apos;d have let the parsons save all the souls they wanted. Here I 
am brought to beggary in my old age — burnt out of house and home 
by a lot of miserable souls who have not the common decency to 
thank me for giving them the chance. But I will not submit ; I &apos;11 
strain the universe through a hair-sieve before I give up the game. 
Here, you ! — turn out ten thousand of those Australian miners we 
damned in the nineteenth century. Tell &apos;em to prospect all Space. 
Tell them I &apos;11 give threepence each for planets, and ninepence each 
for suns — in asbestos orders good for whisky at the refreshment- 
room. And, while they are routing around, I &apos;11 see what I can find 
on my own account.&quot; 

At once the message clanged throughout hell, but before the 
order could be carried out Satan took a header into the depths, on 
a quest of his own. In a few seconds thousands of eager souls 
swarmed out on to the clinker-heap. There they were, gaunt and 
grim, seared by millions of years of searching fires, grilled for ages 
on the unmelting fire-bars of the inferno, racked and torn by the 
tireless torturers, and hideously disfigured by a thousand endless 
and unimaginable torments But there they stood with the old 
prospecting fever still strong within them, and before them lay the 
biggest prospecting field ever offered to the sons of men. There lay 
an apparently duffered-out universe, with just a chance that some- 
where in it were constellations every sun of which was worth a 
drink in the private bar of hell ; and so, with a whoop that shook the 
grim portal of the inferno, they dashed into Space. 



126 THE BULLETIN STOBY BOOK, 

But little they reckoned of the task before them. For days 
they wandered, that troop of disconsolate diggers, and many a 
billion miles they prospected without success. At last, when the 
search seemed almost hopeless, something huge and filmy hove in 
sight on the great black wall of starless Space. With a simultaneous 
rush the prospectors went for it, and, hooking themselves on by 
every available point, they dragged it, with a wild hurrah, through 
billions of miles of emptiness till they triumphantly dumped it at 
hell&apos;s gate, and sent it bodily down into the furnaces. 

A stoker-imp rose up and thanked them, with tears in his eyes. 

&quot; Just in time, oh, just in time ! &quot; he exclaimed, in broken 
accents. &quot; The weather prophet in the third gridiron has prophesied 
a white frost.&quot; 

But suddenly a mighty form spun up from the exterior dark- 
ness. It was Satan, returned from a fruitless search. 

&quot; I hear the roar of the furnaces,&quot; he said ; &quot; what have you 
found?&quot; 

They told him. 

&quot; &apos; A filmy thing, floating in Space.&apos; Oh, fools ! &quot; he cried, 
&quot; you have gone and burnt up Heaven. It won&apos;t last ten minutes. 
We are lost ! &quot; 

And, sure enough, fifteen minutes later Hell froze over.

UNDER THE ROSE. 

OH, all you happy lovers 1 who may acknowledge one another 
before the world : have a pity for us the outcasts, who must 
meet and vow eternal constancy in secret, whose love 
prudence or morals forbids. Your path is so smooth ; you sit in 
snug drawing-rooms, and discreet coughs announce the approach of 
intruders. Everyone smiles on you and approves of you. We must 
descend to artifice, stratagem, and ruse. We advertise in the 
&quot; missing friends &quot; column, or hide letters in a log or a tree. You 
run to meet the postman, and smile openly and happily over 
love&apos;s eloquence. You are artless, frank, sincere. We — well, 
never mind what we are ; the words sound harsh. 

&quot; We loved, sir — used to meet : 

How sad and bad and mad it wjis— 

Bat, then, how it was sweet ! &quot; 

We meet by the grass-grown banks of a swift little creek, and 
from the shelter of tall bracken and rushes glance guiltily now and 
again over our shoulders — at what 1 A cow or a horse. And we 
scarcely dare whisper as we presently approach the homest-ead, and 
part under the shelter of that kindly old white gum. Or away on 
some lonely road, with not a habitation in sight, where the acres of 
dim country seem to slip into the far horizon under the moon ; the 
horses tied to the wire fence crop the grass, and the sheep, huddled 
together, bleat now and again, and we start, fearing someone. 

Or down by a cliff near the sea, the stars tracking a pathway 
across the water, which rises and falls, and whispers a crooning song 
to the gleaming line of sand. 

Or the city ; poor lovers when it is the city ! It is hard to find 
nooks for lovers in the city. In the big, kind country, when the 

127 



128 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

night falls, we have the wide miles and each other. Yet even the 
busy streets become dear when we have trodden them side by side, 
and the glamour falls over all that is prosaic and humdrum. But 
the marvellous charms of those secret meetings, the hair-breadth 
escapes from discovery, the dear jeopardy into which Love leads us, — 
they are something you can never know, happy lovers ! Does not 
the very openness and smoothness of your path render it common- 
place ! Do you value the prize so easily obtained ? Do you really 
know what Love is ? But what true lovers have not believed that 
to them alone has been revealed the length, depth, breadth, height 
and vastness of Love ? 

We used to think we knew it all ; even though we might not 
confess to each other, there were times when we believed we had 
reached the perfect happiness. Life had been cruel, would continue 
cruel, but Love had given all, and you whispered, &quot; If Death would 
come now ! &quot; 

But he did not come, and it has all gone far into the past, and 
we are humdrum, middle-aged people, and have not seen one another 
for twenty years. If Death had come then, it would have been 
better. Poor lovers ! 

There was a row of pines away across the paddock, and one 
slipped with stockinged feet along the verandah where the boards 
creaked, and down the lane so quietly, then past the sheds where a 
tall poplar dropped leaves that crackled underfoot. If there was a 
moon one kept close to the straggling hawthorn hedge, pausing 
with rapid pulse to listen if anyone was near ; — what miles it 
seemed when every step was fraught with danger, and each move- 
ment was made with deliberate caution ! Then across the strip of 
open where white logs lay on the ground, and one lingered fearfully 
by stump and tree, past the clump of saplings where sometimes hung 
a grave native-bear ; the tall, pale grass on each side stretching 
away in soft, indistinct waves. Then at last in the shelter of the 
pines, the dry ground beneath strewn with pine-needles, and the 
branches above murmuring a song they long ago taught ships to sing 



UNDER THE ROSE. 129 

at sea. Perhaps the tall masts were stalwart pines in their youth, 
and can never forget the forest-song which sweeps through solemn 
chant, murmuring dirge, requiem, lullaby, then swells into sonorous 
peal and blast of mad triumph or despair. 

One leaned against an old brown bole with its warm, resinous 
smell, listened and started at the falling of a twig ; across the quiet 
night came the far bark of a dog, the whirring of a cricket, the 
womp / womp ! of frogs in the dam, and blended with all the 
whisper and croon of the pines. At last you would come, your steps 
indistinct, — a moment of doubt, — then coming rapidly nearer. 
Then . . . well, you who are lovers know what then. 

What a soft cushion pine-needles make ! What a still, peaceful 
world we looked out on from the shadow while we talked of our- 
selves, and our love, and the risks we ran, or did not talk at all — 
and often that was best. The minutes that dragged in a very 
eternity of time while we were apart, were hurrying into an hour 
when we were together. 

&quot; I was afraid you could not come.&quot; 

&quot; I could not have stayed ; my heart was beating in a very 
madness of longing for you.&quot; 

**Do they suspect, do you think t&quot; 

&quot; I daresay. I do not care now.^^ 

A light twinkles far off — it is the home of a newly-wed pair. 

&quot; Ah, my dear — shall we ever . . . What is to be the end of 
it all?&quot; 

&quot; I dare n&apos;t think of it. I only live for the present, and from 
one meeting to another.&quot; 

&quot; Did you hear my step ? &quot; 

&quot; Yes — far off. At first I thought it was only the pulse in my 
ears, but it came nearer, and you are here.&quot; 

Well, it is all past now ; hot clasp, passionate kisses, clinging 
arras. Judge not too harshly, happy lovers ! We break our hearts, 
you see, and must lie and play the hypocrite, and meet by stealth ; 
and we try to do what is right very often, but, though you may not 



130 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

believe it, there are circumstances in which it is impossible to tell 
what is right. And Love is stronger than anything but Death, 
and perhaps it is stronger than Death also. Some day we shall 
know. 

Meanwhile we meet by stealth, and some of us do our best in a 
hard place, and some of us don&apos;t ; and when we suffer we wonder 
vaguely why Love and &quot; morals &quot; are so often opposed. Yet, if you 
are severe to those whom Love tempts too cruelly, you must also give 
credit to those — and they are not few — who withstand, and break 
their hearts. But, as they are probably broken either way, it does 
not matter much.

THE FUNERALS OF MALACHI MOONEY. 

A NUMBER of Bungaree farmers, called from the fields, stood 
bare-headed about the sick-bed ia attitudes of grievous 
constraint. Mrs. Mooney, seated on a low stool, wept 
sluice-heads, with wailing and querulous protestations. She had 
been replenishing the fountain of tears with whisky, and now 
cherished a great grievance against Malachi for dying, and the time 
chosen, and the manner thereof. 

&quot; There &apos;s hwhisky by the jar, min,&quot; said the dying man in a 
thin wheeze. &quot;Be dhrinkin*.&quot; 

Hogan gravely assumed authority over the jar, and filled up 
for the company with judicial impartiality. 

&quot;Good luck to ye, Mullocky ! ** said Hogan, raising his cup. 

Malachi waved his thin hand in expostulation. He was 
beyond all chances of fortune in this world, and knew it. Hogan 
temporised. 

&quot; Good luck to ye, Mullocky, fwhere ye &apos;re goin&apos;,** 

&quot;How dar&apos; ye doi, Mooney — how dar&apos; ye do id ? &quot; wailed Mrs. 
Mooney, throwing her apron over her head, and rocking her body to 
and fro. 

The company drank with one action, quite military in its 
precision, and then looked towards Malachi Mooney for further 
orders, and Malachi lay peacefully, happily dead with a smile on his 
lips, and the half-drained mug in his wasted fingers. 

&quot;Oh, ye divil! t&apos;be dyin&apos; on me like dthis,&quot; moaned Mrs. 
Mooney under her apron. &quot; I &apos;m disaved in yeh, Mooney ! disaved ! 
disaved ! Whurra whroo ! &quot; 

Presently, perceiving that Malachi was beyond argument, she 
lifted up her voice and filled the house with dolorous cries, and 



132 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

wailed dutifully and monotonously far into the night, when the 
chant was taken up by eerie, wrinkled old crones, smoke-dried 
grandmothers lent for the occasion by sympathetic families from the 
four quarters of the wilderness. 

What a wake that was ! It lasted all night, and right up to 
the time fixed for the funeral. There was no end to the willins: 
drinkers, and no limit to the whisky. Indeed, the miraculous 
manner in which tiny kegs, loaded to the bung, rolled from under 
the bed on demand, confirmed the local opinion that &quot; Mullocky &quot; 
Mooney had more than a finger in the snug still, the smoke from 
which curled so artfully up from a charred trunk on Peter&apos;s Hill, 
and was thoughtfully given a supernatural origin by the neighbourly 
people of the district. 

The funeral was advertised to move from the home of deceased 
at ten a.m. sharp. It was a long march to the Ballarat old cemetery, 
and an early start was deemed necessary in consideration of the fact 
that Hooley&apos;s funeral, which happened a month earlier, had been 
fined for furious driving, by reason of the anxiety of the mourners 
to reach the graveyard before closing time. 

The vehicles began to arrive at seven in the morning, the 
farmers and settlers driving, and their wives and &quot;childer&quot; loaded 
in behind. A funeral was a &quot; trate &quot; that did n&apos;t happen every day, 
and it would have been considered a sin to deprive the &quot; byes &quot; and 
&quot; gurrls &quot; of a bit of &quot; en jy mint &quot; that cost nothing. But many of 
the mourners had been at Mooney&apos;s all night, &quot; kapin&apos; the carpse 
company,&quot; and daybreak disclosed a baker&apos;s dozen scattered about 
the farm, sleeping where they fell. One hung over the dog-leg fence 
&quot; forninst &quot; the house, like an old shirt, with down-swinging arms. 
Canty, recumbent against the butt-end of a gum, rigid as a stump, 
slept so profoundly that the old guttural Brahmapootra had perched 
on his bald and awful head, and was defying creation with senseless 
repetitions of a cracked clarion Others reposed curled against 
the house, and several dotted the paddock like quaint hieroglyphics, 
objects of wonderment and noisy speculation to the familiar pigs. 



THE FUyEBALS OF MALACHI MOONET, 133 

Michael Morrissey was the first to drive up. Michael was to 
occupy an honourable and responsible position at the head of the 
procession. He had generously offered the use of his trap as hearse, 
and it was appropriately draped for that solemn office. This vehicle 
was an American waggon, and it had been roofed over about two 
feet from the floor, and was ordinarily used for the conveyance of 
meat ; Michael being a butcher. There was a door at the back, and 
just room within for Mooney&apos;s coffin. Quinn&apos;s trotter, The Imp, 
was in the shafts. The Imp had been borrowed for the occasion 
because he was the only black horse in the district ; but although 
his complexion was satisfactory, his disposition quite unsuited him 
for so grave a duty. He was old and had a semi-bald tail ; but 
there was a peculiar and aggressive jauntiness about the beast 
altogether out of harmony with his years and the situation in which 
he found himself. He held his head high, and pricked his ears, and 
his tail had a perky elevation that exhibited the bald butt to the 
worst advantage, and excited popular derision wherever he went. 

When the friends of the late Malachi Mooney arrived, they 
walked reverently into the room where Malachi lay still on the bed 
amidst his monumental candles, and gazed on him for a moment 
with pensive sadness, as in duty bound. 

** Pore mahn, he have the peaceful shmile on him ! ** 

&quot; He have, he have ! &quot; 

After repeating the sentiment several times, with nodding heads 
and much wise clicking of tongues, thus having paid their respects 
to the dead, they withdrew to the kitchen, and devoted themselves 
to the whisky. 

The coffin had been delivered, and stood on two bush stools in 
the kitchen, decently covered with a black shawl. Mrs. Mooney sat 
at the foot, adjacent to a pannikin, and continued to upbraid 
Mooney for his inconsiderate conduct in dying, and &quot; lavin&apos; a lone 
lorn widdy.&quot; 

The funeral moved at eleven, when it was quite certain that 
only one baby keg remained. This keg Morrissey took with him on 



134 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

the improvised hearse, as a wise provision for the first half of the 
journey, which lay through a barren land. 

Many of the mourners had to be helped into their vehicles, and 
after the start many remained in only by a miracle. Morrissey led 
the way. The Imp stepping along with a frivolous kind of a four- 
footed jig that robbed the cortege at the outset of any pretence to 
dignity. O&apos;Connor&apos;s old waggonette followed, O&apos;Connor driving 
carefully, strapped down ; and Mrs. O&apos;Connor and the &quot; widdy &quot; 
occupying the back seat. Then came Clark in his spring-cart, 
driving The Imp&apos;s rival. Colleen.^ After him two or three 
miscellaneous vehicles, and then a long string of wood drays, each 
in charge of an unnaturally rigid and solemn Irishman perched on a 
candle box, and each containing one or two women and three or 
four children, the former squatting composedly on the bottom of the 
dray with their substantial feet swinging out behind. A dozen 
sleepy, unshaven, unshorn agriculturists brought up the rear, 
riding two abreast on large, morbid horses that shuffled moodily 
through the dust with drooped heads and sagging under-lips. 

The women in the drays maintained a shrill conversation along 
the line, but for the most part the men observed an owl-like decorum 
until the Travellers&apos; Rest was reached, — that is, if the puffing of 
abbreviated black clays be not considered derogatory from true 
reverence. Meanwhile, the day being hot and the way dusty, a 
couple of short halts had served to drain the keg on the hearse. It 
was a gritty, drought-stricken funeral that descended upon the 
Travellers&apos; Rest, and when it moved again it left the wayside inn as 
dry as a powder-mill, having drunk up everything in the bar, and 
demolished the water-butt. 

And now a great spirit of unrest took possession of many of 
the mourners, and there was much whooping and many manifesta- 
tions of a wild and unholy desire to convert the procession into 
something like a steeplechase. The Imp was stepping out gaily 
with his deceitful double-shuffle, game as a pebble, despite his age 
and infirmities, but it was Clark with Colleen who led the break- 
away. 



THE FUNERALS OF MALACHI MOONEY. 135 

Springing up with a whoop and whooroo, Clark whipped his 
mare alongside the hearse. 

&quot;Morrissey,&quot; he cried, &quot;I can bate that bumble-footed ould 
crock to the Pint beyant fer tin bob ! &quot; 

&quot; Ye can&apos;t ! &quot; roared Morrissey, all the sportsman stirring 
within him. 

&quot; Ye loi ! &quot; Clark fairly shrieked, laying the whip on. 

Michael lashed The Imp, and the veteran, scenting a contest, 
snorted defiance, and hit out with all four afflicted legs at once. 
Then, bounding over ruts, jumping the boulders, rocking and rearing, 
the two vehicles went thundering through the dust, Colleen leading 
and The Imp following, flinging wide his legs with the action of a 
startled tarantula as he rushed down the hill, his body working with 
the antic spasms of two pigs in a bag. 

The other drivers flogged their stolid horses into unwonted 
activity, and in this way the mad funeral, strung out a mile long, 
tore through one affrighted township, scattering sows and sucklings, 
goats, dogs, poultry, and shrieking children, raising a dust that 
blotted out half the landscape, and filling men and women with a 
wonderment that lasted many days. Half a mile beyond, The Imp, 
with a triumphant tail and starting eyeballs, flung past the Colleen 
with a rush and a roar, neatly carrying away Clark&apos;s near wheel, 
which went humming ahead down the well-worn track. 

Morrissey obtained control over his blood horse and succeeded 
in pulling up about a mile further on, and there he waited for the 
rest of the funeral in a humble and contrite frame of mind. The 
procession arrived in sections, the heavy horses spent and reeking, 
and the mourners coated thickly with powdered clay that caked 
rapidly in the sun on their perspiring faces. The women, par- 
ticularly the stout ones, tumbled and bumped out of all knowledge 
and restraint, were loud and fierce in their complainings ; and the 
men agreed that it was &quot; ondacent &quot; and &quot; agin religion &quot; to conduct 
a funeral at a hard gallop. So Michael led away again, holding his 
trotter hard, and proceeded as reverently and demurely as possible 
with such a horse and so much whisky. 



136 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

Matty Clark was reported unharmed, and busy fixing a skid in 
place of the lost wheel It was expected that he would turn back, 
and be no more a disturbing element in his neighbour&apos;s funeral. 

The procession travelled into the outskirts of Ballarat without 
any further misadventure. In fact, most of the drivers and several 
of the ladies were asleep, and the weary plough-horses drowsed 
along at their own gait. The Imp, in spite of the apparent spright- 
liness of his action, was a very slow walker, for the reason that he 
generally dropped his hoofs in almost the spots from which he had 
just lifted them, and sometimes behind. 

But at this point, cries of warning and of wonderment and 
disgust ran along the line, and looking back, Morrissey beheld 
Matty Clark in the distance, erect in his cart, gesticulating like a 
maniac, and rapidly overhauling the funeral. Matthew had fixed a 
sapling under his trap for a skid, and on this and one wheel he 
presently rattled up alongside the hearse again, oblivious to the 
threats and expostulations of the mourners. 

&quot; Mike Morrissey, ye divil ye ! &quot; yelled Mat, red, panting, and 
furious, &quot; to the cemmethry fer a quid ! &quot; 

&quot; Niver a won av me,&quot; replied Morrissey, hanging on to 
The Imp. 

&quot;Yis, be the powers!&quot; roared Clark, shooting ahead, and 
slashing viciously at the hearse-horse as he passed. 

Michael clung to the reins, and hauled with all his might, but 
The Imp was not to be denied. Squealing shrilly in reply to the 
challenge, he broke into his old, ungainly, link-motion combination 
of canter, amble and trot, and spread himself all over the road in 
pursuit of Colleen. 

A couple of horsemen put their nags to a gallop to head-off 
Matty Clark, and in this way the funeral broke in upon Ballarat, 
careering down Humphrey-street, and stirring the city to its depths. 

Fortunately Colleen was headed just before reaching the main 
thoroughfare, and Daly and O&apos;Mara seized upon Matty, who was a 
small, bristly Hibernian, and fought like a peccary. They got him 



THE FUNERALS OF MALACHI MOONEY, 137 

down and tied him up. Then, after throwing their turbulent 
captive into the cart, O&apos;Hara sat on his chest and led the horses, 
and Daly, driving Colleen, now blown and humbled, took up a 
subordinate position at the tail of the procession ; while the funeral, 
which had paused to collect itself once more, moved on, followed by 
a delighted crowd of children and many envious adults. 

Many astonishing funerals had come up out of Bungaree into 
Ballarat East, but Malachi Mooney&apos;s funeral was the most weird 
and wonderful that ever invaded any town on the Australian 
continent, and news of it seemed to have electric passage through 
the place. The improvised hearse with the well-intentioned effort 
to rig a pair of plumes of cock&apos;s feathers upon it, the strange, jocund 
horse that hauled it, and the great, red, clayed-up, hairy, wild-eyed 
Galway man driving, were alone sufficient to have brought the 
whole population into Bridge-street ; but with the added attractions 
— the awful procession of drays, their dusty, kiln-dried occupants, 
and the last vehicle riding jauntily on its skid, the funeral simply 
stopped business, took possession of the town, and drew the 
people after it in crowds. 

Morrissey had the reins wound about his wrists, and with his 
heels dug in, his eyes protruding, and all his faculties intensely 
concentrated, hung to The Imp. The matrons still swung their 
stout feet, and here and there a worn-out mourner slept in his dray, — 
Heffernan and Moore with their heads suspended over the tail and 
their mouths open. The police followed too, and eyed the procession 
dubiously, half-inclined to arrest the whole funeral ; but by 
exercising the severest self-restraint and the greatest caution the 
mourners contrived to pull through, and arrived at the cemetery 
at half-past four, with the coffin in good order and condition. 

After the usual preliminaries, the coffin was carried to the 
graveside by four of the late Mooney&apos;s most intimate friends, and, 
considering all things, their progress down the path was not as 
devious as might have been expected, but they landed the pine 
casket with a dump that produced the greatest sensation of the day. 
The coffin lid had not been screwed down, and it slipped to one side, 



138 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

making a revelation. There were many cries and much commotion 
when it was seen that the coffin contained packages of sugar and 
tea and miscellaneous groceries, and nothing more. Malachi 
Mooney was not there ! Consternation sat whitely on every face, 
and the women crossed themselves vigorously. 

&quot; He &apos;s bin shpirited away ! &quot; wailed the &quot; widdy.&quot; 

&quot; Did annywon see us dthrop him ? &quot; asked the dazed Morrissey 
in a small, awed voice. 

Flynn now remembered that he had packed the groceries in the 
coffin the day before. He it was who carted the casket out from 
Ballarat ; and, having goods to carry at the same time, he packed 
them into the &quot; piner &quot; for &quot; convanience,&quot; and by reason of the 
thirst that came upon him and possessed him for two days &quot; dis- 
remimbered iviry thing aftherwards.&quot; 

In truth the late Malachi Mooney still lay undisturbed upon 
the bed in his humble home in Bungaree, and the last of the yard- 
long candles guttered in the brass-sockets at his head. The corpse 
had been forgotten ! 

And this is how Malachi Mooney came to have two funerals.

JUDAS: A STRIKE INCIDENT. 

JUDAS ! Here he comes — &quot;Judas, the traitor ! &quot; 
He passed among them with downcast head, glancing 
fearfully from side to side at the ominous, lowering faces. All 
reviled him ; the women spat upon him ; several of the men 
attempted to strike him. It wa-s all the two policemen could 
do to save him from the fury of the crowd. Presently 
stones began to fly. Most of them passed wide of the mark, 
but one of them found its billet. He reeled as the missile 
struck him; then, recovering himself, he broke from his escort, 
and rushed wildly down the narrow street, followed by a shower 
of stones and curses, and the execrating shouts of &quot;Judas! 
Judas ! &quot; 

It was the time of a great strike. The strikers knew not the 
curse of their heritage as they battled against starvation with ever- 
dwindling strength. 

It was reserved for one man to bring it home to them — one of 
their own number — a traitor — Judas ! He was the first to fail, as 
he had been the last to join them. In going back to the yoke and 
pittance, he paved the way for others to follow, one by one, until it 
seemed as if the long slow weeks of suffering and self-sacrifice had 
been once ipore in vain. 

Can you wonder that they hated him 1 And the Law of the 
land —the Law which put forth all its powers to thrust them back 
into the abyss — can you wonder that they hated that too, and 
rebelled against it ? 

And h£j the traitor 1 Ah, these are not merely the execrations 
of a handful of betrayed brethren that greet him to-night : they are 

189 



140 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

the voices of unborn generations which send up, as he slinks along, 
that universal shout of &quot;Judas ! Judas ! &quot; 

Later he stands hatless, beneath a lamp in the deserted street. 
His face is smeared with blood where the stone struck him. He 
has had more than one bitter experience this evening. Soon after 
he escaped from his pursuers he staggered, sick and faint, into a 
hotel. The bar was filled with men, many of whom were strikers, 
though he failed to notice them till it was too late to retreat. He 
reeled to the counter. 

&quot;Give me some brandy, quick,&quot; he said, &quot;for the love 
of God ! &quot; 

The bottle was passed to him in silence. The room had been 
filled with clamour when he entered ; now an ominous silence 
prevailed. He would have given worlds to search the assemblage 
for one pitying, relenting face ; but he dared not lift his eyes. He 
hastily swallowed the spirit and thrust a coin across the counter. 
Then a voice was heard. 

&quot; What, Hennessy, would you touch his cursed silver — blood 
money?&quot; 

The publican hesitated. His sympathies were with the men 
on strike, yet he could not help feeling some faint sense of pity for 
the abject wretch before him. But pity at times is an unprofitable 
sentiment. He flicked the coin back again. 

&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;he has had the drink; but I will not touch 
his money ! &quot; 

&quot; Curse you ! &quot; cried the hunted wretch, as he shivered the 
glass upon the floor. &quot; Oh, curse you all ! &quot; — and he rushed from the 
place, followed by derisive laughter. 

He is recalling the scene now, as he stands beneath the street- 
lamp, with the rain pattering upon his uncovered head. 

&quot; My God ! &quot; he cries, &quot; I cannot stand this much longer.&quot; 

Later still. He is walking, he knows not whither, although 
the street seems familiar. In truth he is close to the factory. 



JUDAS: A STRIKE INCIDENT. 141 

Suddenly he hears a sound of sobbing, A child — a little boy — is 
crouched against the fence, crying bitterly. 

&quot;What is the matter?&quot; he asks. 

The child tells him — he is lost. 

&quot;Come with me,&quot; he says; &quot;I will take you home.&quot; He 
knows the boy — for more than twelve months he worked beside his 
father in the factory. 

The child gives his hand trustingly, and they go on together. 
A little further on he stops to look at his watch, and the boy gets a 
glimpse of his face. 

Instantly the child endeavours to wrest himself free, at the 
same time crying out, in terror, &quot; Let me go ! — let me go ! &quot; 

&quot;What is the matter?&quot; he asks. &quot;Come with me; I will 
take you home.&quot; 

&quot; No, no ! &quot; exclaims the child, beating frantically the detaining 
hand, &quot; not with you — I know you. You are Judas I &quot; 

Instantly he releases the boy. 

&quot; Even the children ! &quot; he groans. &quot; Oh, God, I am heavily 
punished ! ** 

He is at the door of his lodgings. Although it is very late 
now, there is a faint light within. He opens the door softly and 
enters. As he is passing up the passage, the door of the sitting- 
room opens and his landlady calls him. 

&quot; I have been waiting up for you, sir,&quot; she says as a beginning. 
&quot; I am very sorry to have to do anything unpleasant ; you have 
been near two years now in my house, sir, but I must give you 
warning. You see, sir,&quot; she went on, seeing that he was about to 
speak, &quot; it &apos;s the other boarders. They &apos;ve heard about you going 
back to the factory, and to-night they all came to me and said that 
they would not live in the same house as a * scab,&apos; and that if you 
did not go to-night they would all leave in the morning ; and so 
you see, sir, I could do nothing else except to ask you, although I 
am sorry to lose you, if &quot; 

&quot; To-night ! &quot; he said, bitterly, &quot; they are in a hurry — to-night ! &quot; 



142 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

*&apos; If you please, sir, that &apos;s what they said, and if you can make 
it convenient to go, sir — there is that little matter of arrears, we 
would call that square.&quot; 

&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, turning on his heel abruptly, &quot;I will 
think over it.&quot; 

&quot; To-night ! &quot; he muttered, as he lit the candle in his own 
room ; &quot; to-night ! Ah well, as well to-night as to-morrow, or the 
next day.&quot; 

In the morning a small crowd gathered in the street. 

&quot; Poor fellow ! &quot; said a woebegone woman who was nursing a 
wan and woebegone infant ; &quot; poor fellow ! &quot; 

&quot; You pity him ! &quot; exclaimed a man at her side ; &quot; only for him 
we should have won. As it is — look at me, look at yourself, look 
at the child, half-starved now, and likely to be whole-starved soon, 
thanks to him — and you pity him ! &quot; » 

And one by one the crowd took the question up, and discussed 
it ; for by this time the news was generally known. 

Judas, the traitor, had hanged himself. 

E. F. Squires. 



HE LET HIS HEART GO. 

THE wind whistled, and every now and then threw a splash of 
sleety rain against the fissured face of a bleached, grey rock. 
A cavity in its centre looked to the south-west, whence wind 
and rain came ; and although the hole extended a good way, the 
chill gusts occasionally reached the farthest corner. Gyp Pringle 
crawled back as far as possible and built up a barricade of coarse 
packing-paper which he had carried on his back from Sydney ware- 
houses. 

Dog- weariness made him sleep. He had tramped tfkwn and 
HnbiMJfnt all day in search of work — the gate to bread and beef and, 
mayhap, ale. As he closed his eyes the rattle of reed and brass 
music was borne across the Domain from the precincts of Govern- 
ment House. * 

Soon he dreamed. What a heaven of gratifications spread 
before him ! Beef, potatoes, ale, whisky, tobacco. He stretched 
out a hungry hand. Alas ! he awoke. 

Realising the cruel hoax, he kicked viciously. To his surprise 
his foot struck something soft, a composite of flesh and blood, and a 
plaintive whine made humble protest. 

&quot; Now, then,&quot; said Gyp, &quot; who the devil are you ? This hole &apos;s 
mine. No doubt you &apos;re a Socialist. Well, clear out ! I did n&apos;t 
slope roun&apos; town an&apos; hump this here swag o&apos; old paper an&apos; root out 
this bloomin&apos; marble hall for the benefit o&apos; the community at large. 
I done it for meself. I &apos;m an individualist — I am. So take yerself 
to gaol or glory out o&apos; this.&quot; 

Only heavy breathing answered. 

&quot; D &apos;ye want me to bash yer ? G&apos; up to Guv&apos;ment House, can&apos;t 
yer ? They &apos;re singin&apos; and coortin&apos; up there, I believe, an&apos; ye might 

143 



144 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

be able to collar a fan or spoon when nobody &apos;s lookin&apos;. Clear out, 
I say ! &quot; 

This time the whine became a subdued bark, and a cold nose 
was thrust into his hollow hand. 

&quot; Me bloomin&apos; &apos;ead ! ye &apos;re a dawg ! An&apos; I took ye all the time 
for a Socialist ! I beg parding humbly. All the same though — out 
ye go. If a coal-heaver snooked into &apos;Ampden&apos;s, out he &apos;d go. An&apos; 
as this hole &apos;s my castle, out you go ! An&apos; if you had a kennel an&apos; I 
attempted to snook in, out / &apos;d go. See ? We &apos;re all individualists.&quot; 

He kicked. 

&quot; Sometimes though, notwithstanding me logic, I &apos;ve thought 
that if those on top were a bit kinder to the folk below, it might be 
better all round. It &apos;s not me brain says that ; it &apos;s me heart.&quot; 

He kicked again. 

&quot;If, when a coal-heaver snooked into Governor &apos;Ampden&apos;s, 
&apos;Ampden gave &apos;im time to draw breath before firin&apos; &apos;im out; or 
when I snooked into the coal-heaver&apos;s, or when this outcast dawg 
snooked in here &quot; 

He drew up his foot smartly. 

&quot; Well, now,&quot; he said, sitting up, &quot; dammut, but I &apos;11 give me 
heart her way for onst. Let her go, Gallagher ! &quot; 

When daylight came Gyp examined his partner in adversity, 
and recognised that the dog belonged to a lady in whose garden he 
had done a couple of days&apos; work a week or two before. This he 
considered an extremely gratifying discovery. 

&quot; Me bloomin&apos; &apos;ead ! &quot; he exclaimed ; &quot; this means a big reward, 
if it does n&apos;t lead to a constant job, with a liberal pension for me 
old age ! &quot; 

Laying hold of a piece of rope and looping it round the 
famished creature&apos;s neck, he continued : 

&quot; It &apos;s a pound if it &apos;s a thankee. No doubt the dawg &apos;s been 
lost for a time, for his hair &apos;s peelin&apos; off. He &apos;s seen the inside o&apos; 
Belmore more &apos;n onst, I &apos;11 go bail. An&apos; to think I struck this patch 
o&apos; luck the first time I let me heart go ! This &apos;11 make a different 



HE LET HIS HEART QO. 145 

man o&apos; me for the future. * Do a kind hact &apos; will be my motter. 1 
venture to say most people with that motter found a dawg to start 
them. Come along, old boy ; otF to Darlin&apos; Point to reap the 
reward o&apos; virtue ! Yer mistress &apos;11 be that glad to see yer face that 
she &apos;11 likely keep me for dinner an&apos; fit me in a suit o&apos; good, dry 
clothes.&quot; 

*&apos; What have you to say ? &quot; asked the spectacled magistrate. 
&quot; That dawg came to me under a rock in the Domain, an&apos; &quot; 



&quot; There &apos;s too much of this going on. You obtained work in 
this lady&apos;s garden with the clear intention of making friends with 
the dog. You were seen about the place several times since. Then 
you induce the dog off and keep him in your low haunts until a 
reward is offered. Sydney is cursed with loafers of your stamp. 
Three months&apos; hard labour.&quot; 

Said Gyp : &quot; This is the first time I ever let me heart go, an&apos; 
if ever &quot; 

But he was hauled away, crying at the top of his voice : &quot; I &apos;m 
an individualist for the rest o&apos; me bloomin&apos; life, I am ! &quot; 

Omicron. 



H 



THE SQUARE RING: 

AN IDYLL OF LITTLE BOURKE-STREET. 

WHEN Aggie had persuaded Chuck Maroney to marry her, 
she did up her hair. &quot; I ain&apos;t takin&apos; no risks,&quot; she 
explained ; and at the critical moment she said she was 
twenty-one in so artless a manner that even the shabby, red-nosed 
parson, who had been passed by thirty-two congregations to land at 
Smith&apos;s Matrimonial Agency, held for a moment the sincere thought 
that she looked very young. At the time for fitting on the ring 
Chuck indignantly scorned the aluminium circlet proffered by the 
Agency — &quot; &quot;Weddings, with duly qualified clergyman and ring 
provided, 10s. 6d.&quot; — as the advertisement ran. &quot;Ef this here&apos;s 
gointer be done at all, it&apos;s gointer be done in style,&quot; he said 
proudly ; and he ostentatiously drew from his waistcoat-pocket 
another ring — gold this time, and of strength and weight sufficient 
to restrain a horse. 

Chuck was impressive in his bearing as he carefully fitted the 
ring on the girl&apos;s finger ; and it was with the manner of one treading 
on air that he asked the clergyman across the road after the 
ceremony, &quot; ter join me and the missus in a long-&apos;un.&quot; 

On the tram, going home, the bride proudly kept her fat brown 
fist clenched on her knee with the heavy gold band uppermost — 
shining out and proclaiming to all the world that she had fulfilled 
her destiny. 

Chuck did n&apos;t trouble to go to Ginger Macauley&apos;s for a barrow 
of fruit that day. &quot; We done our honeymoon six months ago,&quot; said 
Aggie when he suggested the formality ; but he maintained that 
something of the sort was necessary for the sake of appearances. So 
Mr. and Mrs. Maroney compromised on an afternoon&apos;s trip to 

146 



THE SQUARE RING. 147 

Beaumaris — &quot; the round trip 28. 6d.&quot; (as extensively advertised by 
the Victorian Railway Department) being seized upon as the most 
economical form of honeymoon extant. 

The sands of Sandringham, the long, meandering avenue of 
dark green ti-trees enclosing the tram-line, the brown cliffs of 
Beaumaris themselves — looking like a bit of Sydney Harbour lifted 
up and set down in the midst of the wastes of Port Phillip 
bay — all seemed invested with beauty more intense than ever ; 
and away between the brown and green tints of the land the 
sea lay beneath the sun smooth and pale-blue, with a bloom on 
it like a ripening plum. It was at Beaumaris that they had their 
wedding breakfast ; and it was in the soft, mossy groves along the 
cliffs that they told their love over again and forgot that such a 
place as Little Bourke-street ever existed, or that the curse of 
working for a living had ever fallen on mankind. 

Below on the sand they took off their boots and stockings 
and paddled like children, and with the combined influences of 
love and happiness and sea-air became so hysterically intoxicated 
that Aggie &quot;chucked-off&quot; in a particularly nasty way at the porter 
at Cheltenham, and a stand-up fight between him and Chuck was 
narrowly averted in consequence. 

At the city, it was oysters and stout at Billy the Greek&apos;s, 
a fruit-supper next door, and a bottle of wine at Francesco&apos;s ; 
and it was close on midnight when Chuck and Aggie turned from 
Little Bourke-street into Hogan&apos;s-place — the one spot in all Mel- 
bourne that resembles the &quot; courts &quot; so common in the big English 
towns. There was a crowd in front of Levy&apos;s door, and there were 
loud voices there, rising from the circle of black, flat figures that 
dodged around the lights in Levy&apos;s cart. 

&quot; Pull out, pull out ! &quot; whispered Aggie j &quot; it &apos;s on&apos;y the ole push. 
Slip in without &apos;em seein&apos; yer.&quot; 

But the old push — always eager to impress on everybody that 
it &quot;knew somethin&apos; &quot; — stood to its self -given reputation in this 
instance ; and the attempt of the newly-married couple to avoid the 
meeting was seen. 



148 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot;Wher&apos; to, Chuck?&quot; asked Arty Doolan ; &quot;there&apos;s a beer 
waiting for yer here, an&apos; we was just goin&apos; ter drink the health av 
you and the missus.&quot; 

The man paused, irresolute ; but at that moment there peeped 
from behind the cart the sleek black head and piercing eyes of &quot; the 
Zulu &quot; — one of the girls at the Black Angel, and one whose company 
Chuck Maroney used much to affect before he met Aggie. 

Aggie saw the dark, handsome face, and pressed her husband&apos;s 
elbow. &quot; Come along,&quot; she whispered. But the wliisper reached 
the Zulu, and she stepped out. &quot; Come along,&quot; she laughed ; &quot;we &apos;re 
an hones&apos; woman now, ain&apos;t we ? Our old pals ain&apos;t clars enough 
for us. You poor silly little fool, you had to make Chuck Maroney 
marry you. He tried to make me marry him. Me ! — me marry 
Chuck Maroney ! &quot; and in the dead silence of the square her pitiless 
laugh rang up hard from the stone pitchers. &quot; Poor silly little fool ! 
you an&apos; yer fine husban&apos; ! Why, he was mine afore ever he was 
yours ; an&apos;, marriage an&apos; all, he &apos;s mine to-morrow if I say the word.&quot; 

A bottle flashed up, and the blood fled from Aggie&apos;s face, 
leaving it white and horrifying. &quot; Knock off ! &quot; she yelled ; &quot; or I &apos;11 
shot this in yer mouth.&quot; 

Chuck seized the weapon from his wife, and as the Zulu saw 
his hand close upon it she leaped forward, and her white fist swept 
grazingly across Aggie&apos;s face. Though ill-aimed, the blow was 
heavy, and Aggie staggered back to recover herself against the wall. 
There her face fell within the focus of Levy&apos;s lamp, and the change 
was plain. The jolly, reckless look she usually wore, the grey rage 
that the words of the Zulu had called up, had both disappeared. 
Instead was a calm, determined expression, almost masculine, and 
as she stepped out again, with the right arm square across her waist 
and her left elbow flapping at her side, the Zulu quailed. Aggie 
was no longer the easy-going little larrikiness of week-days ; no 
longer the infuriated, insulted wife. She was a fighter pure and 
simple. 

Unversed in the art of conflict, the barmaid ran wildly forward 
with her head down, spitting in her temper, and lashing out blindly

with both hands. Aggie knew her opportunity. She stepped aside, 
swung the whole weight of her body into her left hand, and the 
Zulu rolled over on the stones. From chin to cheek ran a deep red 
line that grew deeper as they watched ; and Aggie, laughing in her 
triumph, glanced from the face of her adversary to her left hand. 
Then raising it high above her head, she threw it suddenly down- 
wards, and as the few red drops fell to the pitchers, she nestled to 
her husband&apos;s side, and, holding up her hand, smeared with blood 
across the four knuckles, said softly, &quot; It was the ring that done it, 
Chuck ; aincher glad yer married me now ? &quot;

DOLLY. 

WHEN an English King knighted the Sir Loin of British 
Beef he was probably ignorant of the august precedent 
of a Roman ruler, who intended to raise a British oyster 
to consular rank, but, on reflection, decided that the honour was an 
inadequate one. To enjoy a plate of oysters is a proof of culture ; 
to enjoy a barrel, a proof of complete culture. But of late there had 
been rumours of chemically-concocted imitations of the delightful 
bivalve. With the advent of the manufactured article, an awful thing 
of slimy loathsomeness, surely good taste would pass away, and 
there be left no desire to train the palate for the mermaid embrace 
of this delicate softness in armour. So I mused as, one by one, the 
Sydney Rocks were shrined in an appreciative grave. 

&quot;Good Lord! Dolly!&quot; 

The words shaped themselves in my throat, clattered up 
against the roof of my mouth, and almost found utterance. But 
the sight of what came after drove them back to the limbo of things 
unspoken. It was certainly Dolly ; Dolly looking even more rounded 
and voluptuous than she had looked an odd dozen or so months 
before. But he that followed was as surely her husband, a husband 
still under the glamour of a honeymoon preserved by passion or art 
beyond its decent and proper limit of thirty days. And — Great 
Heavens ! would the procession never end 1 — there came filing into 
the shop a third, a handmaiden of Yenus Genetrix, bearing in her 
arms the baby of Dolly, and the evident pride of Dolly&apos;s husband. 
Confounded, I watched the entrance of the nurse-girl, half expecting, 
half fearing the doorway to be darkened by yet another. 

&quot; Will the line stretch out to the crack of doom ? &quot; 

A dreadful vision of a matronly Dolly, followed by scores of 
maids, each burdened by an infant that wagged a tiny finger of 

160 



DOLLY. 151 

reproach, oppressed me for a moment. Then I saw that the 
procession had ended. There was but one baby and one husband. 
Still, the idea of Dolly with a husband and a baby . . . and only 
eighteen months since. ... It was surprising, even alarming. 

The husband seemed swelling with fatuous pride, resembling 
fantastically the Sydney Rock on my plate, which puffingly pushed 
out its ample cream-coloured waist from a flat shell, as though the 
kindness of the Oyster Fates were favouring its destiny. He was fair 
and beefy ; and the proprietary air with which he viewed his wife and 
his baby was as obvious as his necktie. That, a royal purple shot 
with brilliant green, wailed fearfully or shrieked exultantly as it 
caught the light obliquely or directly. Dolly came to me with out- 
stretched hand and a smile which showed two rows of white, even 
teeth, specked in three places with gold. (The history of those 
specks I could have told with absolute devotion to detail. I cannot 
recall whether I still possess the invoice.) There was not a 
suggestion of diffidence in her face. Her eyes did not plead : they 
boldly commanded. 

&quot; This, Dick &quot; (Of course, his name was Dick. Men who look 
like that always are &quot; Dick &quot; !) &quot; is Mr. Brice, an old friend of mine. 
Mr. Brice — my husband, Mr. Moxman.&quot; 

I felt confused, ashamed, afraid to take the hand of the honest 
fellow in front of me. But Dolly was imperturbable. I had to 
accept the proffered hand and submit mine to its warm grasp ; to 
refuse would have seemed strange, even suspicious to Mr. Moxman. 
Though, on reflection, I could no more think of suspicion as possible 
in his mind than I could imagine a pearl under the vest of the fine 
oyster, the last of its dozen, which still pushed out its stomach as a 
suggestion to mine, — losing, I thought, a little of the first sleek look 
of content as I continued to delay the devouring of it. 

They stayed half-an-hour or so. Moxman told me, admiringly, 
how his wife doted on oysters — &quot; not a common taste in women.&quot; 
It seemed to him distinctly genteel. I was tempted to tell him in 
return how the oyster is the touchstone of character, by which 
the shop-girl and the theatre-girl are judged ; a taste for the bivalve 



152 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

is significant of much. But why should I play the Serpent in a 
Fool&apos;s Paradise ? The baby, of course, had to be admired, and its 
striking resemblance to Dadda noted. When the maid brought the 
little germ of a sinner up for admiration, Moxman suggested that 
perhaps &quot; the girl &quot; would like some prawns. Mrs. Moxman frowned 
the idea down. 

At last they went, he gloating over his wife with greedy eyes, 
the nurse-maid following with the defiant humility of an Australian 
servant. 

Now, at Deluigi&apos;s you get the finest oysters in all the city of 
Sydney ; the only Tasmanian trumpeter that can make an English- 
man forget the turbot ; and schnapper of sentimental plumpness. 
But I was forced to resolve upon an abandonment of this home of 
salt delights. I could not risk meeting Dolly again. To sacrifice 
Deluigi&apos;s was to lose something of life. Yet, after all, one must 
sooner or later pay for one&apos;s pleasures. After eighteen months the 
price of that rosy fortnight at Lake Macquarie had to be paid. 

Saddened by the thought of this sacrifice on the altar of a dead 
ecstasy, I thought bitterly of Dolly, her husband, and the baby, 
going home. I could see her as she swam proudly by his side, and 
hear her as she asked him if he had noticed how confused and red I 
had been. &quot; Poor Mr. Brice ! He was an old admirer of mine. 
For twelve months he teased me something dreadful to marry him. 
He is not a bad-looking fellow, — though, of course, nothing like you, 
Dick.&quot; (This with an admiring look aloft). &quot; He has, too, no end 
of money ; but, you know, Dick &quot; (with a squeeze of the arm which 
she held) &quot; I always had an ideal, and until I met you &quot; 

When they reached home, I could imagine the hot and flustered 
nursemaid asking to be allowed to go out that night, and being 
refused by the indignant little matron, who tells her how wrong it 
is for young women to go out unaccompanied, and hints darkly as 
to what may happen to girls guilty of such wrong. 

A woman is never ashamed, but when necessary she can appear 

to be.

CAUGHT ON THE BEACH. 

IN the spring of ^^T, I was in Greymou^j-MrET For a young 
man just freed from the heat of Nop^h Qaooii&apos;sliind there was 

plenty to see and to do. The town is inconsiderable, but there 
is a noble river for bathing and boating. The bush-clad hills and 
narrow limestone caves are delightful ; while to walk out along the 
mile-long breakwater, and watch the giant breakers rush surging 
in, gives an experience not easily to be paralleled elsewhere. 

One day old Tainui, the Maori &quot; odd man &quot; at my hotel, started 
out for Point Elizabeth, a rocky headland some six miles up the 
north coast, to try a new lobster-pot he had made out of green 
supplejacks. We crossed to Cobden, an obsolete township on the 
north side of the Grey River, and here I foolishly gave old Tainui 
half-a-crown to get some rum. He got the rum and carried it, 
walking just behind me ; and, after half-an-hour or so, he calmly lay 
down by the roadside, handing over to me with Maori gravity the 
empty rum bottle and the lobster-pot and bait. 

Mentally cursing the old fellow, I pushed on. I had never 
been to Point Elizabeth, but it had been indicated to me from the 
steamer&apos;s deck, so I knew I was right when, after a couple of hours&apos; 
tramp, I arrived at a rocky island surmounted at one end by a 
natural tower of rocks crowned with some tough bushes. The tide 
was just low enough for me to reach the fishing pools on the island, 
and in a few minutes I had baited my trap, moored it securely in a 
nice deep pool, and was quietly sitting down eating the lunch I had 
brought. 

I had no lack of luck. Lobsters, or rather crayfish, were 
plentiful ; and my first haul was three beauties. I had forgotten to 
take the bag from old Tainui ; but I tipped them into a securely 

163 



154 ^^^ BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

isolated pool in the table of rock from which I was fishing. Soon 
I had a couple of dozen crayfish in my extemporised aquarium, 
fighting and tumbling over each other ; and, growing tired of such 
easy sport, I started to explore the rest of the little island. 

Just then I discovered a curious thing. The pool I had my 
crayfish in was at the foot of a little wall of smooth rock some 
twelve feet high. Extending to within an inch of this wall, and in 
such a position as to half cover the pool I was using, was a huge flat 
piece of detached rock which, as I clambered upon it, I found to be 
just on the balance. It was, in fact, a &quot; rocking stone.&quot; 

Here was a discovery. The mass was some ten or fifteen feet 
across ; and, by shifting my weight some two or three feet on each 
side of the centre, I found I could rock the stone to and fro in a novel 
kind of see-saw. The rocking-stone sloped sharply down where it 
approached the little wall ; and, going over to examine that side of 
it, my foot slipped from under me and I came bang against the wall. 
The impact momentarily released the rocking-stone ; my right foot 
slipped in between the stone and the wall; and, as I took the 
weight of my body on my left, down came the stone again and I was 
a prisoner ! 

I could not take my weight off the rocking-stone, for there 
was no crevice in the smooth wall above me to which I could 
cling. I could not spring up to relieve the stone of my weight, for 
my right foot was jammed, and my left, being between it and the 
wall, was rendered useless — even if the stone, instead of sloping 
sharply down, had been flat enough to get a footing for a jump. 

The pain, too, was intolerable. The space between the cliff and 
the stone was less than two inches, and I had the prospect of being 
slowly drowned as the tide rose. 

Execrating my luck, I considered possible means of escape. I 
had my knife, and if I could cut away my boot I thought surely I 
could wrench my foot free. I got out the knife, and, after a lot of 
trouble, cut away my boot and sock. Then I got as good a 
purchase as I could with my free foot, and tugged and wrenched 



CAUGHT ON THE BEACH. 155 

and tried to spring. No use ; the harder I pressed with my free foot 
the greater the pressure on the rocking-stone and the tighter 
the jamb. 

So I waited and waited. My foot was, of course, torn and 
bleeding, but so tightly compressed as to be almost without pain. 
By-and-by the tide began to come in, and I found myself stupidly 
wondering how long it would be before it reached my mouth ; and 
whether Tainui would recover his senses and liberate me — or my 
remains. I pictured to myself my skeleton, and wondered whether 
my head would fall o£f first, or if I would float off from where I was 
jammed. 

Then I fell into a kind of dozing stupor, and some hours must 
have passed, for presently I woke to find the spray dashing over my 
face. Then I discovered that feeling had come back to my foot. 
Slowly I grew conscious of a cutting, pinching sensation, and, 
looking through the crevices, I saw — the crayfish were grappling 
and beginning to eat my toes ! 

The agony of that time ! I yelled idiotically at the brutes, 
forgetting they could not hear. I tried to stamp with my free foot, 
and then, the horror of the thing overcoming me, I cursed and 
yelled like a maniac. 

Suddenly, during a lull in the booming of the surf, the 
echo of my despairing coo-ee came back to me from the foothills. 
Fool that I was not to have called out before, I thought ; there 
might be someone within range. I had lungs like leather, and, 
quickened by hope and maddened by the attacks of the lobsters, 
I sent out a succession of coo-ees that fairly lacerated the 
atmosphere. 

Just as I was on the point of desisting, a figure appeared on 
the beach. I thought of Tainui, but no ! the figure was a woman&apos;s, 
and my heart sank as I reflected that she would be powerless to 
help. By this time the spray from the breakers was flying over my 
head incessantly. No sooner, however, had the woman made out 
for certain that there was someone on the rock than she set about 



156 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

rescue. Quickly she discarded her short and scanty costume and 
entered the surf. Cleverly she breasted the rollers, taking full 
advantage of the undertow and diving through the worst of the 
breakers, until she gained the rock and came stepping along its 
slippery surface. 

As she neared me, I wondered. She was nearly full-grown, 
her body and limbs displaying the perfection of athletic womanly 
grace. She could not be a Maori — or a half-caste, even — she was 
too light. And she surely was not a European, for she betrayed no 
token of shame at standing thus nude before a man. 

Quickly she learned my plight, and like a Trojan set herself to 
free me. She ran to the opposite end of the stone, and, though the 
breakers were now beating on it, tried to bear it down so that my 
end would tilt up and release me. Her weight was not enough, 
but as active mentally as she was physically, she sang out, &quot; Hang 
out as well as you can while I go for a sapling.&quot; 

Though every second seemed like a minute to me, the novelty 
of this turn in the adventure took my mind off the pain sufficiently 
to let me admire the girl&apos;s strength and agility. Lord, how she 
swam ! Sometimes I would see her on the curl of a breaker, 
side-arming ahead like a steam-engine. Then, as the wave broke, I 
would catch sight of her head as she shook her long hair back and 
gamely breasted the undertow. Soon she gained the shore and, wet 
and bare as she was, ran along the beach out of my sight. When 
she reappeared she had in her hand a tomahawk, and made across 
the shingle bank into the scrub that bounds the beach. She soon 
returned with a long, stout sapling. 

How she lugged this heavy green stick through the surf over to 
the island where I was ; how she inserted the end in the crevice 
alongside my foot and prized away that dreadful rock, must 
be imagined, for T cannot describe it. What I know is that she 
got me ashore just after dark, and, my foot being fearfully injured 
(the crayfish took part of two of my toes — old Dr. Morrice took the 
rest), she extemporised a pair of crutches and took me home to her 
father&apos;s hut. 



CAUGHT ON THE BEACH. 157 

Here, in exchange for my own, I learned his history, which 
included, of course, that of his half-wild girl. His name was 
Tregarthen — a Cornishman ; had been a miner ; was a beachcomber 
on the seventeen-mile beach. She had grown up what Mrs. Grundy 
would call a regular heathen ; till in her seventeenth year, though 
she could neither read, write, sew, nor dress herself decently, and 
knew no more of religion or civilisation than a troglodyte, she could 
shoot, fell a tree, &quot; wash &quot; the black-sand, dig in the garden, and 
swim like an otter. 

I stayed at the house until the packer brought out a horse to 
carry me into town and to the hospital. And now . . . now my 
plain-spoken friends tell me that it was all a scheme, that I went 
fishing for lobsters and caught something that holds a good deal 
tighter even than a lobster — a wife. However, as the same friends 
rave about the beauty of my wife&apos;s face and figure, I am satisfied, 
because I, who first saw her shining like a water-goddess on the 
rocks at Point Elizabeth, know that their praise is true. 

Brogden. 



YARRAWONGA: ON THE MURRAY. 

WHAT more pleasant than this river-solitude among the 
whispering red-gums, to swim or loiter or dream in, this 
serene Sunday morning. &apos;T is the only church I love, 
and I am a devout listener. My bright-eyed little friend, the 
woodpecker, shall preach me a sermon, and a magpie shall sing me 
his doxology, and the infinite deep of blue sky shall be my Amen, 

Here let me lie, then, with the roots of this big tree for my 
pillow, and marvel awhile at the delicate filigrane of bronze and 
chrysolite leaves above me, laid upon the azure air like rare tracery 
upon some antique vase. The air is wine-like and warm ; and the 
endless beauty of life, and the mystery of its myriad forms, fill me 
with their wonder. O leaves, and wings, and antennse, and stones, 
bring me closer to your great, open secret of Joy and Life ! 

Multitudes of ants visit me ; the big, black, warlike recon- 
noitrers, and their red-nosed brethren out of yon tree, climb over 
me ; little emmets go a-foraging in the folds of my garments, and 
lady-birds come and walk over my hands and my book and fly away 
again into the great unknown of poetry and blue air and forest 
whence they came. Moreover, a small carnation-coloured spider of 
large ideas has undertaken to weave my head fast to a neighbouring 
sapling, and evidently considers me his by right of treasure-trove. 
A thousand innocent insects take an interest in me, till I begin to 
think T am fallen, like Gulliver, upon a new Land of Lilliput. And, 
truth to tell, this borderland of the Australian bush is fairyland 
enough, with its • weird beauty and peace, its forest music and 
silences, and wonderful colours, and multitudes of busy little 
creatures in earth and air and waters. 

Here, are we not far enough from cities to forget their din and

YARBAWONGA : ON THE MURE AY. 159 

smoke ? A little town, however, stands not far away in the wheat- 
fields of the plain, to remind us of the presence of man, but not near 
enough to destroy our day-dreams ; you can see the pale blue roofs 
of galvanised iron nestling into yonder fringe of red-gums in the 
soft haze, a mile or so southward. How homely and beautiful in 
the illusion of distance ! Who could dream of how many vulgar 
taverns and ribald gossips and police-court cases that peaceful-looking 
little hamlet can bring forth ? Nor shall I reveal aught. To-day, one 
would fain look at that life from its rosier side. Perchance this 
afternoon, or in the twilight, a few figures will be seen in pairs 
emerging from the haze-veiled borders ; black-clothed swains, and 
their sweethearts in light summery muslins decked with pink 
Sunday bows ; and they will go loitering and cosseting and kissing 
in the shadows by the river, these rustic lovers, and think they are 
the first who have ever been so wicked and happy in the world. 
And long may the simpletons abide in their belief ! 

And the great river flows by, winding among the gum-swamps 
and the high marigold and ochre banks of clay, on its way to the 
sea. All things around it, forest and plains and sky, are rapt away 
in that great idyllic dream of Nature that they knew along with 
the emu and the flute-bird, ages ago, before the white man had come 
to them across the Big Water. 

Through these dreamy woods great flocks of cherubim-like 
cockatoos fly in radiant circles among the luminous finery of the 
gum-tree tops, shining snow-white and yellow against the sky. 
Their sentinels have caught sight of me, and have shrilled the 
warning that a stranger is within view, and now the others fill the 
air with shrieks of protestation, anger, and alarm. Hitherto they 
had been silently tearing the bark off&quot; the dead timber, searching for 
the soft pink grubs, as silently as they had stripped farmer Jackson&apos;s 
corn for him last harvest. Now the trees are echoing like mountain 
caves with their raucous voices, and the forest becomes resonant as 
a bell. The magpies, too, take up the alarm, and a bevy of parsonic- 
looking crows, who have been pecking the body of a dead sheep, 
join in the chorus. 



160 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

In the distant lagoons, a troop of snow-white cranes look up in 
affright from their microscopic toil among the white water-lilies, and 
gather and stand, like a row of surpliced choristers, on an old log, 
and finally go flurrying away in alarm over the russet-flowered sedge 
to hunt for frogs and fish in more secluded haunts. Gradually the 
cockatoos cease their screaming, and the gum-swamp resumes its 
eternal quiet — broken only by the antique sounds which make the 
forest silence so strange and wonderful. Tap I — Tap ! You hear 
the bill of the spotted woodpecker, and little chips and flecks of bark 
fall rustling down the trunk ; in the depths of echoing trees far away 
some bird is calling, calling ; and from yonder branches comes the 
sweet, roguish fluting of a magpie ; and anon the twitterings of 
parrakeets and the wailing notes of the summer-birds are heard. 

Afar off in the swamp you hear the tinkling of a bell, which 
betrays the presence of Bill Rafferty&apos;s bullock &quot; Strawberry &quot; — 
affectionately addressed by his owner in forms of rhetoric unknown 
to Quintilian. Strawberry is at present out with the rest of the team 
for a fortnight&apos;s holiday in the gum-swamp, and as he pokes his 
nose among the flags and rushes each movement is accompanied by 
the wonderful fairy music of his bell. Unseen in the midst of the 
thickets, one might imagine that the tired and stolid old waggon- 
bullock, which has been sworn at and flogged these last ten years 
over all the roads of Riverina, and plagued by labour, dust, flies, 
and heat till his spirit is broken and fled for ever — one might 
imagine, I say, that this broken-down old beast were some wood-faun 
pursued with forest music ; some forest Ariel, with his invisible 
minstrelsy ; or might it not be that celebrated lady of nursery 
enchantment who has 

Rinf^s on her fingers and bells on her toes, 
And sweetest of music wherever she goes. 

Did you not see that sapphire-and-crimson sprite that flitted 
by on the river like a flash ? It was the little kingfisher, first cousin 
to the Momus of the woods, the laughing-jackass. Here in the clay- 
bank is the kingfisher&apos;s little nest, and there is the branch over the 




YARRAWONGA : ON THE MURRAY. 161 

stream where he sits in the shadow and sees the bright waters pass 
beneath him in the mid-day. 

And if you go round that next curve of the river some evening 
in the twilight, very silently, the brown crane that sits in the red- 
gum over the water may invite you to share his choice supper of 
river mussels, served up upon yon mud bank, and you may eat 
them out of their own dainty shells of mother-of-pearl, enamelled 
and polished in Nature&apos;s most marvellous workshop, where the 
colours were learnt from the clouds and waters at day dawn. With 
royal prodigality, my lord the Brown Crane leaves these jewelled 
and opaline dishes uncared-for after once using them, and they 
shall glitter and shine in every morning sun till next Winter come 
with his floods to bury them in the muddy river-deeps again. But 
the Brown Crane cares not, and haunts the river shallows still with 
majestic ease and dignity. 

And, as if by contrast to his sedateness. Nature has created a 
certain little blue-black fantail, a sweet-voiced, dainty little fairy 
which sings in the woods and around the settlers&apos; huts till long after 
sundown. Its movements are all bows and flirtings and pirouettes. 
Its whole life is one courtly minuet ; it cannot be sedate or thought- 
ful a moment, but poses and flirts and is for ever sprightly, timid, 
and gay like some roguish maid, or some elf out of the &quot; Midsummer 
Night&apos;s Dream.&quot; I have a hundred times desired to ask it for news 
of Cobweb and Mustard Seed, or of the Queen Titania, but have 
been called back from such fantasy by a rude, hilarious shout over- 
head among the gum-trees. 

It is the laughing-jackass — the goburra. A rare realist, is 
Jack, and plays havoc with the moods poetical and sentimental. A 
worse Philistine than Aretino ! Hard to believe that he and his 
« mates are not laughing at me. The deuce ! can they know of that 
old love-letter I kissed the other night as I was putting on my 
nightcap ? Or of those belated sapphics I tried to cobble to the 
moon — or of my despair at finding no rhyme for Boomanoomanah ? 
Or do they know of more serious things ? Egad, I distrust these 
birds ! Early of a morning, before the faint white of dawn appears

in the sky over the eastern swamps, the river-banks resound with 
their mad laughter. &quot; Some people calls &apos;im the &apos; larj&amp;n&apos;-jackass,&apos; 
but I calls him the mornin&apos;-watch,&quot; says my friend, Pete the fisher- 
man, who has been a soldier in his time. &quot; A reg&apos;lar regimental 
bugler he is, and it &apos;s my belief as that there cuss of a bird takes a 
mortal delight in rousin&apos; the whole lot of other birds out of their 
sleep, — just like my old woman, for the matter he — the bag is n&apos;t heavy,&quot; Jock answered, as he 
hurried away. 

So Jock lived in the hut that used to be Strawberry&apos;s, and 
cooked his own meals again, and muttered, and stirred the fire just 
as in years gone by. And when about a month had gone a swagman 
passed towards the setting sun, and Jock knew that Strawberry, 
too, was alone. 



172 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Then began a struggle. Should he go back to her ? Should he 
claim his own hut ? The dogs did not know ; and while he was still 
pondering, and wearing himself to a skeleton, came a day when the 
sheep were not liberated. Another followed, and by noon Straw- 
berry took his place. She let the hungry animals out and sought 
the shepherd by the creek. He was sick — was very sick. And she 
set to work to nurse him back to health. All day she watched his 
sheep, at night she yarded them, and came to sit beside the bed ; and, 
while he lay thus unconscious in summer heat, a fire broke out. At 
sundown it seemed far away, but the north wind rose and urged it 
on, and by midnight the sky was red for miles, and the woman could 
hear the crackling grass and leaves. She thought of the penned-up 
sheep, and, single-handed, burned a strip around the yard. Then, 
with set face, she hurried back to the hut and stood on guard. And 
later, when the Dogwood people came, they saw against the broad 
front of the fire the solitary figure of a woman fighting as never 
woman fought before. So she worked and watched till Jock got 
well again, and together they went back to his hut. There she 
made a garden and planted fruit-trees ; she helped him with the 
flock ; she saved money. They even enlarged the hut in the course 
of years ; and when sickness came again it was Jock who bore the 
burden of the toil and the watching ; and he it was who was left 
to mourn. 

He came home one day and found their visitor of years before 
waiting, his brows even more shaggy, his skin even darker. 

&quot; Gone ? &quot; the fellow asked laconically, pointing to the closed 
door. 

&quot; Dead ! &quot; Jock answered simply. 

The stranger started. &quot; No ! . . . She was my wife,&quot; he said 
quickly. 

&quot; The grave-stone says Missus J. Condon,&quot; was the response ; 
and there was a touch of pride in the old man&apos;s voice, 

J. J. POYNTON. 



THE PATIENT&apos;S HAND-BELL 

DR. LAWTON sat down to his dinner in a distinctly irritable 
frame of mind. He had only just come to Hospital 

as house-surgeon ; and, in the midst of the hundred and one 
worries of settling down, he had by no means appreciated finishing 
a long day&apos;s work by having to dance attendance on a particularly 
fussy &quot; honorary &quot; as the latter made his rounds. Now he expended 
some of his accumulated vexation in a vicious thump on the knob of 
the hand-bell which stood within reach of his right hand. Un- 
fortunately he did not derive the relief he expected, for the thing 
refused to ring, an additional grievance which resulted in the use of 
vigorous expletives. Luckily these were cut short by the entrance 
of the ward-maid bringing his dinner, and the meal began to work 
its due efiiect on the hungry animal. 

Before long the house-surgeon had suflSciently recovered to take 
his usual amicable view of the world at large, and when the bell 
which had so firmly resisted his efforts obligingly rang of its own 
accord, he only looked amusedly surprised. Taking it up he 
examined it carefully. It was a slightly concave disc of brass on 
a stand ; but he could neither move the knob at the top, nor the 
hammer underneath. 

As he turned it slowly round a knock came to the door, and the 
matron entered. 

&quot; This is a nice useful sort of bell you &apos;ve given me, Mrs. Boyce ; 
you evidently don&apos;t mean me to become a nuisance by ringing it too 
often.&quot; 

The house-surgeon, in that beneficence of mood produced by 
the happy combination of a good dinner and an excellent digestion, 
spoke quite genially, and he was utterly surprised at the effect of 

173 . 



174 ^^^ BULLETIN STOBY BOOK. 

his speech. The matron, a pleasant-looking, middle-aged woman, 
turned a chalky-white ; then she flashed a glance at the ward-maid, 
who, with a frightened look on her face, was clearing the table, her 
trembling fingers jingling the glasses and china. 

There was a little pause. Then the matron spoke quietly, but 
rather hoarsely. 

&quot; Did you find it hard to ring, doctor ? All you have to do is 
to press the centre of the knob firmly. It is rather stiff,&quot; — and she 
showed a small hollow in the knob. 

&quot; It &apos;s rather a complicated dodge for such a simple thing,&quot; was 
the doctor&apos;s comment ; &quot; only don&apos;t blame me if you have the trouble 
of coming for nothing ; it seems to have a little way of ringing all 
by itself,&quot; — and Dr. Lawton put the bell on the mantelpiece as he 
prepared to follow the matron out of the room. 

Amongst the private hobbies which Dr. Lawton rode with 
enthusiasm was the study of hypnotism. He possessed a certain 
degree of clairvoyance, and that and kindred subjects were of the 
keenest interest to him. His position at the hospital, while 
affording him ample experience, gave him plenty of time to pursue 
such studies. 

One evening, a month or so after coming to the hospital, he was 
sprawling comfortably on his big, leather-covered sofa, enjoying a 
final pipe before turning in. He was ruminating in a lazy sort of 
way on various phases of his favourite subject ; an extreme quietude 
pervaded the room, broken only by the striking of his erratic hand- 
bell. He was used by this time to its vagaries, which he put down 
to the fickleness of feminine gimcracks ; and now, as it disturbed 
the silence, it only served to recall, in his semi-comatose condition, 
the fact that everyone connected with the hospital, whether matron, 
nurses, ward-maids, or porter, was obviously and undeniably scared 
at its ring. And ... 

The heavy smell of sleep hung over the long hospital ward, 
saturated though it was with the odours of iodoform and carbolic 
acid. The rows of beds veiled in mosquito nets, ranged against 




THE PATIENT&apos;S HANDBELL. 175 

each wall, looked like ghostly catafalques, shrouding unreal forms 
made grotesque in the dim light by reason of the cradles and other 
surgical appliances. The figure of the night nurse, as she moved 
with soft deliberation from bed to bed, cast quaint shadows on the 
spotless floor. Now and then a patient moaned, hardly disturbing 
the quietude of the ward, and occasionally the tinkle of a bell called 
the nurse&apos;s attention. Nearly always this sound came from the bed 
at the farther end of a ward, and again and again the nurse went 
to the bed, shook up the pillows, smoothed the covering, and tried 
to soothe the querulous complaints of her patient. 

She had done this for perhaps the twentieth time, when the 
matron appeared at the entrance to the ward. For a moment or 
two they stood in convei*sation. Presently the matron walked down 
the room, stopping to take some small object from the long table. 
Then she passed on to the bed where the wakeful patient lay feebly 
tinkling his bell. She, too, tried to soothe his restless complaints ; 
but, seeing he was not in a condition to be reasoned with, she put 
the bell she carried in place of the one beside him, and turned 
away. 

For a little while the man lay still, his emaciated features 
working with discontent. Presently, with a huge effort, making 
every joint in the bedstead creak and rattle, he rolled round, panting 
with the exertion, starting the perspiration in large drops on his 
forehead. With a gesture of peevish determination he stretched 
out his hand for the bell. Half puzzled, half annoyed, he was 
quick to detect the change. Instead of the handle which he had 
only to lift and shake, his hand covered an unfamiliar brass disc. 
An angry glitter came into the glassy eye as he half lifted, half 
dragged the bell from the locker to the bed. Resting for a few 
minutes after the exertion, he felt the bell all over with his long, 
thin fingers, unable to sound it. A purple flush came into his face 
as he raised himself up to examine it in the dim light, then, with a 
gurgling gasp, he fell back on his pillows. His jaws gaped, the bell 
dropped from his nerveless hand and rolled upon the floor, and the 
feeble, flickering life went out . . . 



176 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

It seemed to the house-surgeon that he was not more awake 
now, lying on his comfortable sofa, than he had been a few 
minutes before, when he so clearly saw the struggles of the dying 
man to ring his hand-bell. 

There it stood on the table near him. Just then the hammer 
struck against the brass disc. The matron, entering the room, 
heard it, the usual scared look coming into her face at its sound. 
She had come to ask for a prescription the doctor had promised 
her, but she had hard work to steady her voice to make the 
request. Dr. Lawton went to the writing-table and wrote for a 
minute. Rising, he crossed to the matron, and spoke : 

&quot; Mrs. Boyce, can you tell me how this dent was made in the 
sideof my belU&quot; 

He was a resolute man, and, as he spoke, his voice sounded 
harshly, almost intimidatingly, in the woman&apos;s ear. She made no 
answer, and for a moment he stood looking compellingly into her 
eyes. 

&quot; It was given,&quot; he went on, &quot; to a patient in No. 3 ward, and 
in his death-struggle it rolled on the floor.&quot; 

A long, gasping shudder ran through the woman&apos;s frame. She 
threw up her hands as if to shield herself. 

&quot; Sir,&quot; she said brokenly, &quot; it was not our fault ; we did not 
know. We had no idea he was so ill ; the doctors even did not 
think he was in danger. It was hard to ring, and we often gave it to 
troublesome patients. They were just as pleased as long as they 
had a bell of some sort, and he was an extra troublesome one — just 
the wreck of a man, brought in to end his days in the hospital. He 
seemed likely to linger on for weeks ; failure of the heart&apos;s action, 
the doctor said it was ; but as there is a God above I hope and pray 
that worrying over that bell did not hasten the end. Sir, it has 
driven us almost demented. Put it where we would it rang, till it 
frightened the senses out of the patients and nurses. When you 
asked for a bell, I thought surely you had done no harm, and here 
it might be quiet,&quot; — and the woman broke down, sobbing like one at 
last relieved of a burden too heavy to be borne. 



THE PATIENT&apos;S HANDBELL, 177 

The next day, a typical Sydney summer day, a half-decked 
sailing boat was scudding down the harbour. In it were two 
persons. Dr. Lawton and the man who owned the boat. There was 
a fairly calm sea, and they turned between the Heads, and out into 
the ocean. There Dr. Lawton took a small and heavy packet from 
his coat pocket, and, going forward, quietly dropped it over the 
bows. Had he been asked, he would hardly have cared to state his 
reason ; still less could he account for his very genuine feeling of 
relief as they put about.

THE CORRESPONDENCE OF A LITTLE 
DRESSMAKER. 

I. — His Lettbb. 

NOT being used to letter-writing, I do not know how I ought 
to begin this. Ought I to call you Miss or Bess ? One is 
too high-faluting, and the other is too familiar-like for me, 
and we have not seen each other for a good while, although we 
began to go to work at the same time. Why, now, how long is it 
since you used to do my sums for me when I could not manage my 
home-lessons ? I mind my old father saying that a letter should 
always be like a bill, the items put down all spick and span, and 
nothing in it that is not needed any more than a real business bill 
would have ; but the truth of the matter is I don&apos;t know how to 
say what I want to say, but I suppose there&apos;s nothing for it but to 
put my hand to the helm and steer straight to the point I want to 
reach. I &apos;m one of those chaps who never get wild over anything 
one w$y or the other They say that &apos;s what makes such a good 
skipper of me. I can always see what is the right thing to do in 
any sort of weather. I am not saying this to blow my own trumpet, 
because it comes to me to do the right thing. It is n&apos;t my fault. 
The ketch is my own, and it did not take all of my savings to build 
her either, the beauty. These are the items. The total is — will 
you have me for a husband ? There, I have got it out at last. You 
could live in one of the river towns. The thing is you might be 
lonely while I am away on the Bess. Yes, that &apos;s what I &apos;ve called 
her I can&apos;t alter the name now, whatever your answer is, because 
everybody knows her by it. I must not persuade, because if you 
remember me well enough to like me you will come anyhow, and if 

178 



THE CORRESPONDENCE OF A LITTLE DRESSMAKER. 179 

you do not I hope you will not come just to please me. I do not 
suppose that you will decide all of a sudden, so I will call at the 
address written on a slip of paper with this in a month&apos;s time. God 
(if He is the chap who looks after things) — God bless you. 

Yours, if you like the ownership, 

John Baxton. 

P.S. — The ketch is painted green with trimmings of white. I 
asked an artist chap what colours to have. I remembered that you 
did not like a red hat and green jacket that sat opposite to us once 
on the ferry-boat. I had my own cabin-door in red, because it is 
the colour of colours for me. It &apos;s the colour of the gums in the 
spring. 

P.S. — Another item I forgot, a bit of land on the river. The 
trees are all left. Once you said that houses ought to grow like the 
trees do. Well, mine has been growing for a good many years in a 
very small allotment. I hope you won&apos;t think in my own head, but, 
by Jove, perhaps you are tired of reading this by now and having a 
good laugh at me. I can&apos;t help that. I never could help laughing 
at funny things myself. 

P.S. — The flannel-flowers are growing on the bit of land. 



II. — Thb Lbttbr She Sent. 

Dear Mr. Baxton, — 

I have never had so hard a task as this of answering your 
letter. You have honoured me by asking me to marry you. You 
take a great deal on trust, because you have only memories of me as 
a child. I have no particular memories of you ; in fact, have never 
thought of you at all. Do not think this is hard or unkind, but I 
am sure from the manly tone of your letter that you would rather 
have the truth than anything else. You remember things I thought 
and said, and I only remember you as a rough-haired boy who was 



180 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

fond of laughing. Thanking you and apologising for anything that 
may seem hard in my letter, 

I am, yours very sincerely, 

Bess Burns. 

III. — The Letter She Didn&apos;t Send. 

My Dearest Old Skipper, — 

Your dear letter came like a breath from the sea that you 
love so well. I remembered very little about John Baxton, but I 
know the skipper who wrote my letter. Where it is at the present 
moment I am not going to tell you. But I will tell you that I know 
it off by heart and say it for my grace while the children are 
pattering their &quot;We thank Thee, O Lord.&quot; Not that I do not 
thank Him too. I have so much to thank Him for since the fifth 
of a very wintry month, this year, but my heart is beating thanks 
all the time. You said, &quot; If He is the chap that looks after things,&quot; 
as though you doubted His existence. Why, my would-be sceptic, 
who do you think makes people so glad sometimes, if everything is 
left to chance ? But I do not care what you say about it, because 
I know that, if anyone were in trouble, they would not hesitate to 
go to Skipper Baxton. 

Your wife ? I have only one objection. You would get to 
know me so well that you would not go to your imagination for my 
good qualities any more, and I should not go to the same source for 
my romantic visions of you, either. I should dearly like to sail with 
you in the Bess some of the time Fancy the wife of a skipper who 
does not know what it feels like to be on the ocean ! Once I was 
in a sailing-boat, in the harbour, down past Bradley&apos;s Head, and we 
nearly capsized, but it is one of the most splendid recollections I 
have in my poor brain that will only hold needles, scissors, and 
paper patterns. The wind sang in the rigging, the sails cried out at 
the strain, and the waves leapt up and tossed the spray in our faces 
until the boys were compelled to furl the sail and put up the 
spinnaker instead And when we were safely round the head and

in Middle Harbour I felt as though I had had a glimpse of an awful 
but wondrous life. There, that is all I know of the sea as far as 
being on it goes. The ferry-boats don&apos;t count, because they are 
very tame compared with the sailer. I have never been since. 
Mother was so frightened that she made me promise not to go any 
more. 

That much was written on Sunday in church. Now I am 
waiting for a customer to come and have her dress fitted. It is four 
o&apos;clock, Saturday afternoon. I am very glad that we makers have n&apos;t 
to marry women, because the wives would have to make their 
husbands&apos; dresses. You don&apos;t think I am going to mend your 
clothes, do you ? Because I am going to drown all needles in the 
Pacific, and then spend all my days on the bit of land. A house ? 
No, you need n&apos;t think of a house. When a house is built, a broom 
finds its way into the kitchen, and when a woman has hands the 
broom finds its way into them and they sweep. There &apos;s a knock. 
My customer. I must finish my dissertation on sweeping another 
time. 

If you will promise to keep an automatic machine for 
sweeping I will not finish my article on the matter, because the rain 
during the last few days has reminded me that it would not be very 
pleasant camping in the grounds without a house. I am afraid the 
flannel-flowers could not hold enough water to keep us dry. 

What was it you said about a red hat and a green jacket ? 
Have I been a fashionable dressmaker all these years for nothing ? 
Don&apos;t you know that green and purple, and green and red, and 
green and blue and everything, are fashionable and artistic ! When 
you see me you will know me by the variety of colours I wear. 
Green hat, blue dress, scarlet necktie, violet sash spotted with pink 
daisies, and blue roses in my belt. Do you know about the blue 
roses ? Perhaps you have not read &quot; The Light that Failed.&quot; One 
chapter begins &quot; Roses red and roses white sought I for my love&apos;s 
delight. She would none of all my roses, bade me gather her blue 
posies Half the world I wandered through, seeking where such 
flowers grew. Half the world unto my quest answered but with 



182 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

laugh and jest. Oh, &apos;t was but an idle quest. Roses red and white 
are best.&quot; But I am not a visionary, as this might lead you to 
think ; and I can mend torn clothes. So you need n&apos;t wonder if all 
my nonsense is nonsense, or if it is real, because — well, what do you 
think it is ? I do not like brooms. 

Would you, could you, bring your ketch into the harbour at 
a given time ? — and I would be at South Head (in all my colours) to 
welcome her and — her skipper. I wonder what you are like. This 
is my impression from your occupation : short, thick-set and sturdy 
when off duty, but nimble as a rabbit when a Sou&apos;-Easter blows you 
towards the rocks and you want to give them a wide berth. You 
are to admire my sailor-like talk because I have been reading Clark 
Russell and the Boys&apos; Own to collect some nautical terms. Please 
answer these questions in your next letter, which is to come on the 
wings of the wind, not by the postman, though he is forgiven for all 
his old tricks now, since — but never mind the date. Question 1. 
The gunwale is the piece of wood that goes out from the back of the 
boat in a slanting direction, is it not ? Question 2. Is the bumpkin 
the little fence round the boat to keep the skipper from falling out ? 
And, Question 3. I know the stays are the bulk of the boat, the part 
under the water, so you need n&apos;t answer that question. If these are 
mistakes you are to understand that they are intended for jokes, but 
if they are right they are not intended that way. Ask me questions 
about the different parts of a boat, because I asked a man who 
knows all about it, yet there was a strange twinkle in his eyes when 
he told me some of the things. I wonder if he was amusing himself. 
But you will tell me There is only one thing better than writing 
to you, and that is seeing you. Am I always to wait for the 
contrary winds to move along ? Can&apos;t they be regulated ? Ah, it 
seems so wonderful to me how you sailors can manage to bring the 
vessels safe and sound into port when contrary winds spring up. I 
would never do for a skipper. I can&apos;t fight contrary forces. I turn 
back and go with the wind. I have only seen the vessels at anchor 
in the harbour, and one gets so accustomed to seeing them stolid 
and still that it is hard to imagine them alive and full of effort. I 



THE CORRESPONDENCE OF A LITTLE DRESSMAKER. 183 

wonder, when you are away on the Pacific and the winds spring up, 

if I shall be frightened ? I don&apos;t think so. I shall be sure that the 

wind never blew and the sea never roared that you could not 

conquer — and, after all, you are not going to see this. I am just 

scribbling a fancy letter for recreation. 

Good-bye, from 

Your Bess. 

P.S. — I went to the bush to see if the gums have red leaves, 
and they have. The spring is late this year. Next spring 

NOTE. 

In one of her rare lapses into carelessness the Little Dressmaker 
must have placed this scribbling-book among some others that were 
to be given to the Mother for putting into the cake-tins when the 
cakes were made. And as Mother was tearing the leaves out to put 
in the tins her eye caught the word &quot;Skipper,&quot; and she read the 
rest of the page, and, becoming deeply interested, looked for the 
others and read them all. And when the cooking was finished, this 
little Mother sat down to the table with paper and pen — a most 
unusual thing, because Bess always wrote her letters and addressed 
everything that went through the post. But this letter was written 
by the Mother, addressed, and taken to the post-office, and nothing 
was said to anyone, and — anyway, there was no more Correspondence.

A MARTYR OF NO ACCOUNT. 

THE sun looked down unwinkingly upon the rolling sand-dunes 
covered with a scrabbly undergrowth of mallee, ti-tree and 
lianas. It looked searchingly and pitilessly down upon the 
rubble hut with its flat tin-roof and &quot; hessian &quot; substitutes for 
windows. The everlastings stiffened and curled in the fierce heat, 
and the earth sizzled and fumed. The sweat from the doctor&apos;s 
horse quivered into the baked atmosphere and left streaks of acrid 
salt ruled down his heaving sides. No bird called. No insect 
hummed. The flies were clinging to the shady sides of the limestone 
boulders, and Sheol was in the air. 

Inside the hotel all was as dark as a cellar, and as close. There 
was the same stillness, save for the heavy breathing of the man and 
the woman and the children — all lying in one bed smitten by the 
influenza-devil. The atmosphere of the place was poison — fetid, 
stagnant, and charged with every foul human product. Only one 
person besides the doctor moved in the den, slowly and with a 
mechanical languor. She was a girl of nineteen or twenty, who 
might have been good to look upon but for neglect and uncleanliness 
and the advance signals of disease. Now and then the man 
ground his teeth and groaned voicelessly. The woman whined an 
occasional answer to a question from the doctor. Ajid the children 
slept the sleep of ptomaines and carbonic acid gas. The girl stood 
listlessly at the foot of the iron bed, supporting herself, with both 
lean, horny hands clutching its rusty rail. 

&quot; How long have you been down ? &quot; asked the doctor of the 
woman. 

&quot; A week,&quot; she complained ; &quot; and he has been in bed four 
days ; them &quot; (indicating the children) &quot;all took bad ten days ago.&quot;^ 

184 



A MARTYR OF NO ACCOUNT. X85 

The doctor said little, but took temperatures, auscultated 
chests, and made entries in his note-book. It was a monotonous 
proceeding, broken only when he went out for a pannikin of warm 
water from the galvanised tank to wash his thermometer. The man 
had the headache ; little else of importance. The woman had the 
cough : the cough that is like the rending of the soul from the body ; 
but, again, little else of importance. The children had the deadly, 
helpless, hopeless sleep, from which they only awoke at intervals to 
moan and toss and complain and go to sleep again. 

Just then the man roused himself to whimper for &quot; some- 
thing for this &apos;ere pain in my *ead. It&apos;s driving me mad.&quot; The 
woman would &quot;never live through another night if I don&apos;t 
get relief from this corf.&quot; The children made no complaint. They 
slept and breathed ptomaines and carbonic dioxide. And the girl 
said nothing, but gazed at the doctor with a hazy, half-intelligent 
stare and gripped the iron bed-rail harder, while her breath came and 
went in quick, irregular gasps and her nostrils moved like those of 
a winded hare. 

&quot; Anyone to fetch out the medicine ? &quot; Perhaps a neighbour 
would if the doctor would ask. Brandy ? Yes. A little chicken- 
broth ? Yes ; Violet Pearl would make that. 

&quot; Violet Pearl ! go and git Jimmy a drink ! Can&apos;t yer &apos;ear &apos;im 
movin&apos; ? &quot; whined the woman in a grieved tone ; and then : &quot; The 
girl is that stoopid and mazy-like, she ain&apos;t the leastest good to 
nobody. As if it was n&apos;t bad enough to be nigh onto death without 
&apos;avin&apos; to worrit for everything as is wanted ! &quot; 

As the girl returned, stumbling over the uneven limestone 
floor, her father broke out : &quot; For Gawd&apos;s sake, Violet Pearl, &apos;ow 
much longer are you goin&apos; to let this &apos;an&apos;kerchief dry on my &apos;ead? 
Were &apos;s the vinegar and water ? Wring it out agin, carn&apos;t yer ! &quot; 

&quot; Sit down,&quot; said the doctor to her, a moment later ; &quot; let me 
have a look at your chest.&quot; Listlessly she unfastened the dowdy 
calico bodice and bared her thin neck and shoulders, breathing a 
little harder, but not appearing much interested. 

&quot; Hm ! &quot; said the doctor, as he moved the end of the stethoscope 



186 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

here and there, and tapped with his finger-ends on her all too plainly 
visible ribs; and then, a little later, &quot;Temperature 104°, pulse 120, 
left posterior base solid,&quot; he wrote in his note-book, — and to the girl 
he added, &quot; You must go to bed, and stop there ! If you don&apos;t do 
BO now, you &apos;11 have to to-morrow, and then you may not get out of 
it again.&quot; 

A chorus came from the man and woman, &quot; Lord sakes ! doctor, 
w&apos;at are yer talkin&apos; about ? &apos;oo &apos;s to look arfter us ? She &apos;s the only 
one as is fit to move ; as for me &quot; (the woman continued alone), &quot;/ 
could n&apos;t get up and do nothink, not if — if — you was to pay me ! an&apos; 
I &apos;ra sure he could n&apos;t do nothink if he was to get up.&quot; The 
man groaned, and said his head would come off if he were to move, 
and it was all nonsense talking of Violet Pearl &quot;laying up.&quot; She 
was &quot;always fancying she had something the matter with her.&quot; 

The doctor sighed, and explained again, and at last lost his 
temper. &quot; You good-for-nothing brute ! &quot; he said, looking con- 
temptuously at the man. &quot;What the devil does your headache 
matter compared with this girl&apos;s chances of dying in forty-eight 
hours if she does n&apos;t go to bed ? She &apos;s fifty times worse than your 
wife here ; and, as for you, you &apos;re in no danger at all ! &quot; 

Then he was sorry he had lost his temper, because it was of no 
use. The man groaned and the woman whined, and the children 
slept, and Yiolet Pearl smiled feebly and breathed a little faster, 
and said she could get along all right till Aunt Emma came ; Aunt 
Emma had promised to come the day after to-morrow. No one else 
would come, because they were frightened of &quot; catching it their- 
selves.&quot; And again the doctor sighed, and then swore silently and 
rode away to arrange with a neighbour to take medicine to them. 

Two days later he went again. The same baking heat ; the 
same white, glaring light from the sand beating on the frowsy 
&quot; hessian &quot; and &quot; sujee &quot; windows ; and, inside, the same fetid and 
plague-stricken atmosphere, and a silence this time broken by a few 
large, yellow-bodied droning flies that boomed and buzzed about the 
room. 

The man was sitting up near the fireplace. The woman 



A MARTYR OF NO ACCOUNT. 187 

whimpered in a corner, seated on a kerosene-box. The children 
slept on a &quot; shake-down &quot; of gunny-sacks in another corner. And 
on the iron bed, covered by a coarse and dingy sheet, which fell 
into hollows and stood starkly out in horrible, unmistakeable ridges, 
lay something that had been Violet Pearl. 

She had &quot;got along all right&quot; until that morning. Then the 
poor, willing, helpful spirit had shaken itself free and left its 
partner, and the man with the headache and the woman with a 
cough had unwillingly got up to attend to their wants themselves.

NICK YEDDER&apos;S GOLD. 

OLD Nick Vedder trudged manfully down the cliff-track to 
Strahan, picking his steps as one who had travelled far and 
whose pack was heavy. 

Morris, seeing him in the distance, awoke from day dreams 
into a sudden interest. &quot;Here comes old man Vedder again,&quot; he 
said to a companion who sat in the doorway of the Cornucopia 
Hotel, gazing seaward. But the latter, after turning a pair of blood- 
shot eyes in the direction of the new-comer, looked out again 
between the points of the bay and said nothing. 

&quot; If I could only track him down &quot; began Morris. 

&quot; Bah ! &quot; impatiently said the other, who was called Maori 
Jack, &quot; it &apos;s always the same cry. Never a soft-headed old hatter 
can come down from the ranges for tucker but you Strahan loafers 
must have it that his swag &apos;s full of nuggets. There &apos;s not an ounce 
of gold in the whole coast, I tell you.&quot; 

&quot;But he must be on to a good patch somewhere,&quot; insisted 
Morris. &quot; It was all a plant, him showing us those pyrites specimens 
and pretending to believe they were the genuine. He &apos;s not the 
luny you think, I &apos;11 swear that. It &apos;s all a game to hide that he &apos;s 
on good gold, and it &apos;s a game I &apos;m going to take a hand in before 
long.&quot; 

But the other, with fine inconsequence, remarked that they &apos;d 
have a bit of wind behind them this trip, and had better be going 
before it died. That it would take them two hours good to get 
across the harbour, anyway, and old Yedolph had got to have his 
keg that night whatever happened. — And for the traders in illicit 
spirits, old Yedolph, proprietor of the Cornucopia Hotel, Strahan, 

a person whose wishes were not lightly to be disregarded.

NICK VEDDER&apos;S GOLD. 189 

Morris, dozing in the bottom of the boat, heard rough steps on 
the shingle, and, looking up, with the blink of the slanting sun in 
his eyes, saw Maori Jack and Lang, called &quot; the Butcher,&quot; running 
across the foreshore to where the boat lay beached. On their heels 
followed Christian, one of the two local policemen ; and the other 
was panting lamentably in the rear as he jogged through the pig- 
face scrub. Morris pushed the boat clear of the beach, and stood 
waiting, ready to pole-off. Maori Jack and Lang were over the 
thwarts in an instant, but as the boat swung clear Christian grasped 
the oar with which the boat was being levered out into the tide- 
way. &quot; Stop, Morris ! &quot; he began, clapping hand to the pistol in 
his belt. He did not finish the sentence, for Morris struck at him 
with the heavy end of a broken oar, so that he fell face downwards 
in the seaweed. 

A gust of wind filled the jib, and the boat edged free of the 
kelpage out of the lee of the sloping cliffs. But Maori Jack, with a 
pointing forefinger to the red stain that followed in its wake, said, 
&quot; My God, you &apos;ve killed him ! I heard his skull crack,&quot; — and sat 
down on the bottom of the boat, moaning. 

&quot;Haul in that mainsheet, can&apos;t you?&quot; answered Morris, 

savagely, &quot; or we &apos;11 have that riddling us with shot-holes ! &quot; — 

and he cried out derisively to the other constable, who, after firing a 
couple of ineffective shots, bent over the motionless figure that lay 
with the water lapping over it in little waves. 

And then, looking over at Maori Jack, still crouched in the 
stern with his gaze bent to the white trail that followed the 
keel : &quot; You cowards ! &quot; Morris said, in sudden rage ; &quot; you &apos;11 swing 
for this as well as me ! &quot; — answering the horror that spoke in the 
others&apos; eyes. 

The boat slowly made way across to where the shadow of 
Heemskirk lay on Strahan, and the harbour spread behind them a 
plate of silver rippled with leaden lines that seared its surface 
ever and again. 

&quot; They caught us with the kegs comin&apos; up the gully,&quot; said the 
Butcher, thickly; &quot;me an&apos; Maori; an&apos; Christian fired at us, an&apos; 



190 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

we run for the boat, did n&apos;t we, Maori ? &quot; But Maori Jack, speaking 
for the first time since they had left the beach, cried out, &quot; My God ! 
look there ! &quot; — still pointing astern. There was a white spot over 
against Dead Island, silhouetted on the dark background of the 
squall that was heading towards them across the harbour. The 
police-boat was already on its way to Strahan with the news. 

The moon had risen in a ghastly redness when they beached 
their boat near the mouth of Stockyard Creek, hiding her carefully 
in the dense tea-tree which was rooted well out intx) the water. 

&quot;We may want her again,&quot; said Morris, &quot;if&quot; There was a 

grimness in the unfinished sentence that sent the Butcher off 
into a nervous chuckle. 

They got swags and tucker at Lang&apos;s hut, and then, crossing 
the button-grass, were lost in the dark shadows that canopied the 
track. A couple of miles out they cut the Hobart wire just five 
minutes after a message had passed along that barred every port in 
Tasmania to them, and sent half-a-dozen mounted troopers, a few 
hours later, jingling along the Linda track on their road to 
Strahan. 

The slopes of the Frenchman&apos;s Cap are honeycombed with 
caves ; and in the dense scrub that clothes the gullies running in to 
the base of the mountain, men in search of solitude might defy an 
army of seekers. The refugees could afford to laugh at the handful 
who were making ineffectual efforts to discover their whereabouts. 
And, after a space, this was realised, and the hunt was limited to a 
patrol party that moved up and down the Linda track investigating 
the little district outrages this side of Arrowsmith — all laid to the 
discredit of Morris and his gang of two. 

&quot;Worn out by exposure and scanty food, the outlaws at last had 
to abandon their stronghold and make a dash for freedom. Morris 
recognised the grim necessity when he saw the other two whispering 
apart, and read their furtive looks. There were two chances : one 
a traverse through the forest, making to come out at the Huon 




NICK VEDDER&apos;S GOLD. 191 

below Hobart ; the other, to make for the mainland by boat. Sailor 
Jack, a law-abiding scoundrel of their acquaintance, had caused 
them to be informed through one of their &quot; telegraphs &quot; that he was 
willing, for a consideration, to let them have their own boat some 
dark night at the Gordon mouth. But they had no money, and 
Sailor Jack, with unfeeling caution, insisted on a spot-cash 
transaction. &quot; By God, then, we &apos;11 risk a dash through Strahan 

and get the boat for ourselves ! &quot; said Morris at the end of a 

weary debate, cutting the knot of their difficulty. 

And so it was that one evening they came to be skulking along 
the Linda track where it takes a bend to avoid a curl of the 
Collingwood River. They had barely time to plunge into the under- 
growth that belted the track, at the sound of horses&apos; hoofs. A 
squad of troopers jingled by so closely that Morris could with ease 
have picked off any one of them with his drawn revolver ; and their 
careless talk came plainly to his ears. Another bend, and the 
troopers were gone. 

But Morris, beyond the brushwood, had seen a little spiral of 
smoke rising among the timber at the foot of the gully. The three 
of them scrambled down, and, after much reconnoitring, found in 
the dusk of the myrtles a rough-built hut. And in the doorway sat 
&quot; old man Vedder,&quot; smoking in silent contemplation, as if never a 
living thing were near beside the &quot; popjockeys &quot; whistling in the 
underbrush, and the little ring-tail &apos;possums that lived a friendly life 
in the blackwood that bent over the hut-roof. 

Out of earshot, the three discussed the situation, and came to 
the one possible decision. Yedder must have provisions and might 
have gold, a few ounces of which would enable them to purchase 
Sailor Jack&apos;s proffered co-operation. 

Maori Jack kept watch amongst the ferns on a little eminence 
outside the timber, while the others stealthily approached the hut 
from the rear. The crack of a branch over which Morris tripped in 
the gloom betrayed them, and the hut-door was hastily shut in 
their faces, but not before Lang had put a foot over the threshold. 



192 &apos; THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

With his shoulders he burst his way in, to find himself gripped in 
Vedder&apos;s thin, nervy arms. As they lay struggling on the floor, 
Morris pulled a revolver from a pouch and fired into Vedder&apos;s 
side. His grasp on Morris&apos;s throat relaxed, and he lay still, while 
a little red stream ran from under his body and followed the angles 
of the rough floor. 

Lang offered little thanks for the assistance. &quot; You fool ! &quot; he 
cried ; &quot; are you mad 1 This &apos;11 bring the traps down on us,&quot; — and he 
edged to the door, holding his shirt-sleeve to his throat where 
Vedder&apos;s nails had torn great angry lacerations. 

&quot; Fill your tucker-bag ! &quot; answered Morris, laughing wildly, and 
himself continued to ransack every corner of the room in eager 
haste, tearing down shelves and overturning boxes in wild confusion. 

There came the call of a mountain-thrush from up the gully, 
and Morris whistled back the same note. Lang made for the door 
with his swag. &quot; They &apos;ve heard that shot, damn you ! &quot; he said as 
he went. 

Morris, as a last chance, prised up the hearth-stone, saw a little 
canvas-bag, grabbed it, and rushed out after the others. At the 
crest above there were three troopers running towards them, not a 
hundred yards away. The ambuscade had been successful. 

Morris followed his mate up a cut-off, curving away from the 
track round the extreme verge of the cliff. At a bend which hid 
him for the moment from his pursuers, he seized a sapling, swung 
himself over the edge, and lay quiet as the troopers clattered by on 
foot, not noticing in the darkness the scared white face that looked 
up at them out of the bed of fan-fern on the cliff-edge. Morris 
lay motionless until in the distance two shots rang out — the 
last, the quick crack of a rifle. Then he slid down from rock to 
rock, helped by the undergrowth that hid in the fissures weather- 
worn into the smooth cliff-face, compassing such feats as would have 
tried stronger nerves than his in fair daylight. Reaching the level 
where the Broken Creek wound its way, he ran along the open 
avenue of button-grass flat at the edge of the creek till his breath 



NICK VEDDER&apos;S GOLD. 193 

failed him, and then he lay panting, with the bag of gold still inside 
the bosom of his shirt. 

He had lost his matches, and could only appraise his treasure 
roughly by weight. Light for its bulk, he thought ; but there must 
be forty or fifty ounces. Fifty ounces — two hundred pounds ! His 
breathing grew easier, and his lair smoother as he fondled and 
caressed his bundle. It was dear to him as life itself. It meant 
life itself ! Plenty of assistance to be bought with the contents of 
this little bag. He rejoiced that Lang — cursed, interfering fool — 
was dead. The silence that followed the rifle-shot meant that. Shot 
like a trapped dog, probably, about a quarter of a mile on, where 
the track &quot; blinded &quot; into the cliff. Morris laughed to himself as he 
pictured the Butcher standing with his back to the cliff up 
which he had no time to climb by the rough step-notches cut in the 
face — perhaps, if fear had made him brave, chancing the steep 
descent, and pitching from rock to rock till he lay a bundle of red 
ffesh at the foot. Morris started in alarm at the thought. If the 
Butcher had done a jump, they &apos;d follow him down ; if not now, 
then in the morning. But he quickly reassured himself. There 
would have been more rifle-shots than the one that came to him. 
No, Lang — curse him ! — was dead on the cliff above, with a carbine 
bullet in him. Good riddance ! 

Maori Jack had said that old man Vedder was mad, and never 
was on gold. Maori Jack could die, too — curse him ! — so long as he 
was safe. And then, from pure exhaustion, his brain ceased to 
work, and he slept where he lay buried in the ferns. 

In the morning he awoke and shook himself; and, with a 
sudden terror, as his memory came back to him, put hand to side to 
feel if the bag was secure. He opened it and poured out a couple 
of ounces of the contents on a plate of bark. And then, suddenly, 
as he played with his fingers among the little heap of shining yellow 
that glistened in the sun newly breaking above the Frenchman — 
with eyes dilated and a smile of content set on his features in 
ghastly petrifaction — he plunged his hand into the bag and held the 
palmful of metal to his eyes. Then, with maniacal laughter, he rose 

M 



194 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

and fled, holding tight in his hand the little canvas bag, while he 
climbed and climbed like the lost traveller whose wits have left him 
in the horror of the big bush. And ever and anon came his horrid 
laugh, growing wilder and wilder in the distance as the mountain 
sides bandied it back and forth in quaintest echo. 

The troopers wound their way back to Strahan, bearing among 
them a motionless burden on a rudely-contrived litter. One of them 
had his upper arm bound about with a bloody handkerchief. 

Sergeant Leggath, who was in advance, suddenly reined back 
his horse, and pointed dumbly to a big granite boulder alongside the 
track. 

Outlined against the dawn stood a figure familiar, although the 
clothes hung upon &apos;it in strips like the bark of a swamp myrtle. 
&quot; Stand, in the ^tniiFi name ! &quot; called the sergeant, loudly, and a 
wild laugh and a revolver-shot came in answer. A raw young 
private, who had been fingering nervously at the trigger of his 
carbine, sighted and pulled. 

Morris stood for two seconds, and then plunged heavily forward 
and lay still in the undergrowth twenty feet below, with one empty 
hand dabbling in the current of the pool that washed the base of 
the boulder. 

Down the surface of the stream floated a torn canvas-bag, to 
which there still adhered some specks of yellow, glittering pyrites.

PRODUCTS. 

1 PADDLED up the river. 
I was tired of civilisation and its products, so I turned my 

back upon the city and bore up against the tide. The river 
set its current against me and bore down for civilisation and the 
city. 

The river was an Australian river, and its winding reaches 
were framed in gnarled stems and twisted branches of quaint device, 
in twining creepers and drooping, lance-shaped leaves, in rough 
boulders and grim caves where the black man had crouched beside 
his boomerang and devoured his feast of shell-fish. 

Bu b the caves now bear the legend of Smith, Brown and Jones ; 
the boulders advertise patent soaps ; among clearings in tortuous 
gum-bush gleam the white turrets of the modem villa ; on the 
slopes the creepers have been cut away for the straight, trim beds of 
artificial garden. 

The legends and the soaps, the villas and the gardens, are all 
products of civilisation. 

I paddled up the river. 

Suddenly I came upon a Relic of Romance. A dismantled 
chimney, a ruined wall over which trailed fresh green leaves, an old 
horse browsing where a cottage room had been, some soft-eyed 
cattle gazing at me, — all the elements of a domestic idyll. I stepped 
ashore to shed a few tears over the idyll and analyse the elements ; 
some of them resolved themselves into disused boilers pervaded by a 
peculiar odour. 

Then I remembered. I stood on the site of a boiling-down 
establishment which had once polluted the air. 



196 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

The boiling-down process was a product, and it had moved 
down the river. 
I paddled up. 

At a bend of the stream rose a tall building, with straight 
lines, jutting outhouses and gabled roof. Some terraced cottages 
stood near, also straight-lined and gable-roofed. Opposite, twining 
greenery and rich underscrub and starry flannel -flower nestled in 
the curve under the shadow of the cool cliff. Here, utilitarian 
energy bristled in the glare. 

I went inside the building. It was a factory, with whirring 
wheels and ponderous grindstones and huge vats, all used in the 
production of a fancy food for digestions spoiled by civilisation. 
Strong men were busy among the machines, slight women were busy 
in the packing-rooms. I spoke to one of the girls : she was young 
and not uncomely ; her head was bent and her nimble fingers folded 
squares of cardboard into box-form and pasted on the paper covers. 

&quot; How many can you make in a day ? &quot; I asked. 

&quot;About three hundred,&quot; she answered in a monotone, her 
fingers still folding. 

Outside, the mullet were leaping, the loose-leaved branches 
were idly waving to other branches in the water, the laugh of the 
kookaburra pealed in the distance. 

Inside, the sun streamed hotly on pale faces and tired fingers. 

I looked at the girl, — her face was dainty and wistfuL 

** Don&apos;t you sometimes hate it ? &quot; I said. 

The girl looked at me, and answered : 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

She was a product of civilisation and was drifting down the 
river. I paddled up. 

At last I lighted on my camping-ground. It was roomy and 
retired, protected by a shore of black ooze and a cliff undisfigured by 
names ; a waterhole was near at hand. I contentedly lighted my 
camp-fire, and sat down to meditate on products. 



PRODUCTS. 197 

^K Suddenly a boatful of them arrived and took possession. They 
were undeniable : male products in speckless flannels, straw hats and 
city respectability ; female products in gay draperies and city 
smirk. 

I fled to my waterhole. There the water dripped with a 
musical patter down the ruddy clifis ; the yellow &quot; speckle-eye &apos;^ 
flitted about the branches with cheerful chirp ; the sunbeams 
quivered through the interweaving leaves ; the locusts played their 
bagpipes with a subdued drone. I was listening to it when the 
product in flannels swooped down on me, armed with curiosity and 
conversation. 

&quot;Nice place,&quot; he said, annexing my waterhole; *&apos;nice soap,&quot; 
appropriating mine ; &quot; nice weather, nice camping-ground, nice to 
get away from the city now and then.&quot; 

When I went back the products were gathered round my fire, 
crooning &quot; Daisy Bell &quot; preparatory to going down the river. I 
paddled up. 

On the oozy bank I spied, afar off, a flamingo stalking in the 
mud. On nearing, my flamingo resolved itself into an elderly 
gentleman in a red shirt paddling for bait. 

This looked like close intimacy with Nature. I made advances 
to the flamingo, which presently took a bath, resumed human attire, 
and conducted me over a thriving orchard. 

I admired a fruitful vine on a barren rock. I marvelled at a 
peach-bearing tree which had sprung into existence in a crevice. I 
stood beneath a forty-year-old apple-tree which formed a natural 
bower, and dreamed of the children who had frolicked under 
its boughs. 

The flamingo&apos;s voice broke in : 

&quot; I don&apos;t get half I used to for them apples,&quot; it said ; &quot; if I 
could n&apos;t do my own cartage by road I &apos;d give the land up ; it don&apos;t 
pay these days.&quot; 

The flamingo was also a product. 

I paddled up the river. 



198 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

I swerved aside to enter a sinuous creek, just wide enough for 
my boat. On one marshy side tall rushes grew, on the other old 
trees caressed my head with their drooping boughs. The water 
rippled under the keel, and a dog&apos;s baying echoed far away. 

I drifted up to a thickly-set orchard, with a soft carpet of green 
weed beneath the peach- and nectarine-dropping trees. In the fore- 
ground a group of men were busy sorting fruit and packing it in 
market cases. 

The master stood up, a tall, well-built young fellow, and as I 
stepped on shore he came forward with grave courtesy : 

&quot; You are a stranger,&quot; he said ; &quot; and &quot; his glance wandered 

uneasily from my unkempt beard, doubtful garments, and bare feet, 
to the boat. She was trim and shipshape. His glance returned, 
satisfied. &quot;And an artist?&quot; he continued; &quot;a good many come 
our way. You are welcome. The orchard is more interesting 
further on, and you will find some fruit to your liking.&quot; 

So I had lighted on Paradise at last, and civilisation was in the 
rear. As I lay under the enclosing boughs of a pear-tree that 
had seen three generations, catching glimpses, between the clustering 
fruit, of tree-ferns guarding scarlet tomato and ripening watermelon, 
— with the murmur of the creek, the buzz of the bee, and the hum of 
the fly in my ear, — I felt I had nothing to reproach Adam and Eve 
with. Their little interview with the serpent had not robbed me 
of Nature&apos;s spoils. 

But another sound disturbed my reverie. A sibilant sound, 
recalling city products. Creeping forward stealthily, I peered 
through the branches, and there, in the gathering shadows, I spied 
a pair — of the species known as larrikin. They were hard at work, 
too, and the bags beside them suggested weight. 

A hand fell on my shoulder. 

&quot; Will you help me ? &quot; said the quiet voice of the sturdy young 
farmer. &quot; We are evenly matched, and if we surprise them it will 
be a sure thing.&quot; 

It was a sure thing. Within half-an-hour the invaders were 
on their way towards the hospitable police-station. Apparently 



PROLUCTS,

they were waste products. I had come painfully near civilisation 
again. 

&quot; I am much indebted to you,&quot; said the farmer. &quot; They would 
have escaped had I lost time going to look for my men, and really 
this sort of thing is not to be borne. The rights of property are 
sacred ; I see you are with me there.&quot; 

I was not with him there, because I have no property. My 
boat was a hired one. But I understood. 

Still, I was sorry. It struck me that my farmer was a product, 
too, in his own simple fashion, and that I had not yet wandered 
far enough. 

I wished to paddle up the river. 

&quot;Wait,&quot; said the farmer; &quot;you must come up to the house ; 
we both need a drink after that little aflfair.&quot; 

&quot; This stuff won&apos;t harm anyone,&quot; he added presently, holding 
up the aromatic golden liquor to the light. &quot; You don&apos;t find this 
brand in every house, and where you do it &apos;s not always genuine.&quot; 

I glanced at the brand ; it was &quot; Bertrandt and Co.&quot; Bertrandt 
is the rich godfather to whom I look for a legacy. 

&quot; Do they dare to tamper with it ? &quot; I asked righteously. 

Tampering with Bertrandt&apos;s brandy might affect my legacy. 

&quot;Not with this,&quot; laughed the farmer; &quot;I have special oppor- 
tunities for securing the real thing,&quot; — and he whispered a word in 
my ear. &quot; We all like our little comforts, and we like them good,&quot; 
he added cheerily. 

&quot; Yes,&quot; I answered absently, &quot; we like them good.&quot; 

Was it really five years since I had written to Bertrandt. 

Then I realised that I also was a product. 

I paddled down the river.

AN ERROR IN ADMINISTRATION. 

SMITH was brought up in the city, though his fathers before 
him had been men of the forest and sea ; and he naturally 
became a clerk. But the blood asserted itself, and he threw 
away his billet to go up-country, and finally got a job on a Gippsland 
selection, where he spent his days and nights in the &quot; cleared 
country &quot; with the sheep. In Gippsland the country is thoroughly 
cleared when most of the undergrowth has been hacked or burned 
away, and the trees ringbarked so that they all stand dead. 

Such a country is bad for the nerves, especially for those of a 
man like Smith, whose father had not been particularly virtuous. 
It consists of an interminable stretch of gaunt gray timber, and in 
the morning and evening twilight the dead trees seem to wobble 
their crooked arms towards one another, and join their skeleton 
hands in a ghastly, jerky minuet which makes your flesh creep. 
They begin to do this when you have known them for about a week ; 
and very soon, if you have a steady head and an adequate supply of 
tobacco, they stop, and turn into inanimate timber again. But an 
ex-clerk who has been addicted to inhaling cheap-cigarette smoke, 
and finds a pipe too much for him, sees their antics for a good 
while longer. When the darkness has put a stop to this entertain- 
ment, the sheep sometimes get restless, and an unquiet flock of sheep 
at midnight makes a most dispiriting noise, which is a shade worse 
than the dead stillness. Sometimes, too, a tree falls without any 
apparent reason just as you are dropping off to sleep ; and when a 
Gippsland tree comes down it shakes a whole hillside and sounds 
louder than a cannon. Altogether, a cleared selection in South 
Gippsland is a cheerless home for a solitary neurotic man. 

So it came to pass that Smith contracted many little 



AN ERROR IN ADMINISTRATION, OQl 

peculiarities in his behaviour. He would spend hours on his back, 
looking up towards the sky and trying to fix the outline of a tree on 
his mind, and it always vexed him that he forgot one limb as soon 
as he set himself to master the next. He began to talk to the sheep 
like human beings, for he had no dog ; and he swore at them 
because they did not answer him in English and he had forgotten the 
French and Latin he had learnt at school. He got tired of the trees 
being so gray, and he took to staining them with grass, and watering 
their bases in the hope of making them sprout again. He was 
conscious that there was something wrong in his being out there 
all alone, and he came to the conclusion that he had a deadly enemy 
somewhere, but he could n&apos;t quite settle who it was. It was n&apos;t the 
sheep, for they seemed as frightened as himself ; and it was n&apos;t the 
trees, for two of them had fallen within a chain of his hut without 
doing any damage. After this event he regarded them as his 
especial friends, and he laughed and clapped his hands when the 
dance got more than usually mixed — in the mazurka, for instance. 
At other than twilight hours he sat still and brooded over his wrongs. 

One day the boss rode out himself instead of sending a man 
with Smith&apos;s rations, and explained that he intended to build new 
yards where the hut stood, because the railway was going to pass 
right there. The shepherd smiled as if he did n&apos;t quite understand, 
and said that the railway would find it rather lonely, and he hoped 
it would n&apos;t hurt his trees. &quot; They &apos;re just learning the quadrilles,&quot; 
he said. The boss stared at him and went away. Soon after, a 
couple of men came and told Smith to take his sheep out of the 
road, and he drew off and watched them for the rest of the afternoon. 
When it dawned on him what they were going to do, and he saw 
the destruction of all his hopes of the grand chain in the evening, he 
went up and asked them who had ordered it. Then he sat down 
and thought a great deal about the boss, until at last he came to a 
decision. 

Now it is very clear that the Government of Victoria has much 
to answer for. If it had not decided to build that railway, Smith&apos;s 
trees would have been left untouched, and he might have gone on 



202 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

quite harmlessly until it was discovered that big timber was bad for 
his brain. The sheep would not have been left alone that night 
while a man with a sharpened knife made his way to the homestead. 
The kitchen-maid would not have been driven screaming along the 
passage, three men would have been without a very exciting 
experience of ten minutes&apos; duration, and one of them would not walk 
lame. Also, the boss&apos;s only son would be two months younger and 
a good deal stronger, and his wife would be able to give an 
intelligent answer to a simple question — which, as matters stand, 
she cannot do. 

Smith came out, probably, better than anyone else. He was 
supported for six months in an asylum, and then sent to a situation 
up Yackandandah way, where he will not see a stretch of big timber 
in a lifetime. If he ever happens to get into different country, 
most probably someone will be murdered.

A BRIDAL PARTY AND A DOG. 

IT was afternoon when I rode into Bear Gully. I was bound for 
the railway-station five miles north, and at first thought to ride 

straight through the almost-deserted hamlet. Bear Gully had 
once a dozen or so houses. That was before the railway-station 
opened in the north. Now the pub. was the only inhabited 
dwelling in the place, and it lingered partly to catch teamsters and 
occasional wanderers, and partly, seemingly, because it was used to 
lingering there and never thought of shifting. 

The day was hot and steamy after late rain. Several puddles 
of water&apos;studded the flat in front. The pub. verandah was odiously 
dirty. Mud was spattered on the posts and on the weatherboard 
walls, and the entire establishment looked disreputable in the 
extreme. A brown shabby dog of mixed collie and retriever 
breed lay at the far end of the verandah, and eyed me in a peculiarly 
suspicious way. However, throwing the bridle over a hook, I 
walked in. 

&quot; Anyone here ? &quot; I asked. There were glasses on the counter 
and bottles on a shelf behind, but no one in attendance. 

&quot;Anyone here?&quot; I repeated. Thinking the publican might 
be temporarily busy elsewhere, I turned out of the bar to have a look 
at the dog, whose appearance had attracted me. 

The brute had partly struggled to his feet and was snapping at 
something, to me invisible, which seemed to annoy him. He was as 
Jirty as his surroundings, with large lumps of mud sticking here and 
there to his shaggy sides. As I approached him, in making a 
particularly vicious snap over his right shoulder, he overbalanced 
and rolled on his back. I went closer. His eyes were shut, but he 
moved his head spasmodically, and every few seconds snapped at 



204 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

some unseen enemy. I judged his complaint to be a kind of local 
paralysis combined with illusions of the senses. 

Going back, I re-entered the bar. To my surprise a red, swollen- 
faced man sat behind the counter. 

&quot; Hello,&quot; I said, &quot; I thought the house abandoned. Is n&apos;t it 
hot ? &quot; The man was looking towards, but beyond me. His eyes 
were bloodshot and the lids heavy. 

&quot; What &apos;11 y&apos; &apos;ave ? &quot; he asked, almost in a whisper. I wished I 
had ridden on, but as things had gone so far I determined to make 
the best of them. 

&quot; A little whisky,&quot; I answered. &quot; It &apos;s terrible work riding in 
this clammy heat.&quot; He gripped the counter with one hand, while 
reaching for the bottle with the other. He looked at the bottle as 
he looked at me — that is, he appeared to be looking far away beyond 
it. Catching it, however, he placed it before me. 

&quot; You don&apos;t seem very well,&quot; I remarked. 

No answer. 

&quot; That &apos;g a queer dog of yours outside,&quot; I added. 

No answer. 

I swallowed the drink and placed a shilling on the counter. 
The man put the bottle back, picked up the shilling in a dreamy, 
death-like silence, and then, with a shout that shook the rafters, 
jumped several feet in the air, and turning round, rushed through 
the bar entrance into an adjoining room. Recovering from the 
shock, I followed him. I had heard a crash, and concluded he 
had fallen over something. He had ; and there he lay on the floor, 
evidently injured, though to what extent I could not tell. 

&quot; What &apos;s up ? &quot; I asked. He made desperate efforts to rise, but 
knee or ankle was damaged and he could not get on his feet. But 
he snapped at me with his mouth, and, when T stood aside out of 
his view, he snapped and struck at objects invisible to me. 

&quot; Who the mischief &apos;s looking after this den ? &quot; I mused, walking 
through the house to the rear of the premises. In a large room, like 
a bushman&apos;s dining-room, my eye caught a youngish man in shirt 
and trousers, sitting at a heavy table, engaged at some absorbing 



A BRIDAL PARTY AND A DOG, 205 

work. His face was toward me, and, though he was unshaven and 
unwashed, I at once set him down for a city clerk. 

&quot;Well, now,&quot; I began, walking in; &quot;I&apos;m glad to come on 
someone in his senses. What &apos;s up with the party inside ? &quot; By 
this time I noticed that the heavy wooden table was pitted all over 
with small cavities, some the size of marbles, and others as large as 
eggcups, and that my new acquaintance was busily digging out a 
fresh one with his sheath knife. He did not notice my words, but 
worked on. 

&quot; What do all these holes mean ? &quot; 

&quot; Sh — sh I &quot; he whispered. &quot; I &apos;m getting &apos;em all out. Oh, 
they can&apos;t escape me ! Centipedes — see 1 Scorpions — see ? I &apos;m 
getting &apos;em out ! I &apos;m getting &apos;em out ! &quot; 

Whipping a wriggling shaving of wood from the hole he worked 
on, he threw it on the floor and, with blood-curdling yells, jumped 
and danced on it. When the fit was over he resumed his seat and 
went on calmly with his work. 

As I unhitched my horse the cross-bred collie, still snapping at 
the air, wriggled to the edge of the verandah, and rolled over into a 
pool of water on the road beneath. 

I did n&apos;t look back. &quot; I &apos;11 report the facts to the authorities,&quot; 
I said, &quot; and leave the job to them.&quot; On turning the first bend in 
the road I came flush on a horse and trap. 

&quot; Ye &apos;re fram beyaut % &quot; asked a sergeant of police who drove 
the trap. &quot; Did ye lave them all well ? &quot; Then he informed me 
that he and the constable sitting beside him were bound for the 
Bear pub. to carry away the remaining inmates. 

&quot; Ye see,&quot; went on the sergeant, &quot; we tuk away the wimmin 
this marnin&apos;. It all came about through a weddin&apos; as done it. The 
darter of the oul&apos; man was spliced three weeks ago to a young fella, 
a clerk from town, an&apos; they kep&apos; the cellybrashun up till ivery man 
jack has the d.t.&apos;s. I tuk away the bride an&apos; &apos;er mother an&apos; an oul&apos; 
woman cook in this thrap this marnin&apos;, an&apos; now I &apos;m goin&apos; back for 
the oul&apos; man an&apos; the bridegroom.&quot;

&quot; And the dog ? &quot; I said. 

&quot; An&apos; the dog,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;The dog &apos;s ivery bit as bad 
as the rest. It &apos;s the worst case of profligacy iver occurred in this 
part in my time, an&apos; the dog &apos;s as bad &apos;s any wan of them. This &apos;11

OW beautiful your hair is, Chalice ! 



wife&apos;s rich brown hair hanging down, his artistic soul 
demanded the bestowal of praise upon it. 

*&apos; I do believe that is the tenth time this week you have said 
that,&quot; she replied, laughing up at him. &quot;Yes, I have lovely hair, 
but you should have seen my mother&apos;s. Hers almost swept the 
ground.&quot; 

He walked nearer to her. 

&quot; What a lonely life you have had, ray dear ! Your father 

killed, your mother dead, and your brother how old did you say 

your brother was when he was drowned, Chalice 1 &quot; 

She bent to tie her shoe. He didn&apos;t see her face whiten. 
&quot; He was just twenty,&quot; she said faintly, from her stooping position. 

&quot; And you have been alone, except for two old servants, ever 
since — till now ? &quot; 

&quot; Yes,&quot; came more faintly. 

She made an effort. 

&quot; Yes, I was very lonely. But I don&apos;t think of those days now. 
They have gone. All my best days are before me. O, Ted ! &quot; with 
the fervour of truth in her voice, &quot; I thank God every night for my 
happiness — for having met you. I love you so. I would die 
for you ! &quot; 

She put her arms round his neck. &quot; I don&apos;t believe any woman 
ever loved a man as I do you.&quot; 

He laughed and kissed her. 

&quot; It was well, too, for me that I stumbled across your home. 
Chalice.&quot; 



208 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

She dropped her arms and spoke hurriedly. &quot;Ted, when shall 
we go and see the Gap ? You promised me a week ago, and the wet 
weather may set in any time.&quot; 

&quot;We can go to-day if you like.&quot; 

&quot; To-day ? This morning ? &quot; He nodded. &quot; Oh, that will be 
splendid.&quot; 

She clapped her hands, and her face flushed with pleasure at 
the thought of the happy day before her. She was all eagerness to 
start. 

&quot; I will run and put on my dress now. And you won&apos;t be long 
with the horses, will you ? I will ride Lightning to-day.&quot; 

A horse galloped up the path. Chalice could n&apos;t see, but she 
knew who it was. It was Tom O&apos;Connor from Tawonga station 
with the mails. Her husband went to meet him ; she heard a few 
murmuring words, and, as was the usual custom, heard Tom 
dismount and walk into the dining-room with Ted. She knew she 
need n&apos;t hurry in dressing now, for Tom was such a talker. She 
played lovingly with her wedding-ring. Three months married ! 
How the time had passed ! It seemed only yesterday that — God ! 
she must n&apos;t commence to think, else — she began humming to drown 
her thoughts. How beautiful the wattle looked ! There was a 
branch bending down to the verandah, laden with blossoms. The 
yellow would look pretty against her dress. 

She finished dressing, and stepped out and picked a bunch. 

A slight, stifled scream escaped her as she looked towards the 
horse. This was n&apos;t Tom&apos;s sturdy little chestnut — this great, black, 
sweating horse ! It turned its head. She staggered against the 
wall. What a fool she was ! More men than one had a black horse 
with a white mark on its forehead. It must be a station-hand&apos;s. 
She would go and pat it. She went up closer. Her hand extended, 
but swiftly drew back again. Her eyes dilated with fright and 
fear. The stitches ! The stitches in the saddle-cloth that she had 
sewn in six months ago stared her in the face ! 

Blindly groping her way to her window, she wondered, dully, 
what they were saying in the dining-room. She must hear. She 



BROKEN CHINA. 209 

must know. She would go along the verandah. No, they would 
see her, they would hear her — she would go through the bath-room, 
and steal quietly along till she came to the door. 

As she crept along the hall, a deep, mellow voice was speaking. 
She clenched her teeth. 

Edward Murray stood with his back to the speaker, and played 
with his watch-chain. 

&quot; Chalice is n&apos;t even her name. She adopted it as a tribute to 
her own beauty. She would have liked every man to have drunk of 
her. Many men have. Even I ; and even &quot; — with a savage glance 
at the obstinately-turned back — &quot; you ! &quot; 

The woman crouched outside like a beaten cur. 

&quot; She drove her old mother to the grave. She has played with 
men as with flowers, tossing them aside when tired of their fragrance. 
She would have been another man&apos;s mistress, if I had not come 
along — so she chose me. The house you took her from three months 
ago was my house. And if you had looked you would have found a 
little grave &quot; 

The door-handle made a rasping noise — the man stopped 
speaking ; the handle turned, and before he could rise from his chair 
the slash of a riding- whip had come across his face. 

Furious and blinded with pain, he sprang forward, but recoiled 
as he saw Chalice. 

All her anguish and terror seemed to have frozen into her 
frame. Her arm was held high up, the whip grasped in her tense 
fingers. 

The man turned his eyes away from her white face. 

There was a moment&apos;s silence. 

She felt she was going mad. She should not have come in so 

soon. She should have waited till her husband had spoken, then 

O God! why didn&apos;t he speak? Why didn&apos;t he move? Even 
shuffle his feet — anything ! Anything was better than his 
standing like a silent, awful Fate behind her ! 

She caught the click of his chain, as he threw it up and down. 

He sauntered up to her. 

N 



210 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; A fine attitude, mr,dam, a fine attitude — that of outraged 
virtue — or furious vice, eh ? It has a fine effect.&quot; 

Her body relaxed ; the whip dropped to the floor. 

He put his hand on her shoulder and half-whispered into 
her ear. 

&quot; So your lonely life has had its compensations, my little wife ? 
The chirping of the cricket, the trilling of the creek, the rustle of 
the gum-leaves, the scent of eucalyptus — all these things you used 
so poetically to tell me about, have not, then, always satisfied your 
delicate womanly instincts ? &quot; 

He paused. 

&quot; You do not speak. Why don&apos;t you call this man a liar ? 
Perhaps,&quot; taking her hands and patting them, &quot;you are shy ! &quot; 

She looked up at him, all her dumb agony in her eyes. 

&quot; As shy, perhaps, as the day I knocked at your door, down by 
the creek, and you opened it, and I looked at you ; your head 
drooped with shyness — my little innocent one ! &quot; 

She shivered as he passed his hand caressingly over her 
hair. 

&quot; As shy, perhaps, as the day you lent me your — er — father&apos;s 
horse — a black one,&quot; — smiling over her head to the man opposite 
him, — &quot;with — er — a white mark on its forehead. And- ^io you 
remember ? — we rode, and rode, and rode, and all else was forgotten. 
And your hair came tumbling &quot; 

&quot; Edward ! Edward ! &quot; 

&quot; Over your shoulders, and I — kissed — you. And your sweet, 
maidenly blushes ! — ha — ha — ha ! &quot; 

She broke into sobs. 

&quot; Ah, we had merry times down in that little home. Every 
day brought forth a new pleasure. Every day was coloured with 
our joy — our happiness.&quot; 

Jack Morton&apos;s eyes glared at him. 

&quot; How timidly your little hands used to seek mine ! How your 
eyes used to sparkle as I approached ! &quot; 

&quot; Don&apos;t, don&apos;t ! That time is sacred to me.&quot; 



BROKEN CHINA. 211 

&quot; How lovingly your arms twined round my neck ! How soft 
jour whispers ! &quot; 

&quot; Have pity &quot; 

&quot; Ah, Chalice, forgive me ! I have done wrong. This life I 
have brought you to is too rough —too coarse a setting for such a 
jewel. You must obey the cravings of your spotless purity ; return 
to the creek that calls you, to the home that waits for you — to your 
own virtuous loneliness.&quot; 

His hand slid down to hers. 

Jack Morton anticipated him. He rushed forward, snatched 
Chalice&apos;s hand, wrenched the ring off, and threw it with all his force 
into the other&apos;s face. 

There was a moment of terrified silence. Mad fury possessed 
both men. They looked at each other, the white, quivering face of 
Murray contrasting strangely with the dark, distorted countenance 
of Morton. 

A startled sob came between them. Murray recovered himself 
He flicked some dust off his coat. How foolish, and what a waste of 
energy to lose his temper over these two wretches ! 

He spoke in a smart, business-like way. &quot; I thank you, my 
man. You have performed that little duty more forcibly than ever 
I would have done. You had both better go now. The woman&apos;s 
belongings will be sent on to the station.&quot; 

He went towards the door. She ran after him, hardly under- 
standing. 

&quot; Ted, Ted ! — what do you mean ? You are not leaving me?&quot; 
Her voice grew shrill with fear. &quot; You will not go from me ? No, 
no, you will have pity ; you . . . Ted ! don&apos;t go, don&apos;t go ! &quot; She 
caught his sleeve, in a vain effort to stop him. He pushed her back. 
&quot; Oh, have mercy ! I love you so. I — oh, God ! don&apos;t leave me.&quot; 
Her sobs choked her. &quot; Let me stay with you. I will not speak 
to you, nor touch you ; only let me see you sometimes. Edward,&quot; 
pleadingly, &quot; I will be your servant.&quot; 

&quot; I always insist on my servants being clean ! &quot; 

She gave a little moan. &quot;Yes, yes; but you are lifting me. 



212 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

You have shown me Heavsn. No, no, don&apos;t go ! — you have shown 

me &quot; He found it a difficulty to pass through the door with 

her clinging to him. &quot; God ! For the sake &quot; His foot 

advanced and tripped hers. &quot; For the sake Ted ! don&apos;t leave 



me 



f&quot; 



She fell down. 

&quot; You brute ! &quot; roared Jack Morton to the closed door. 

He ran to pick her up ; but she was shrieking and beating her 
hands against the door, and calling on her husband. He dropped 
his head in his hands. He had never seen grief like this before ; 
and something like remorse for what he had done was coming 
to him. 

After a little while her cries grew fainter ; her breath came in 
exhausted gasps. 

He raised her up. 

&quot; Chalice, my poor Chalice ! &quot; he said, brokenly ; &quot; don&apos;t cry, 
dear. You must come and live with me again. It shall be as if 
this man had never lived. Hush ! And — God forgive me ! — I will 
put a ring on your finger this time. My ring will be more sacred, 
more binding, in my sorrow, than his was, in his weak ignorance. 
Come, Chalice, come back with me.&quot; 

&quot; Yes, yes, I will come. I don&apos;t care, now,&quot; she said, wildly. 
&quot; Nothing matters now. Everything is over. Only take me away ; 
a long way from here.&quot; 

Morton swore, under his breath, at the hollow misery in 
her eyes. 

He drew her on to the verandah and swung her into the saddle* 
He sprang up behind her. The horse&apos;s head was turned, and they 
moved down the path. They had not gone very far when she cried 
out to stop the horse. 

&quot;Stop, stop! — pull up!&quot; She dragged fiercely at the reins. 
^*Jack, pull up! I must see him again. I can&apos;t go away yet. Loose 
your hands ! He may have called me, and I not have heard him. 
He may &quot; — with a wild hope — &quot; have relented. Let me go — let 
me go ! &quot; 



BROKEN CHINA. 213 

She dropped to the ground, and ran back, the thought of his 
calling her uppermost in her mind. 

&quot; Come back, Chalice, come back ! &quot; 

&quot; No, no ; I must see him.&quot; 

&quot; Well, there he is — curse the fellow — look 1 &quot; 

&quot;Where— where?&quot; 

&quot; There, by that window &quot; — ^pointing with his whip. 

She looked, and dropped her head. 

Ted was standing, delicately waving his hand to them. 

She was very quiet as Jack lifted her up again, and her face 
was hidden in his sleeve as they galloped away.

THE DISPERSION OF MRS. BLACK. 

**T KNOW,&quot; said old Bill, meditatively, &quot;that it takes more &apos;a 
I one to get up a proper dispersion, but you will find that old 
woman Black were dispersed pretty wide, for all that. 

&quot; Yer see, it were this way. Old Sol Black were a whaler dowrt 
at Maketu, and like all sich, he got a Maori wife and a lot o&apos; kids. 
Well, his old &apos;ooman met with a haccident one day in war-time. 
Old Sol used to help the tribe in battle, and on this hpccasion they 
got well licked, and Sol&apos;s wife got eat. Sol thought he would get a 
white woman to look after the kids, and he goes to Auckland in the 
Flying Fish and brings one back. 

**She were a widder wot never had no kids of her own, which 
was just into Sol&apos;s hand. She were a big, fat heifer, and it took a 
tidy plarster to make her a frock, so she seldom wore one. She 
minded the kids all right till they got spliced or went off on their 
own hook. 

&quot; Arter that the old &apos;ooman used to go about the pah jabbering 
and chiacking with one and another. She were generally barefooted, 
just like a Maori woman. She kep&apos; pretty straight, &apos;cept when 
there was any rum or square-face about ; then she &apos;d get her whack 
anyhow. 

&quot;They &apos;d shifted to Rotorua by this time, and their whare was 
on the lake shore ; but most of the natives lived on the hill. Old 
Sol was away ketching crawfish in the lake when one on &apos;em on the 
hill got up a five-gallon keg o&apos; rum. The old &apos;ooman smelt it, and 
was up there on the tear quick. It were dark when she tacked for 
home, pretty well boozed. There was a lot of hot-springs and 
cooking-holes and biling-pools o&apos; all sorts just off the track ; but. 
Lord ! she &apos;d been along that track all hours. 



THE DISPERSION OF MRS. BLACK. 216 

&quot; Well, there was n&apos;t no one at home, so nobody missed her, 
anyhow. The old go-ashore which was their bell was a-sounding for 
morning prayers, for they prays twice a day, do them natives, quite 
public in the church, and when the first lot got a bit on the track 
they saw a blanket which had caught by a corner on a old tea-tree 
stump, right acrost the track, and the further corner was just 
on the edge of the bilingest of all them biling springs. 

&quot; When they looked in there was a lot of hile on the top, and as 
the water heaved and rolled with the heat of hell a lot of whitish, 
yallerish, flaky and ropy-looking stuff was a-rolliDg round with the 
hile and water. There was some o&apos; them fresh green ferns on the 
further edge a-hanging over, and by-an&apos;-by a bigger bile-up than 
common fetched some white rag out from hunder the ferns all lapped 
and twisted round summut hard. The niggers &apos;d got to know afore 
this what was the matter from the blanket, and when they saw the 
white rag they was certint, &apos;cos them was all her togs the night 
afore. 

&quot; They fished out the rag and found it were lapped and twisted 
round the neck and breast of pore Mrs. Black. The head was biled 
off and likewise the arms and backbone was broke through the 
middle, what with the rousting about it got when the bile was most 
wiolent, and I alius heard say she were a tender critter. 

&quot; They did n&apos;t know what to do all to wonst. They thought if 
they got her out and put her in a soap-box she &apos;d run through the 
jints. A&apos; larst one on &apos;em who &apos;d been to school said the Rumuns 
used to put their dead &apos;uns into jars arter burning on &apos;em to ashes, 
and stick &apos;em on the mantel where they was alius handy to cry over. 
He thought a callybash, such as they put birds and pork in when 
they are biled down in their own fat, would about fill the bill, and 
it would comfort old Sol to have his wife in a funeral burn, as he 
called it. He was a rare schollard for a native, that chap. 

&quot; They agreed to that, and got some old bent tin and pumpkin 
shells, and a canoe baler and a long-handle shovel, and ladled the 
old girl out. The bones was mostly low down fooling around in the 
heddy where the bottom of the hole ought to be. 



216 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; They kep&apos; the bones separate, and when the head came out 
from hunder the ferns it were quite white and no thin&apos; on it to speak 
on. Some of the red hairs was a-twisted round the other pieces, 
and some was in locks of hair by themselves among the hile. Bein&apos; 
as she were a copper- topped &apos;un, the hairs were n&apos;t as heasy to see as 
black &apos;uns, but they was very careful. 

&quot; They got a good large gourd a couple of foot high, open at the 
top, and they put all the small goods in ; but the worst job was 
skimming off the hile, for they said they would like her to be all 
there. But she were n&apos;t, for I see a good-looking Maori wench 
a-fishing out the finger and toe-nails with a pawa shell, and she wore 
&apos;em for a necklace the next day. 

&quot; The shovel came in werry handy for skimming the hile. The 
worst was keeping the water out ; and they said if that was scooped 
up and put in the hipUj it might be unpleasant for various reasons 
to Sol when he went to weep beside the burn. 

&quot; A&apos; larst they got her fixed and a flat bit of tin on the openin&apos;, 
and they said they &apos;d stand the jimmy on top of that to give it a 
proper finish like. It were a melancholy business, — some o&apos; the 
women was a-crying and a-howling all the time. The bones they 
tied together wery neat and put &apos;em in a case o&apos; titara bark what 
had had smoked heels in. Then they concluded to put it in the 
store out of the way of the kids, who might think she were pork if 
left in the whare. 

•• When Sol came back he was quite pleased with the pains 
they &apos;d took, and he had a good look at her and gave her a nod when 
he left, but he did n&apos;t go and weep beside the burn, and the schollard 
said that was because he wasn&apos;t a Rumun which they thought 
he were. 

&quot; Well, she stood on that shelf for years and nobody took no 
liberties with her, and the sight of her bony face kept the kids 
away, till one day a tourist came along who wanted to get the skull 
of a cannybul for a skyantific society, and one o&apos; the young men 
sold Mrs. Black&apos;s skull for half-a-crown and a long beer. 



THS DISFSJRSJOir OF MBS. BLACK. 217 

&quot; That was the beginning on it. Yer see, there was no brand 
on when the head was waa gone, same as all on us, and no 
telling what was inside the hipu. Old Sol never went there, and 
the tomb of Mrs. Black was neglected by him as ought to have&lt;iecked it with flowers as is common. 

&apos;* By-an&apos;-by the kids got to shovin&apos; their fingers in when they 
got a chance, but tliey seemed to want henthoosiasm, and she did n&apos;t 
get scattered much that way ; but there was an old tohunga priest 
there as carved things out o&apos; human bone, and he came acrost the 
bark case o&apos; bones one day when he was a-skirmishing around for 
-dried heels. He looted &apos;em, and made two flutes and some horna- 
ments they call aurei and a search-warrant for the hair and a whole 
biling o&apos; fish-hooks out of Mrs. Black&apos;s bones, and, bein&apos; a noted 
tohunga, he sold &apos;em to all the tribes of both islands. 

&quot; Then they was going pigeon-shooting one day and one of the 
young fallows dropped on the hipu with Mrs. Black in it. Yer see, 
she looked summut like mutton-bird hile. Well, they hiled their 
^ns wita her and their bridles and saddles, and them as &apos;ad boots 
hiled then ; and the thick part of her at the bottom of the hipu 
they threw into the lake, and the gold and silver fishes scoffed her, 
and that just about spread out poor Mrs. Black. 

&quot; Well, she worn&apos;t missed for a long time, till at larst one of 
Sol&apos;s daughters came and asked after her foster-mother, and they 
went to look and could n&apos;t find her. It all came out though when 
they came to ask, and them as had took pains to ladle her out and 
bottle her was pretty wild, but Sol said it didn&apos;t matter as he 
knowed on, shg always was a terror to wander, but it might be 
orkard at the list trump, but then agen he thought the longer she 
kep&apos; away from the Judgment the better for her, and perhaps it 
were all for the best Amen. 

&quot; Thanks, boss ; I don&apos;t mind if I do.&quot; 
And BDl did.

WHITE-WHEN-HE &apos;8-WANTED. 

BUCKALONG was a big freehold of some eighty thousand 
acres, belonging to an absentee syndicate, and therefore run 
in a most niggardly style. There was a manager on twa 
hundred pounds a year, Sandy M&apos;Gregor to wit — a hard-headed old 
Scotchman known as &quot;four-eyed M&apos;Gregor,&quot; because he wore 
spectacles. For assistants, he had half-a-dozen of us — ^jackercos and 
colonial-experiencers — who got nothing a year, and earned it. We 
had, in most instances, paid premiums to learn the noble art of 
squatting, which now appears to me hardly worth studyirg, for so 
much depends on luck that a man with a head as long as a horse&apos;s 
has little better chance than the fool just imported. Besides the 
manager and the jackeroos, there were a few boundaiy-riders to 
prowl round the fences of the vast paddocks. This constituted the 
whole station staff. 

Buckalong was on one of the main routes by which stock were 
taken to market, or from the plains to the tablelands, and vice versa. 
Great mobs of travelling sheep constantly passed through the run^ 
eating up the grass and vexing the soul of the manager. By law^ 
sheep must travel six miles per day, and they must keep within half- 
a-mile of the road. Of course we kept all the grass near the road 
eaten bare, to discourage travellers from coming Ihat way. Such 
hapless wretches as did venture through Buckalong used to try hard 
to stray from the road and pick up a feed, but old Sandy was alwaya 
ready for them, and would have them dogged righi through the run. 
This bred feuds, and bad language, and personal combats between 
us and the drovers, whom we looked upon as natural enemies. Then 
the men who came through with mobs of cattle used to pull down 
the paddock fences at night, and slip the cattle in for refreshments ; 



WHITE- WHENHE &apos;S- WANTED. 219 

but old Sandy often turned out at two or three a.m. to catch a big 
mob of bullocks in the horse-paddock, and then oflf they went to 
Buckalong pound. The drovers, as in duty bound, attributed the 
trespass to accident — broken rails, and so on — and sometimes they 
tried to rescue the cattle, which again bred strife and police-court 
summonses. 

Besides having a particular aversion to drovers, old M&apos;Gregor 
had a general &quot;down &quot;on the young &quot; colonials,&quot; whom he com- 
prehensively described as a &quot;feckless, horse-dealin&apos;, horse-stealin&apos;, 
crawlin&apos; lot o&apos; wretches.&quot; According to him, a native would 
sooner work a horse to death than work for a living, any 
day. He hated any man who wanted to sell him a horse. 
&quot; As ah walk the street,&quot; he used to say, &quot; the folk disna 
stawp me to buy claes nor shoon, an&apos; wheerfore should they 
stawp me to buy horrses ? It &apos;s &apos; Mister M&apos;Gregor, will ye 
purrchase a horrse ? &apos; Let them wait till I ask them to come wi* 
theer horrses.&quot; 

Such being his views on horseflesh and drovers, we felt no little 
excitement when one Sunday, at dinner, the cook came in to say 
that &quot;a drover-chap outside wants the boss to come and have 
a look at a horse.&quot; M&apos;Gregor simmered awhile, and muttered some- 
thing about the &quot; Sawbath day &quot;; but at last he went out, and we 
tiled after him to see the fun. 

The drover stood by the side of his horse, beneath the acacia 
trees in the yard. He had a big scar on his face, apparently the 
result of a collision with a tree ; and seemed poverty-stricken 
enough to disarm hostility. Obviously, he was &quot;down on his luck.&quot; 
He looked very thin and sickly, with clothes ragged and boots 
broken. Had it not been for that indefinable self-reliant look which 
drovers — the Ishmaels of the bush — always acquire, one might have 
taken him for a swagman. His horse was in much the same plight. 
A ragged, unkempt pony, pitifully poor and very footsore — at first 
sight, an absolute &quot;moke,&quot; but a second glance showed colossal 
round ribs, square hips, and a great length of rein, the rest hidden 



220 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

beneath a wealth of loose hair. He looked like &quot; a good journey 
horse,&quot; possibly something better. 

We gathered round while M&apos;Gregor questioned the drover. 
The man was monosyllabic to a degree, as real bushmen generally 
are. It is only the rowdy and the town-bushy that are fluent of 
speech. 

&quot; Good morrning,&quot; said M&apos;Gregor. 

*&apos; Mornin&apos;, boss,&quot; said the drover, shortly. 

&quot; Is this the horrse ye have for sale ? &quot; 

« Yes.&quot; 

&quot; Aye,&quot; and M&apos;Gregor looked at the pony with a business-like 
don&apos;t-think-much-of-him air ; ran his hand lightly over the hard legs, 
and opened the passive creature&apos;s mouth. &quot;H&apos;m,&quot; he said. Then 
he turned to the drover. &quot; Ye seem a bit oot o&apos; luck. Ye &apos;re thin 
like. What &apos;s been the matter ? &quot; 

&quot; Been sick with fever — Queensland fever. Just come through 
from the North. Been out on the Diamantina last.&quot; 

&quot;Aye. I was there mysel&apos;,&quot; said M&apos;Gregor. &quot;Have ye the 
fever on ye still?&quot; 

&quot; Yes — goin&apos; home to get rid of it.&quot; 

It should be explained that a man can only get Queensland 
fever in a malarial district, but he can carry it with him wherever 
he goes. If he stays, it will sap all his strength and pull him to 
pieces ; if he moves to a better climate, the malady moves with him, 
leaving him only by degrees, and coming back at regular intervals 
to rack, shake, burn, and sweat its victim. Queensland fever will 
pull a man down from fifteen stone to nine stone faster, and with 
greater certainty, than any system of dosing yet invented. Gradually 
it wears itself out, often wearing its patient out at the same time. 
M&apos;Gregor had been through the experience, and there wtis a slight 
change in his voice as he went on with the palaver. 

&quot; Where are ye makin&apos; for the noo? &quot; 

&quot; Monaro — my people live in Monaro.&quot; 

&quot; How will ye get to Monaro if ye sell the horrse ? &quot; 

&quot; Coach and rail. Too sick to care about ridin&apos;,&quot; said the 



WHITE- WHEN-HE &apos;S- WANTED. 221 

drover, while a wan smile flitted over his yellow-grey features. 
&quot; I &apos;ve rode him far enough. I &apos;ve rode that horse a thousand miles 
I would n&apos;t sell him, only I &apos;m a bit hard up^ Sellin&apos; him now to 
get the money to go home.&quot; 

&quot; How old is he ? &quot; 

&quot; Seven.&quot; 

&quot; Is he a good horse on a camp ? &quot; asked M&apos;Gregor. 

&quot; No better camp horse in Queensland,&quot; said the drover. &quot; You 
can chuck the reins on his neck, an&apos; he &apos;11 cut out a beast by 
himself.&quot; 

M&apos;Gregor&apos;s action in this matter puzzled us. We spent our 
time crawling after sheep, and a camp horse would be about as much 
use to us as side-pockets to a pig. We had expected Sandy to rush 
the fellow off the place at once, and we could n&apos;t understand how it 
was that he took so much interest in him. Perhaps the fever-racked 
drover and the old camp horse appealed to him in a way to us 
incomprehensible. We had never been on the Queensland cattle- 
camps, nor shaken and shivered with the fever, nor lived the roving 
life of the overlanders. M&apos;Gregor had done all this, and his heart 
(I can see it all now) went out to the man who brought the old days 
back to him. 

&quot; Ah, weel,&quot; he said, &quot; we ha&apos;e na much use for a camp horrse 
here, ye ken ; wi&apos;oot some of these lads wad like to try theer han&apos; 
cuttin&apos; oot the milkers&apos; cawves frae their mithers.&quot; And the old 
man laughed contemptuously, while we felt humbled and depraved 
in the eyes of the man from far back. &quot; An&apos; what &apos;11 ye be wantin&apos; 
for him ? &quot; asked M&apos;Gregor. 

&quot;Reckon he&apos;s worth fifteen notes,&quot; said the drover. 

This fairly staggered us. Our estimates had varied between 
thirty shillings and a fiver. We thought the negotiations would 
close abruptly ; but M&apos;Gregor, after a little more examination, agreed 
to give the price, provided the saddle and bridle, both grand 
specimens of ancient art, were given in. This was agreed to, and 
the driver was sent off to get his meals in the hut before leaving by 
the coach. 



222 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot;The mon is verra hard-up, an&apos; it&apos;s a sair thing that 

Queensland fever,&quot; — was the only remark that M&apos;Gregor made. 

But we knew that there was a soft spot in his heart some- 
where. 

And so, next morning, the drover got a crisp-looking cheque, 
and departed by coach. He said no word while the cheque was 
being written ; but as he was going away the horse happened to be 
in the yard, and he went over to the old comrade that had carried 
him so many miles, and laid a hand on his neck. &quot; He ain&apos;t much 
to look at,&quot; said the drover, speaking slowly and awkwardly, &quot;but 
he &apos;s white when he &apos;s wanted.&quot; And just before the coach rattled 
off, the man of few words leant down from the box and nodded 
impressively, &quot; Yes, he &apos;s white when he &apos;s wanted.&quot; 

We didn&apos;t trouble to give the new horse a name. Station 
horses are generally called after the man from whom they are 
bought. &quot;Tom Devine,&quot; &quot;The Regan mare,&quot; &quot;Black M&apos;Carthy,&quot; 
and &quot; Bay M&apos;Carthy &quot; were amongst the appellations of our horses 
at that time. As we did n&apos;t know the drover&apos;s name, we simply 
called the animal &quot; The new horse &quot; until a still newer horse was one 
day acquired. Then, one of the hands being told to take the new 
horse, said, &quot; D&apos; yer mean the new new horse, or the old new 
horse?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the boss, &quot;not the new horse — that bay 
horse we bought from the drover. The one he said was white when 
he was wanted.&quot; 

And so, by degrees, the animal came to be referred to as the 
horse that &apos;s white when he &apos;s wanted, and at last settled down to 
the definite name of &quot; White- when-he&apos;s- wan ted.&quot; 

White-when-he &apos;s-wanted did n&apos;t seem much of an acquisition. 
He was sent out to do slavery for Greenhide Billy, a boundary-rider 
who plumed himself on having once been a cattle-man. After a 
week&apos;s experience of &quot; White,&quot; Billy came in to the homestead 
disgusted — the pony was so lazy that he had to build a fire under 
him to get him to move, and so rough that it would make a man&apos;s 



WHITE- WHEN-HE &apos;S- WANTED. 223 

nose bleed to ride him more than a mile. &quot; The boss must have been 
off his head to give fifteen notes for such a cow.&quot; 

M&apos;Gregor heard this complaint. &quot; Verra weel, Mr. Billy,&quot; said 
he, hotly, &quot; ye can just tak&apos; one of the young horrses in yon paddock, 
An&apos; if he bucks wi&apos; ye, an&apos; kills ye, it &apos;s yer ain fault. Ye &apos;re a cattle- 
man — so ye say — dommed if ah believe it. Ah believe ye &apos;re a 
■dairy-farmin&apos; body frae Illawarra. Ye don&apos;t know neither horrse 
nor cattle. Mony &apos;s the time ye never rode buck-jumpers, Mr. 
Billy ! &quot; — and with this parting shot the old man turned into the 
bouse, and White-when-he &apos;s-wanted came back to the head station. 

For a while he was a sort of pariah. He used to yard the 
horses, fetch up the cows, and hunt travelling sheep through the 
run. He really was lazy and rough ; and we all decided that Billy&apos;s 
opinion of him was correct, until the day came to make one of our 
periodical raids on the wild horses in the hills at the back of the 
run. Every now and again we formed parties to run-in some of 
these animals ; and, after nearly galloping to death half-a-dozen good 
horses, we would capture three or four brumbies, and bring them in 
triumph to the homestead. These we would break-in ; and, by the 
time they had thrown half the crack riders on the station, broken 
all the bridles, rolled on all the saddles, and kicked all the dogs, 
they would be marketable (and no great bargains) at about thirty 
shillings a head. 

Yet there is no sport in the world to be mentioned in the same 
volume as &quot; running horses &quot;; and we were very keen on it. All the&lt;;rack nags were got as fit as possible, and fed-up beforehand ; and on 
this particular occasion White-when-he &apos;s-wanted, being in good 
trim, was given a week&apos;s hard-feed and lent to a harum-scarum 
fellow from the Upper Murray, who happened to be working in a 
survey-camp on the run. How he did open our eyes ! He ran the 
mob from hill to hill, from range to range, across open country and 
back again to the hills, over flats and gullies, through hop-scrub and 
stringybark ridges ; and all the time White-when-he &apos;s-wanted was 
on the wing of the mob, pulling double. The mares and foals 
-dropped out ; then the colts and young stock pulled up deadbeat ; 



224 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

and only the seasoned veterans of the mob were left. Most of our 
horses caved in altogether ; one or two were kept in the hunt by- 
judicious nursing and shirking the work, but White-when-he &apos;s- 
wanted was with the quarry from end to end of the run, doing 
double his share ; and at the finish, when a chance offered to wheel 
them into the trapyard, he simply smothered them for pace, and 
slewed them into the wings before they knew where they were^ 
Such a capture had not fallen to our lot for many a day^ 
and the fame of White-when-he &apos;s-wanted was speedily noised&apos;&apos; 
abroad. 

He was always fit for work, always hungry, always ready to- 
lie down and roll, and always lazy. But when he heard the rush of 
the brumbies&apos; feet in the scrub, he became frantic with excitement. 
He could race over the roughest ground without misplacing a hoof 
or altering his stride, and he could sail over fallen timber and across^ 
gullies like a kangaroo. Nearly every Sunday we were after the 
brumbies, until they got as lean as greyhounds and as cunning as 
policemen. We were always ready to back White-when-he &apos;s-wanted 
to run-down, single-handed, any animal in the bush that we liked to- 
put him after — wild horses, wild cattle, kangaroos, emus, dingoes, 
kangaroo-rats — we barred nothing, for, if he could n&apos;t beat them for 
pace, he would outlast them. 

And then one day he disappeared from the paddock, and we- 
never saw him again. We knew there were plenty of men in the 
district who would steal him ; but, as we knew also that there were 
plenty more who would &quot; inform &quot; for a pound or two, we were sure 
that it could not have been the local &quot; talent &quot; who had taken him. 
We offered good rewards and set some of the right sort to work ; but 
we heard nothing of him for about a year. 

Then the surveyor&apos;s assistant turned up again, after a trip to- 
the interior. He told us the usual string of backblock lies, and 
wound-up by saying that out on the very fringe of settlement 
he had met an old acquaintance. 

&quot; Who was that ? &quot; 



WHITE- WHEN-HE &apos;S-WANTED. 225 

&quot; Why, that little bay horse that I rode after the brumbies 
that time. The one you called White-when-he &apos;s-wanted &quot; 

&quot; The deuce you did ! Are you sure ? Who had him ? &quot; 

&quot; Sure ! I &apos;d swear to him anywhere. A little drover-fellow 
had him. A little fellow, with a big scar across his forehead. 
Came from Monaro way, somewhere. He said he bought the horse 
from you for fifteen notes.&quot; 

And then there was a chorus about the thief getting seven 
years. 

But he has n&apos;t so far, and, as the Queen&apos;s warrant does n&apos;t run 
much out west of Boulia, it is not at all likely that any of us will 
ever see the drover again, or will ever again cross the back of 
*&apos; White-when-he &apos;s-wanted.&apos;*

THE TRAMP. 

SHE laid the stick and her baby on the grass while she untied 
the rope that tethered the calf. The length of the rope 
separated them. The cow was near the calf, and both were 
lying down. Every day she found a fresh place to tether it — since 
tether it she must, for there was no one to go after it but herself. 
She had plenty of time, but then there was baby ; and if the cow 

turned on her out on the plains, and she with baby She was 

afraid of the cow ; she had been a town girl, only she did not want 
the cow to know it. She used to run at first when the cow bellowed 
its protest against the penning-up of its calf. This suited the cow, 
also the calf, but the woman&apos;s husband was wroth, and called her — 
the noun was cur It was he who forced her to run and meet the 
advancing cow, brandishing a stick and uttering threatening words 
till the enemy turned tail and ran &quot; That &apos;s the way ! &quot; the man 
said, laughing at her white face. In many things he was worse 
than the cow, and she wondered if the same rule would apply to the 
man, but she was not one to provoke skirmishes, even with the cow. 
It was early for the calf to go &quot; to bed &quot; — nearly an hour 
earlier than usual ; but she felt so weirdly lonely. Partly because 
it was Monday, and her husband had been home for Saturday night 
and Sunday. He had gone off before daylight this morning ; he 
was a shearer, and fifteen miles as the crow flies separated them. 
She knew of no one nearer, unless the tramp. Ah ! that was why 
she had penned the calf up so early. She feared more from the 
look of his eyes, and the gleam of his teeth, as he watched her 
newly-awakened baby beat its impatient fists upon her covered 
breasts, than from the knife that was sheathed in the belt at 
his waist. 



THE TRAMP. 227 

Her husband, she had told him, was sick. She always said 
that when she was alone and a tramp came — and she had gone in 
from the kitchen to the bedroom and asked questions and replied to 
them in the best man&apos;s voice she could assume. But this tramp had 
walked round and round the house, and there were cracks in some 
places, — and after the last time he had asked for tobacco. She had 
none to give, and he had grinned, because there was a broken clay 
pipe near the wood-heap where he stood, and if there were a man 
inside there ought to have been tobacco. Then he asked for money, 
but women in the bush never have money. 

At last he was gone, and she, watching through the cracks 
inside, saw him when about a quarter of a mile away turn and look 
back at the house. Then he went further in the direction that she 
would have him go ; but he paused again, turned and looked behind 
him, and, apparently satisfied, moved to the left towards the creek. 
The creek made a bow round the house, and when he came to it she 
lost sight of him. Hours after, watching intently in that direction 
for signs of smoke, she saw the man&apos;s dog chasing some sheep that 
had gone to the creek for water, and saw it slink back suddenly, as 
if the man had called it. 

More tlian once she thought of taking her baby and going to 
her husband, but as yet she had not set her will against his as with 
the cow, and so dared not. Long before nightfall she placed food 
in the kitchen, and a big brooch that had been her mother&apos;s she put 
upon the table, because, if the man did come back and robbery were 
his object, it was the only thing valuable that she had. And she 
left the kitchen door open — wide open ; but this was not wise. 

How she fastened the doors inside ! Beside the bolt in the 
back one she drove in the steel and the scissors ; against it she piled 
the stools and the table. Beside the lock on the front door she 
forced the handle of the spade, under the middle bar, and the blade 
between the cracks in the flooring boards. Then the prop-stick, cut 
into lengths, held the top as the spade held the middle. The 
windows were little more than port-holes ; she had nothing to fear 
through them. 



228 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

She ate a few mouthfuls of food and drank a cup of cold milk^ 
for she lighted no fire, and when night came no candle, but crept 
with her baby to bed. 

What woke her ? The wonder was that she had slept : she had 
not meant to, but she was young, very young. Perhaps the 
shrinking of the galvanised roof — yet hardly, that was too usual. 
Something had set her heart beating wildly, and the very air she 
breathed seemed fraught with terrible danger, but she lay quite 
still — only she put her other arm over her baby. Then she had both 
round it, and she prayed : &quot; Little baby — little baby — don&apos;t wake ! &apos;* 

She saw one of the open cracks, quite close to where she lay, 
darken with a shadow — for the moon&apos;s rays shone on that side. 
Then a protesting growl reached her; and she could fancy she 
heard the man turn hastily : she plainly heard the thud of some- 
thing striking the dog&apos;s ribs, and the long, flying strides of the 
animal as it howled and ran. Still watching, she saw the shadow 
darken every crack along the wall : she knew by the sounds that 
the man was trying every position that might help him to see in ; 
but how much he saw she could not tell. She thought of doing 
many things that might deceive him into the idea that she was not 
alone, but the sound of her voice would wake baby, and, as though 
that were the only danger that threatened her, she dreaded it. If 
baby cried she felt as if she, in turn, must betray her weakness, and 
instinctively cry to her protector, fifteen miles away. So she prayed : 
&quot; Little baby, don&apos;t wake ! don&apos;t cry ! &quot; 

Very stealthily the man crept about. She knew he had his 
boots off, because of the vibration that his feet caused as he walked 
along the verandah, gauging the width of the little window in 
her room and the resistance of the front door. Then he went to the 
other end, and the uncertainty of what he might be doing was fear- 
ful : she had felt safer, far safer, while he was close, and she could 
watch and listen. But now ! Oh, God ! it was terrible. She felt 
she must watch, and again the great fear of wakening baby assailed 
her. And there was another thing : on that side of the house one 



THE TRAMP. 229 

of the slabs had shrunk in length as well as in width, and had once 
fallen out. It was held in position only by a wedge of wood under- 
neath. What if he should diecover that ! The uncertainty increased 
her terror. She felt she must rise : and now, how she prayed as 
she gently raised herself with her litUe one in her arms, held tightly 
to her breast ! 

The vital parts in her child&apos;s body she tried to shield with her 
hands and arms as she thought of the knife : even its little feet she 
covered with its white gown, and baby never murmured — it liked 
to be held so. Noiselessly she crossed to the other side, and stood 
where she could see and hear, but not be seen. He was trying every 
slab, and was very near to that with the wedge under it. Then, 
even while hoping, she saw him find it ; and heard the sound of the 
knife as bit by bit he began to cut away the wooden barrier. 

She waited still, with her baby pressed tightly to her ; though 
she knew that in another few minutes this man with the cruel eyes, 
lascivious mouth and gleaming knife would be able to enter. One 
side of the slab tilted ; there was nothing to do now but cut away 
the remaining little end, when the slab, unless he held it, would fall 
inside or out ; and then 

She heard his jerked breathing as it kept time with the cuts of 
the knife, and heard the brush of his clothes as they rubbed the 
walls with his movements, for she was so still and quiet that she did 
not even tremble. And she knew when he ceased, and wondered 
why. She stood well concealed ; she knew he could not see her and 
that he would not fear if he did ; yet she heard him move cautiously 
away. Perhaps he expected the slab to fall. Still, his motive 
puzzled her : his retreat was a pretence, she felt sure ; and she 
moved even closer and bent her body the better to listen. Ah ! 
what sound was that ? &quot; Listen ! Listen ! &quot; she bade her heart — her 
heart that had kept so still hitherto, but now bounded with 
tumultuous throbs that dulled her ears. Nearer and nearer came 
the sounds, till the welcome thud of horse&apos;s hoofs rang out clearly. 

&quot; Oh, God ! Oh, God ! Oh, God ! &quot; she cried ; for they were 
very close before she could make sure, and then there was the door 



230 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

SO locked and barred with many bars. The age it took to tear awajr 
its fastenings ! 

Out she darted at last, and, tearing madly along, saw the horse- 
man far beyond her in the distance. She called to him in Christ&apos;s 
name, in her babe&apos;s name, still flying like the wind with the speed 
that deadly peril sends ; but the distance grew greater and greater 
between them, and when she reached the creek her prayers turned 
to wild shrieks, for there crouched the man she feared, with out- 
stretched hands that had caught her ere she saw him. She knew he 
was offering terms if she ceased to struggle and cry for help, though 
louder and louder did she cry for it ; but it was only when the man&apos;s 
hand gripped her throat that the cry of &quot; Murder ! &quot; came from her 
lips; and when she fell the startled curlews took up the awful 
sound, and flew over the horseman&apos;s head shrieking &quot; M-u-r-d-e-r ! 
M-u-r-d-e-r ! M-u-r-d-e-r!&quot; 

&quot; By God ! &quot; said the boundary-rider, &quot; it &apos;s been a dingo right 
enough. Eight killed up here, and there &apos;s more down in the creek 
— a ewe and lamb, I &apos;11 bet ; and the lamb &apos;s alive.&quot; And he shut 
out the sky with his hand and watched the crows that were circling 
round and round, nearing the earth one moment and the next 
shooting skyward. By that he knew the lamb must be alive. Even 
a dingo will spare a lamb sometimes. 

Yes, the lamb was alive, and after the manner of lambs of its- 
age did not know its mother when the light came. It had sucked 
the still-warm breasts and laid its little head on her bosom and 
slept till morn ; then, when the wee one looked at the swollen, 
disfigured face with the starting eyes, and clenched teeth that had 
bitten through the tongue and stained the bodice crimson, it wept 
and would have crept away but for the hand that still clutched it* 
little gown. Sleep was nodding its golden head and swaying ita 
small body, and the crows were close, so close, to the other&apos;s wide- 
open eyes, when the boundary-rider galloped down. He reeled in 
his saddle when he saw the two, and, covering his eyes, cried, 
*&apos; Jesus Christ ! &quot; And he told afterwards how the little child held 



THE TRAMP. 231 

out its arms to him, and how he was forced to cut the portion of its 
gown that the dead hand held. 

A few miles further down the creek a man kept throwing an 
old cap into the water. The dog would bring it out and lay it on 
the opposite side from where the man stood, but would not allow 
the man to catch him, though it was only to wash the blood of the 
sheep from his mouth and throat, for the sight of blood made the 
man tremble. 

But the dog also was guilty.

H 



THE MAN WHO SAW A MOA. 

IT had rained steadily for three days, and all hands were gathered 
round the cook-house lire — the only decently-dry place in camp. 

Dead sick we were of loafing and playing euchre for matches. 
Talk turned upon a recent discovery of moa-bones down south, and, 
of course, old Dick took the lead. There was n&apos;t a mortal thing on 
earth that he did n&apos;t know something about. He had been sailor, 
miner, soldier, bushman, and the Lord knows what else ; and, 
though he was past sixty, he could handle a hook or a flail with the 
best of us. 

&quot; Yes, mates, it can&apos;t have been very long since the last moa 
turned up its toes. In fact, I could spin a yarn &apos;bout that very 
same bird, only I don&apos;t care to be thought a liar by any man.&quot; 

&quot; Let her go, Gallagher ! let her go ! &quot; was the chorus all round. 

&quot; We &apos;d believe you, Dick,&quot; added a Taranaki man, &quot; if you 
told us you had shorn Esau, the hairy man, and sold his fleece to 
St. Peter for a door-mat.&quot; 

&quot; Came out here,&quot; went an Diqk witfiout more ado, &quot; in the 

early days, when the West Coast Was just beginning to boom. Self 
and mate cleared out from the barque we were on at Lyttleton, and 
made &apos;cross country to the Coast. We had a pretty rough time at 
first, and went back past all the other diggers, after a bit, and 
camped in the bottom of a big gorge. Here we made very fair 
money, even for those days, although we were pretty lonesome all 
by ourselves. First night or two we got devilish well scared. Just 
about dark there would come a wild, wailin&apos; sort o&apos; noise, something 
like a steam-siren in a fog. But, as nothin&apos; happened, we soon got 
used to that ; in fact, we used it as a kind o&apos; tea-bell. 

&quot; However, one day we was workin&apos; on a bit of terrace at the

bottom of the gorge, when a boulder, the size of a man&apos;s head, came 
out of the bush above us as if it had been fired from a cannon ; then&lt;;ame two or three more, and then a six-foot log, and we reckoned it 
was n&apos;t healthy where little things like that were flyin&apos; round, so we 
knocked off and went up to see what the trouble was. We climbed 
up to a little terrace &apos;bout fifty yards above us, and there was the 
chap that had done it ! — a thunderin&apos; big bird, &apos;bout twice the size 
of an ostrich. He was scratching for dear life, just like a rooster. 
An&apos; every now an&apos; again he would pick up a worm or a grub. &apos; Poor 
beggar ! &apos; says Jack ; * if he has to load-up with that sort o&apos; tack 
he &apos;11 be a long time gettin&apos; his full cargo on board. &apos; 

&quot;We looked at him and he looked at us, and just went on 
scratching again ; go we concluded to let well alone. 

&quot; After that we often used to meet the beggar stalking about 
the river-bed or in the bush ; in fact, he seemed to like to see us. 
S&apos;pose he felt a bit lonely with none of his mates about. What was 
he like ? Well, not unlike one of them wood-hens you see running 
About, only about a thousand times as big. He had little bits of 
wings, an&apos; a funny little tail that he stuck up in a comical way, every 
step he took. Run ! — by the hokey, he could run ! Saw him 
■chasing a Maori-rat one day, and the rat had n&apos;t a show. Our 
friend just put down his head and went through the scrub and 
supple-jacks like greased lightnin&apos;. 

&quot; At last one night the beggar paid us a visit in camp, just as 
we were sitting down to tea. S&apos;pose the grubs and worms had been 
A bit scarce that day, for he seemed pretty sharp set. Jack threw 
him half a roast pigeon ; he swallowed it like a pea, and then the 
iun began. He walked right up to the tent-door, and began to 
tackle the rest of the grub. Jack up and hit him with a pick- 
handle, but the bloomin&apos; dicky-bird just planted his foot in Jack&apos;s&lt;jhest, and Jack sat down mighty quick. Then I chimed in with a 
tomahawk, but he just let me have one-two in such short order that 
I thought I might as well have a spell, too. He was a good doer, 
and no mistake ! Scoffed our pigeons whole, choked over the 
damper, swallowed a knife, an&apos; then he put his beak in the hot tea. 



234 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Pulls it back pretty sudden, you bet ! but when Jack gives a chuckle 
and raises his head a bit where he is lyin&apos;, the old fowl just steps 
over to him and dances all the grinnin&apos; out of him in two jiflfs. Back 
he goes, then, and starts to turn out the whole bloomin&apos; caboose. 
Finding the tent a bit awkward for a bird of his size, he just kicks 
it to Jericho an&apos; starts scratchin&apos; like a steam-engine. My word ! the^ 
way those things did fly ! He found my watch and swallowed it, 
leavin&apos; the chain hangin&apos; out of his beak. Then he got on to some 
tinned stuff, an&apos; down went the two-pound tins like pills. But 
drink was his ruin — like many another&apos;s ! 

&quot; We had some rum in the bottom of a long tin-can, and when 
he shoved his beak into this I suppose he found it pretty good ; at 
all events he was n&apos;t in a hurry to take his beak out again. When 
he did try to get out, the handle of the tin stuck round his neck, and 
there he was blindfolded. Things began to fly worse than ever then ; 
he went dancing round into the fire and up again&apos; the trees till he 
found it would n&apos;t come off that way, so he quietened down — put 
the tin on the ground, and started working it off gradually. This 
was our chance ! I ups with the tomahawk and takes the can fairly 
off for him ; of course it was n&apos;t my fault that his head came with it ! 

&quot; Well, boys, we lived on that bird for nearly a month ; he was 

something like turkey, with a dash of shag. Yes; we got the 

tinned-meat and the watch out all right ; likewise about fifty quid 

worth of rough gold that the beggar had stowed away. Why didn&apos;t 

we take the carcase into town ? Because we were new-chums, my 

lad, an&apos; didn&apos;t know but moas was as common as cock-a-doodles. &quot;

FROM THE LOG OF THE OUTWARD BOUND. 

THE look-out had sighted some wreckage on the lee-quarter; 
the mate, aloft, had made out a ship&apos;s mast in the centre of 
the circular vista his binocular gave him ; and the steamer&apos;s 
head fell off three points to leeward so as to pass closer. The stale 
novels and quoits, the staler flirtations, were dropped, and all the 
passengers crowded to the side ; except the half-dozen men in the 
smoking-room, who still kept to their eternal poker. The rest 
waited, glancing alternately from the sea to the cross-trees, and 
looking where pointed the black barrels of the mate&apos;s glasses. 

&quot; There &apos;s a man lashed to it ! &quot; 

The cry from aloft sent a thrill of excitement all through the 
steamer. Down to the sick people, who tried to come on deck, or 
at least rolled over in their bunks to open their dead-lights ; down 
to the engineers, reaching with oil-cans between flying piston-rods ; 
down ptist the grimy, sweating devils in the stokehole, till it got 
into the coal, mingled with the steam, and flew through the pipes 
and valves like spirit through the veins of a man. But the poker- 
players remained calm. 

&quot;Tell us when we come up,&quot; said one who held four aces. 
** Raise you five pounds ! &quot; 
IP The smoke tumbled from the funnels with a hoarse roar ; the 
minutes seemed as many as the countless waves that one by one 
dashed against the bow, and fell by, broken and shattered, into the 
hissing wake. Then the spar was sighted from the deck ; bit by 
bit the details became plainer, — the top, the dishevelled rigging, and 
something else — a mere spot — which gradually grew into the bare 
breast of a man, in blue trousers, lashed with many coils to the 
mast. 



236 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Steam was stopped and a boat lowered. There was no sign of 
life from the castaway ; he hung forward limply on his lashings, and 
he seemed fearfully wasted. Coming closer, a slight movement of 
his head was seen, but it was only the rocking of the sea, and it 
added to his helpless, dead appearance. Rough hands grew womanly 
as they cut him loose and laid him in the stern. Then the boat 
shot back to the steamer, whose black sides were spotted with little 
white specks along the bulwarks and at every cabin-window. 

&quot;Living — just ! &quot; said the doctor, from the sheets, as the boat 
touched the side. There was a cheer, in which even the poker- 
players joined, with their hands in their pockets clutching the last 
deal. 

Then the fearfully light armful was lifted on board, and left to 
the doctor forward ; the steamer was put on her course ; and the 
forlorn spar, with its tangle of rigging, was soon bobbing away in 
the white wake that she trailed behind her half-way round the 
world. 

The passengers would have liked the man to relate his 
adventures, but no one had seen him except the doctor, whose 
bulletin said that he was very weak, hardly sensible, and an almost 
hopeless case. On the evening of the third day, when the subject — 
considered as a topic for the saloon — had so waned in interest that 
bets were no longer made as to the patient&apos;s living or not, the doctor 
came to the captain. 

&quot; He &apos;s sensible now, and he wants to see you — to make a 
statement, he says.&quot; 

« Is he ? &quot; 

&quot; Umph — yes ! I &apos;m afraid so.&quot; 

They went forward to the sick bay, where the lamps, switched 
low, showed a man lying back, with sunken temples, and cheeks 
gaunt and hollow under the new beard that half-covered them. He 
turned a glance, glittering with death, upon the comers, and spoke 
in a struggling whisper. 

&quot; Skipper, my clearance is made out. I want my wife to know 
at once that I am dead — you &apos;re a liner, ain&apos;t you — that &apos;s good ! the 



fliOM THE LOG OF THE OUTWARD BOUND. 237 

news &apos;11 be quicker. I don&apos;t want no &apos; raissin&apos; at Lloyd&apos;s,&apos; and 
waitin&apos; and waitin&apos; month arter month for me to turn up. &apos;T ain&apos;t 
good for a woman, &apos;specially when — oh ! it &apos;s mighty hard, skipper ! 
— we was only just married, but it &apos;s better she knows at once — the 
oncertainty &apos;d kill her, and she &apos;11 be able to bear it better now than 
— than if it come on her by-and-by. Tell her immediate, skipper ; 
and tell the owners that the Laura May has foundered, so Jenny 
can get my wages ; she &apos;11 want it, poor girl.&quot; 

The captain assured him, and he went on : 

&quot;My name &apos;s Trigg — Benjamin Trigg, A.B., of the Laura May, 
barquentine, of Liverpool, homeward bound from Port Royal with 
logwood — fifteen souls, all told — all gone but me ! . . . God 
Almighty ! there they are again ! Keep &apos;em off ! Keep &apos;em off ! &quot; 

It was only a cockroach that had dropped on the blanket, but 
he had risen on one elbow with the miraculous strength of delirium, 
and his whole frame trembled with horror. 

&quot; Not like that ! Oh, God ! don&apos;t kill me like poor Joe ! No, 
no, God ! &quot; 

Ho seemed to sweep something off his face, and fell back 
suddenly in collapse. The doctor flicked the insect away. 

&quot; Gone ? &quot; asked the captain. 

&quot; Yes.&quot; 

&quot; Poor devil ! What did he mean ? Sounded like the horrors, 
didn&apos;t it?&quot; 

&quot;No, it can&apos;t be that— it&apos;s very peculiar— the sun has got at 
his brain.&quot; 

&quot; You &apos;re— right— doctor— it ain&apos;t.&quot; The man&apos;s eyes were still 
closed, but his lips parted in an almost inaudible whisper. 

&quot; Alive ! &quot; started the two listeners. 

&quot; Ay — I &apos;m alive — summat, and it ain&apos;t the &apos;orrors. They ain&apos;t 
so bad as hanging over that deck hearin&apos; Joe and watchin&apos; them 
crawlin&apos; things. You &apos;11 keep &apos;em off me, won&apos;t yer, doctor— you 
won&apos;t let me die like my poor messmate ? . . . Gimme something 
and I &apos;11 tell ye about it.&quot; 

The doctor, still perplexed, leant over the castaway, quietly

parting down the clasped, beseeching hands, and holding the brandy 
to the blackened lips. 

&quot; Thank ye — that &apos;s better — I &apos;11 get along — &apos;s nearly high 
water. It happened tenth day out. &quot;We &apos;d been becalmed three 
days, and it was the rollin&apos; about in the blazin&apos; sun with the sea 
lukewarm that did it. There was millions and millions of eggs in 
that blasted stuff, and the sun hatched &apos;em. . . . Skipper, what &apos;s 
your cargo ? &quot; 

* &apos; General merchandise. &apos; &apos; 

&quot;Any logwood? &quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; 

&quot; That &apos;s right. Steer clear of it. &apos;Cos when you &apos;re becalmed 
the sun hatches them things — never open the hatches when you &apos;re 
becalmed &quot; 

&quot; This is a steamer, my man,&quot; said the captain. 

&quot; I know — can&apos;t I hear yer engines — they &apos;re sayin&apos; I &apos;m dead, 
so Jenny &apos;11 get my wages. / &apos;m-dead-that-I-am-tkat-I-am-that-I-am 
— listen, skipper ! — / &apos;m dead — they speak quite plain — that-I-am- 
that-I-am-that 

&quot;Lord, old girl, who &apos;d &apos;a&apos; thought you &apos;d &apos;a&apos; made so much out 
o&apos; washin&apos; shirts — Mrs. Trigg, Laundress — I painted the same sort 
of curly L on the bows of the Laura May — don&apos;t pipe yer eye, I &apos;m 
home now, and I &apos;11 never sail on a logwood ship no more. Tighter, 
lass ! Lord, it &apos;s real lummy &apos;avin&apos; yer arms round me. Wha-at ! 
God&apos;s mercy ! yer don&apos;t say so ? Bless yer, lass — and him or 
her, whatever it is ! Mind, if it &apos;s a boy he &apos;s to be called 
Joe. Don&apos;t say nothin&apos; — I &apos;m too damned happy. . . . Laura 
May, sir, homeward bound. . . . Ay, ay, sir. . . . What the hell 
does the mate want, swabbin&apos; an&apos; polishin&apos; — &apos;tain&apos;t a bloomin&apos; 
yacht &quot; 

He went off into disconnected scraps of sentences, each in a 
different voice, and then into inarticulate mutterings. Even when 
he was silent the diseased activity of his brain was shown by the 
voiceless thought that ran in rapid changes of expression over his 
face. The two men tried hard to gather its import ; then the

captain whispered to the doctor, who shook his head doubtfully and 
said, &quot;I don&apos;t think it &apos;s any use.&quot; 

&quot;I do,&quot; said the captain. &quot;I &apos;ve seen it before; it &apos;11 bring 
him up with a round turn.&quot; 

Then in his quarter-deck voice he shouted, &quot; Ready about — 
stand by ! &quot; right in the sailor&apos;s ear, who at once ceased his vague 
muttering and answered, &quot;Ay, ay, sir ! &quot; 

&quot; See ! &quot; whispered the captain, &quot;look at his hands ! he &apos;s un- 
hitched the braces — all but a turn. Now we can lead him. Trigg ! &quot; 

&quot; Ay, ay, sir ! &quot; 

&quot; What happened when the Laura May was on the homeward 
voyage ? &quot; . 

The man went on in a low, weakening voice that at times died 
away to nothing, but each time he wandered the captain brought 
him back by a call to duty and a question. 

&quot; The skipper thought we &apos;d sprung a leak through strainin&apos; of 
the timbers, and he ordered us to take off the &apos;atches. I was for&apos;ard 
when I heard a scream — like a woman&apos;s — and I ran aft and saw 
everybody runnin&apos; away from the &apos;atches, &apos;cos the inside of the &apos;old 
was one infernal crawlin&apos; mass of insects — lizards, and scorpions, 
and centipedes, and beetles, and things I never before heard tell on, 
and millions and millions of ants, white and black and red, all 
hatched out of the logwood. And there was Joe Deebles, my mess- 
mate, dancin&apos; about howlin&apos;, &apos;cos one o&apos; them things had bit him. 
In half an eye we was racin&apos; aloft, &apos;cos the pesky things was 
spreadin&apos; fore and aft as if we had shipped a sea of &apos;em. We was 
real downright frightened, and all the time Joe was doublin&apos; up of 
himself in the maintop, and his leg was all blue and swollen like a 
poisoned pup. And the insects was tumblin&apos; out of the &apos;old like 
mad, and soon there was n&apos;t an inch clear of &apos;em. At first the mate 
tried to fight &apos;em with a mop on the poop, but some of the durned 
things could jump, and towards afternoon there was flyin&apos; things 
as well, with nasty red wings, buzzin&apos; above the deck. I was with 
Joe in the maintop, and the rest was scattered permiscus-like all over 
the riggin&apos;. We was all fearfully thirsty ; it was blazing hot, and 



240 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

all the while them leggy things was knottin&apos; and splicin&apos; of them- 
selves below. We was afraid they &apos;d come aloft, but when they 
sniffed the bulwarks, which was bubblin&apos; tar, they &apos;bouted ship back 
again. We saw the ants run up the railin&apos;s, and round the wheel 
and all over the spokes, all fightin&apos; and scruffin&apos;. They swarmed 
over the binnacle, and some long things slipped back on the eaves, 
and fell flat on the deck with their white bellies up, and their dozens 
o&apos; legs kickin&apos; in the air. And we heard a screech from Neil 
Hansen&apos;s parrot in the fo&apos;c&apos;s&apos;le, and we knew they &apos;d got at it. It 
was as much as we could do to stop Neil from goin&apos; down to save it. 
Then the skipper&apos;s fox-terrier began to sniff and yowl under the 
door, and the crawlers must &apos;ve got him, for we heard him snappin^ 
and howlin&apos; and dancin&apos; round till he, too, was quiet. We knew 
that the things &apos;d never be got out of the ship, and the skipper 
talked of burnin&apos; her. And there was a nasty insecty smell which 
was sickening ; it came mostly from the caboose, which was smokin&apos;, 
and it was mixed up with pea-soup. The things must &apos;ve fallen into 
the tire. And Joe was gettin&apos; weaker and weaker, and talkin&apos; of 
home, so we had to bind him to the ratlines. Now and again some- 
one &apos;d go aloft to the truck, but there was never nothin&apos; in sight. 
Then night came on, and the first few hours afore the moon rose- 
was awful up there in the dark with Joe dyin&apos;, and the creep, creep, 
creep of them things below. Every minute you&apos;d hear somebody 
startin&apos; o&apos; slappin&apos; hisself, as if he felt somethin&apos; crawlin up him. 
When the moon rose it was better, &apos;cos we could see each other, and 
the skipper started a song to liven us, sayin&apos; we was in the track of&quot; 
steamers, and we &apos;d sure to be sighted. All of a sudden Joe joined 
in the chorus, very loud, and afore a man could say * Avast &apos; he &apos;d 
broken loose his lashin&apos;s and jumped off the top. He went singin&apos; 
all the way down, till we heard him scrunch into the insects on. 
deck. We just see&apos;d his face for a minute, all white in the moon- 
light, and them cursed things closed over him, and he was only a 
heap of insects . . . was . . . my messmate and the parrot and 

the terrier &quot; 

&quot; Now, it &apos;s real downright ridiculous, Jenny, goin&apos; on like this ;

your &apos;usband did n&apos;t die like poor Joe, he did n&apos;t, marm. He had a 
berth in a liner, and a liner&apos;s doctor, and he was buried decently 
with a shot at his heels, and he told me to tell you, Mrs. Trigg, 
that he was very sick when Joe fell, and, says he, get my wages, 
Jenny dear, and call the baby Ben. Don&apos;t call him Joe, &apos;cos Joe 
fell among the insects, and next mornin&apos; all the crew was lashed 
aloft, &apos;cos they was frightened, too, and Trigg, marm, your poor 
&apos;usband, what died on the liner, he looked on deck and he see&apos;d a 
skeleton hand — picked clean 

&apos;* Will yer remember it all, skipper ? Write it down — Joe fell, 
and there was a squall, I think. I remember hearin&apos; &apos;im sing, and 
lashin&apos; myself to the mast, and the creepy sound came up through 
the timber, an&apos; 

&quot; Hallo, where &apos;s the moon ? — it &apos;s all cloudy, there &apos;s wind 
coming — in with the topsails — ay, ay, sir — if we ship a sea with the 
&apos;atches o£f we &apos;11 founder — what &apos;s that ! God ! here it comes broad- 
side on — hold tight &quot; 

&quot; Yer &apos;and, skipper ; I &apos;m castin&apos; off. Thanks for pickin&apos; me 
up — you went out of yer way — t&apos; other line &apos;11 beat yer this trip. 
&apos;T ain&apos;t every skipper would &apos;ve. I &apos;ve sailed on liners — all hell for 
the passage and damn those overboard ! Good-bye, doctor, and

ON OUR SELECTION. 

THE baby, twelve months old, was to be christened, and Mother 
decided to give a party. She had been thinking about the 
party for some time; but decision was contemporaneous 
with the arrival of a certain mysterious parcel, when we were 
told to prepare for the party in earnest. 

Dad and Dave were drawing water. Joe was raking husks and 
corn-cobs into a heap at the door and burning them. Little Bill 
was collecting the pumpkins and pie-melons strewn about th^^ yard. 
Mother and Sal were engaged outside. Mother stood on a box ; 
Sal spread newspapers on the table and smeared them over with 
paste, then handed them cautiously to mother, who fixed them on 
the wall. The baby crawled upon the floor. 

&quot;Not that way,&quot; said mother; &quot;that&apos;s upside-down; give 
them to me straight, &apos;cause your father sometimes likes to read them 
when they &apos;re up.&quot; 

They chatted about the christening. 

&quot;Indeed, then, she won&apos;t be asked,&quot; Sal said; &quot;not if she goes 
down on her knees — th&apos; skinny little &quot; 

&quot;Min&apos;j min&apos;, mind, girl ! &quot; Mother screeched ; and Sal dropped 
the newspaper she was about to hand up, and jumping a stool 
caught the baby by the skirt-tail just as it was about to wobble into 
the fire. 

&quot; My goodness ! you little rat ! &quot; The baby laughed playfully, 
and struggled to get out of her arms. Sal placed it at the opposite 
side of the room, and the decorating continued. 

&quot; I can remember the time, then,&quot; Mother said, &quot; when they 
had n&apos;t so much to be flash about ; when the old woman and 
that eldest girl, Johanna, used to go about in their bare feet 



ON OUR SELECTION, 243 

a,nd with dresses on — dear me ! — that I would n&apos;t give to a black- 
gin!&quot; 

&quot; Not Johanna, mother ! &quot; 

&quot;Yes, Johanna; you wouldn&apos;t remember it, of course; 
Norah was the baby then.&quot; 

&quot;You little wretch ! &quot; and Sal rushed for the baby and pulled 
it from the fire once more. She dumped it down in a different corner, 
and returned to the paste. The baby made eagerly for the fire 
again, but when half-way across the room it stopped, rested its 
cheek on the floor and fell asleep — and it on the verge of being 
christened &quot; Bartholomew ! &quot; — until Dad came in and took it up. 

Mother went into her bedroom and came out with a flaring red 
fiash flying over her greasy gown, and asked Dad if he liked it. 

Dad looked at the ribbon, then out of the window and chuckled. 

&quot;Whatd&apos;y&apos; thinkof me?&quot; 

&quot; Think of y&apos; ?&quot; — and Dad grinned. 

Mother looked fondly at the ribbon. She was very satisfied 
with herself. She was a true woman. She tripped into the room 
again and came out with some yards of print, and asked Dad what 
he thought of that. Mother was fond of dress. 

&quot; Dear me, woman ! &quot; Dad said ; &quot; what &apos;s going to happen? &apos;* 

&quot; But how do y&apos; like it ?&quot; — letting it hang like a skirt. 

Dad grinned more. 

&quot; Is it a nice pattern ? &quot; 

Dad still grinned. 

&quot; Does it suit me ? &quot; 

Dad looked out the window and saw Joe knock little Bill 
down with a pumpkin. He ran out. 

&quot; Men have n&apos;t a bit of taste,&quot; Mother said to Sal, folding the 
print, &quot;except just for what&quot; (Joe rushed in at the front &apos;door and 
out the back one) — &quot; &apos;cept for what &apos;s to go in their stomachs. All 
they think about &apos;s an old &quot; — (Dad rushed in at the front door 
and out the back one) — &quot; old horse or something ; and then they 
think &quot; — (Joe rushed in again at the front door, but dived under the 
sofa) — &quot; think every old screw is a race-horse &quot; — (Dad rushed in 



244 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

again at the front door and out at the back one) — &quot; my word ! if hf&gt;finds you there, me shaver, you &apos;11 catch it ! &quot; 

Joe breathed hard. 

Mother put the print away and mounted the box again. Then 
Mrs. Flannigan — a glib-tongued old gossip, the mother of sixteen 
shy selector children — dropped in, and they drank tea together and 
talked about christening and &quot; matches &quot; and marriages and babies 
and bad times and bad husbands until dark — until Mrs. Flannigan 
thought her husband would be wanting his supper, and went home. 

Joe talked of the christening at school. For a time nobody 
paid any attention to him ; but as days passed, and one and another 
went home to lind that mother and father and bigger brothers and 
sisters had been &quot; asked,&quot; the interest grew, and a revulsion of 
feeling in favour of Joe set in. First, Nell Anderson suddenly 
evinced a desire for his society — till then she would weep if made 
stand next him in class ; then the Murphys and the Browns and 
young Roberts surrounded him, and Reuben Burton put his string 
bridle on him, and would n&apos;t ride any other horse in a race ; and at 
last Joe became the idol of the institution. They all fawned on 
him and followed him about — all but the two Caseys. They were 
isolated, and seemed to feel their position keenly. 

Joe was besieged with questions, and he answered them 
with a head-shake and a sniffling of one nostril. He disclosed all 
the arrangements, and gave melting descriptions of the pies and 
puddings Mother was preparing. How they danced around him and 
called him &quot; Joseph &quot; ! The two Caseys stood off in silence, and in 
fancy saw those pies and puddings. A pleasant contemplation till 
Nell Anderson pointed to them, and asked Joe if they were invited. 

&quot; Nah,&quot; Joe said ; &quot;n-n-none of &apos;em is.&quot; 

&quot; Ain&apos;t their mother ? &quot; 

&quot; N-nah, we d-don&apos;t want &apos;em,&quot; — and he snuffled more. The two 
Caseys stole away to the rear of the school, where they sat and 
nursed their chagrin in lugubrious silence, and caught flies 
mechanically, and looked down at their bare feet over which the 



ON OUR SELECTION. 245 

ants crawled, until the teacher thumped the end of the little 
building with a huge paling, and school went in. 

The day came, and we all rose early and got ready. The 
parson, who had to ride twenty-five miles to be present, arrived 
near mid-day. His clothes were dusty, and he looked tired. Mother 
and Sal wondered if they should offer him something to eat, or let 
him wait until the guests arrived and all sat to the big spread. 
They called Dad and Dave into the little tumble-down kitchen to 
discuss the matter. Dad said he did n&apos;t care what they did ; but 
Dave settled it. He said : &quot; Get th&apos; chap a feed.&quot; 

Joe sat on the sofa beside the parson&apos;s tall hat and eyed it in 
wonder. Joe had never seen so much Respectability before. The 
parson ate with his back turned to Joe, while Mother and Sal flew 
busily about. Joe cautiously put out his hand to feel the beaver. 
Mother saw him and frowned. Joe withdrew his hand and stared 
at the rafters. 

&quot; Delicious tea ! &quot; said the parson, and Mother served him 
with more. 

Joe&apos;s hand stole out to the hat again. Dave, standing outside 
near the front door, noticed him and grinned. That emboldened Joe, 
and he lifted the hat and placed his head inside it, and grinned out 
at Dave. Mother frowned more, but Joe could n&apos;t see her. She 
hurried out. Then from the back of the house Dad&apos;s voice 
thundered &apos;* Joe I &quot; Joe removed the beaver and obeyed the call. 
Harsh, angry whispers came from the door, then sounds of a scuffle, 
and an empty bucket flew after Joe as he raced across the yard 
towards the haystack. 

Soon the guests began to arrive. The Maloneys and the Todds 
and the Taits and the Thompsons and others, with children and 
dogs, came in spring-carts and drays from Back Creek ; the WatsoT»s 
and the Whites and old Holmes and Judy Jubb, from Prosperity 
Peak, appeared on horseback. Judy, in the middle of the yard, 
stepped out of a torn and tattered old riding-habit, with traces of 
the cow-yard about it, and displayed a pair of big boots and 



246 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

** railway &quot; stockings, and a nide white muslin dress with red bows 
and geraniums and a lot of frills and things on it. Judy was very 
genteel. The Sylvesters — nice people that came from Brisbane with 
new ideas and settled near us ; people who could n&apos;t leg-rope a cow ; 
who were going to make a big thing out of fowls ; who were for ever 
asking Dad if jew-lizards were snakes — came on foot with their baby 
in a little painted cart. A large black dog, well-groomed and in 
new harness, without reins, pulled the cart along. We had never 
seen a dog pulling a cart before — neither had our dog. He rushed 
off to meet the Sylvesters, but stopped half-way and curled his tail 
over his back, and growled, and threw earth about with his legs^ 
Sylvesters&apos; dog stood also, and curled Ids tail over his back. Mrs. 
Sylvester patted him and said, &quot; Carlo — Carlo ! you naughty boy ! &quot;^ 
Our dog suddenly made off. Sylvesters&apos; dog pursued him. He tore 
along the fence at coursing speed, making a great noise with the 
cart until he turned a corner, where the cart upset and left the baby. 
But he didn&apos;t catch our dog. And Paddy Maloney and Steve 
Burton and young Wilkie galloped up through the paddock, shouting 
and whipping their horses, and carried away the clothes-line 
stretched between two trees at the back. 

The house soon filled — there was just room for big Mrs. M&apos;Doolan 
to squeeze in. She came on foot, puffing and blowing, and drank the 
glass of christening water that stood on the table with bull-frogs 
careering round in it. She shook hands with everybody she knew, 
and with everybody she did n&apos;t know, and kissed the baby. There 
was no pride about big Mrs. M&apos;Doolan. 

The ceremony was about to commence. Joe and the young 
Todds and the young Taits, who, with the tomahawk and some dogs 
— about twenty-six dogs — had been up the paddock hunting 
kangaroo-rats, returned with a live jew-lizard. They squatted round 
the door guarding the trophy. 

Dad and Mother, with the baby in a dress of rebellious hues, 
stood up and faced the parson. All became silent and expectant. 
The parson whispered something to mother, and she placed the baby 
in Dad&apos;s great arms. The band of hunters at the door giggled, and 




ON OUR SELECTION. 247 

the jew-lizard tried to escape. Dad, his hair and beard grown very 
long, stared at the parson with a look of wild, weird reverence 
about him. 

&quot;In the name of the Father,&quot; the parson drawled, dipping his 
fingers into the water and letting it drip on to the baby&apos;s face, &quot; I 
baptise thee, Barthol &quot; 

Interruption. 

The jew-lizard escaped, and with open mouth and head up raced 
across the floor. Had it been a boa-constrictor or a bunyip the 
women could n&apos;t have squealed with more enthusiasm. It made 
straight for Judy Jubb. But Judy had been chased by a jew-lizard 
before. She drew back her skirts — also her leg — and kicked the 
vermin in the chest and lifted it to the rafters. It fell behind the 
sofa and settled on Todd&apos;s bull-dog that was planted there. Bully 
seized it and shook it vigorously and threw it against Mrs. 
M&apos;Doolan, and seized it again and shook it more — shook it until our 
dog and a pack of others rushed in. &quot; T&apos; th&apos; devil ! &quot; said Dad, 
indignantly, aiming heavy kicks at the brutes. &quot; The child — gimme 
th&apos; child ! &quot; Mother shrieked, pulling at Dad. &quot;Out w&apos; y&apos; ! &quot; said 
Anderson, letting fly his foot. &quot; Doumiy Bully ! &quot; shouted Todd, and 
between them all they kicked the dogs right through the door, then 
heaved the lizard after them. 

But the ceremony was soon over, and everybody was radiant 
with joy — everybody but Bartholomew. He had been asleep until 
the parson dropped the water on his face, when he woke suddenly. 
He glared at the strange assemblage a moment, then whined and 
cried hard. Mother &quot; hooshed &quot; him, and danced him up and down 
saying, &quot; Did they /W-ten &apos;m ? &quot; Mrs. M&apos;Doolan took him and 
&quot; hooshed &quot; him and jumped him about and said : &quot; TJiere now — 
there now ! &quot; But Bartholomew resented it all, and squealed till it 
seemed some part of him must burst. Mrs. Todd and Mrs. Ander- 
son and Judy Jubb each had a go at him. &quot; Must have the wind,&quot; 
murmured Mrs. Ryan, feelingly, and Mrs. Johnson agreed with her 
by nodding her head. Mother took him again and showed him the 
dog, but he did n&apos;t care for dogs. Then Sal ran out with him and 



248 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

put him on **the gee-gee&quot; — Dad&apos;s old moke that stood buried in 
thought at the fence — and he was quiet. , 

A long table erected in the barn was laden with provisions, 
and Dad invited the company to &quot;come along and make a start.&quot; 
They crowded in and stared about. Green boughs and corn-cobs 
hung on the walls ; some bags of shelled corn stood in one corner ; 
and from a beam dangled a set of useless old cart-harness that Dad 
used to lend to anyone wanting to borrow. Dad and Paddy 
Maloney took up the carving. Dad stood at one end of the table — 
Paddy at the other. Both brandished long knives. Dad proceeded 
silently — Paddy with joyous volubility. &quot; Fowl or pig ? &quot; he shouted 
to them, and rattled the knife, and piled the provender on their 
plates, and told them to &quot; back in their carts &quot; when they wanted 
more; and he called the minister &quot;boss.&quot; Paddy was in his 
element. 

&apos;T was a magnificent feast, though, and went o£f most success- 
fully. It went off until only the ruins remained. Then the party 
returned to the house and danced. Through the afternoon, and 
far into the night, the concertina screeched its cracked refrain, 
while the forms of weary females, with muffled infants in arms, 
hovered about the drays in the yard, and dog-tired men, soatediio 
the knees with dew-wet grass, bailing and blocking horses in a 
paddock corner, took strange, shadowy shape, — until, when all was 
bright and the sun seemed near, the last dray rolled heavily away 
from the christening of Bartholomew.

A BOX OF DEAD ROSES. 

THE old lady was a most amusing creature, and she had a past 
which was a record amongst pasts. Only that she was rich 
enough to buy the whole district, its &quot; society &quot; would have 
&quot;&quot; cut &quot; her long ago ; as it was, people only talked about her with 
meaning looks and whispered condemnation. At least, the generation 
to which she belonged did that ; the younger one only looked and 
wondered. Bent with rlieumatism, bushy-browed, fierce-eyed and 
hard-featured — there remained no trace of the beauty and charm 
which (so report said) had sent more than one good man to 
the devil. 

On sunny days she would have her chair moved on to the 
wide, vine-sheltered verandah. She liked to see what was going 
on ; and she said that in Australia most things happened on 
verandahs. This particular one had been planned and built in early 
pioneering days, and had, no doubt, seen many ups and downs of 
varied incident. 

One could listen to her by the hour when she was in the vein 
for remembering pages from her own life or from other lawless lives 
of early days, when all country west of the station was unknown 
Australia. Like most old people, she was given to repetition, but 
she told me a story once which neither I nor anyone else could ever 
induce her to tell again. 

It was about a young wife — the most innocent of brides, who 
thought the world of her husband, and had no wish or look for 
other men. Yet the house was full of other men in those days, and 
they all gave thoughts or looks, more or less, to the prettiest woman 
in the district. Every evening she used to stand at her bedroom 
door, looking along the verandah, until she saw her husband 



250 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

returning from his work ; and every evening he brought her a rose 
from tlie big bush by the steps. That was during the first months of 
her marriage. Next year, the rose-bush bore as abundantly as ever^ 
but the man often forgot to pick a flower for her ; and, after a time^ 
he forgot altogether. 

The young wife was painfully ideal and long-suffering, and never 
gave him a word of reproach ; she was still so much in love with 
him that she was shy, and blushed like a girl when he came near 
her unexpectedly. &quot; Fancy : after two years of married life ! &quot; 
And the old lady smiled wickedly, and continued : 

&apos;* She was tired one night, and went to bed early, leaving her 
husband smoking and reading in the dining-room ; but it was so hot 
that she presently got up, threw on a gown, and strolled along the 
verandah in the shadow for a breath of cool air. The sultriness of 
the air brought out the strongest scent of the moonflowers. Just 
there, at the corner near the rose-bush, she saw her husband with 
his arms round a woman, kissing her lips over and over again — they 
were full, very red lips, such as men like to kiss. 

&quot;The woman was one of the housemaids — the soft-voiced, self- 
contained, velvet-footed one who usually brought in the tray for 
supper, and whose eyes never left the floor as she did so — a girl who- 
seemed to have no thought beyond her duties. 

&quot; The wife heard enough to show her that the woman had 
thoughts for many things besides — enough to tell her that those 
kisses were not the first by any means ; that the man&apos;s life had been 
a long lie, except, perhaps, during the very early days of marriage. 
She liked to think that he was all hers then. A delusion also,, 
possibly j but a harmless one. 

*&apos; As it was, she stole off to bed without saying a word. I call 
that a &apos;verandah tragedy,&apos; my dear; because her whole nature 
changed in a few moments. Not that there was much to notice one 
way or the other at first — except that she said she could not bear 
the scent of the moonflowers, and had the creeper taken up at the 
roots. She did not even send away the housemaid. Why should 
she 1 But things were a great deal more pleasant for the * other 



I 



A BOX OF DEAD ROSES. 251 



men&apos; afterwards — a great deal, my dear ! She used to sing and 
play to them, and dance with them, and flirt with them, and fill the 
house with visitors, and so on — in fact, she was a beauty, and had 
only just awakened to a knowledge of her power. You see, the 
station and money belonged to her ; so she was freer than most 
wives. 

&quot; There was the baby, of course — a lovely, soft-faced little thing 
that used to take its midday sleep in a string hammock, swung up 
there by the trellis. She was fond of the child ; yet, when it died 
and was buried by the lagoon in the garden, she used to sit dry-eyed, 
looking at the hammock that swung loosely in every breeze without 
its accustomed burden. She even said she was not sorry ; because 
the boy might have grown up to break some woman&apos;s heart, and the 
world was well rid of the breed. Perhaps it was best so ; though — 
looking at the other side of the question — he might have lived to 
blush for his mother. 

^k &quot; One day her husband was brought in, dead — kicked by the 
norse he was trying to catch in the yard. They carried him straight 
up the verandah to the big spare-room, and the blood was dripping,, 
dripping all the way. 

&quot; She was a tidy, methodical woman always, and she sent for 
the housemaid — the velvet-footed one — and bade her wash the 
boards. The girl had a wonderful power of self-command usually, 
yet, at sight of that blood, she shivered and trembled like one with 
the palsy. Sentimental people said the wife was perfectly inhuman 
to think of the state of her verandah at such a time — and, of 
course, a kind friend told her. She laughed as she said, &apos; No ! 
I am not heart-broken. I went through that experience twa 
years ago.&apos; 

&quot; Well, my dear &quot; (and the old lady&apos;s voice sounded a little 
tired), &quot;she lived a long, long life, and rather a varied and 
interesting one, from an outsider&apos;s point of view, at any rate. I 
often sit and think of her and of many things that happened on this 
old verandah, but of late years I forget a great deal. I like best to 
remember the days when the young wife used to stand listening,. 



252 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

listening for the husband&apos;s step — the sweetest music in the world 
to her. 

&quot; No doubt she was an arrant little fool and bored him to death. 
I think, now, that he was no worse than the majority of men : a 
clever, interesting woman could have managed him. She became 
all that afterwards — for other men ; but, as I said before, she was a 
totally different woman. Live every inch of your life, my dear ! &quot; 
finished the old lady, impressively. &quot; One life, one love ! — the idea 
is perfectly absurd.&quot; 

Two years later I saw the old lady again — feebler, worn in body 
and mind. She still sat in sunny weather on the verandah, but 
now she always had a little cardboard box on her lap, caressing it 
with her withered fingers. 

&quot; Look, my dear ! &quot; she said ; &quot; this box is full of dead rose- 
leaves — they all came off that bush by the corner, years ago. Young 
people are so careless and forgetful. I may die at any moment, and 
unless I had it with me they would never remember to bury it in 
my grave. They are the dearest things I possess ; the reason why 
they are so dear I shall carry a secret to my grave also.&quot; 

The old lady had forgotten that she had ever told me a 
story with roses in it.

A STRIPE FOR TROOPER CASEY. 

THE magpies had said good-night to the setting sun, and 
already darkness was moving through the dead timber. 
The tirst notes of night-birds came from the ridges, and a 
curlew mourned in the reeds of a creek. 

My brother Will shook his reins and rode away. 

&quot; Good-bye, Sis,&quot; he said ; &quot; I will be home pretty early.&quot; 

I smiled, knowing that he reckoned without his host. Will 
was visiting Lizzie Lacy, and Lizzie had a sweet face. Love&apos;s pretty 
trickeries upset many promises, and I knew that my brother would 
not return till the small hours. But what was love to me — a simple 
country girl with a heart to lose and nobody to find it ? 

The cold chilled my fingers, and I shuddered. I was alone, 
with no one to talk to. Mother and father had gone to Bathurst 
that day, and evil men walked the roads, lured west by the gleam 
of gold. As Will disappeared in the distance, fear struck through 
me like a chill wave. There was a dance at Staunton&apos;s, and Mary had 
invited me. I was sorry now that I had refused her. Still, if Mary&apos;s 
heart had been as perfect as her face, she would not have said hard 
things of poor me. She should have schooled her tongue, although she 
might be a fine woman — which was trooper Casey&apos;s estimate of her. 
The little successes that please a woman had spoilt her, gilding her 
pride till it dazzled one painfully. If I had grey eyes, it was God 
who had coloured them ; and someone has since told me that it is the 
pleasantest colour of all. She had said, as well, that my cheeks were 
red — country complexion. I blessed God for that also, because it 
meant health and strength. They could be pale enough at times — 
but pale only when hers would have been ashen. 

I remembered myself and laughed. All this bitterness because 



254 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Will was visiting Lizzie Lacy, and no one was coming to kiss my 
hand ! Silly Carrie, I said to myself, you must bide your time- 
You are over-young yet to harbour these thoughts. Time will 
surely bring you the rose, and as surely the thorn that wounds. 

I had turned to enter the house when Sally whinnied from a 
distance, and came down the green lane between the cultivation- 
paddocks at a high trot, her silver tail lifted in excitement and 
streaming out behind her. She halted at the slip-rails and stretched 
her head over them, coyly inviting a caress. I gave her a cake, 
smoothed her velvet nose, and talked to her till the trees in the 
distance were very dim. Now, while I fondled, I noticed a curious 
inattentiveness in the mare&apos;s manner. She seemed to heed me with 
one ear only. The other continually flickered back and quivered as 
though distracted by a distant sound. Listen intently as I might, 
I could discover nothing. Peer as I would, I saw dead trees and 
naught else. But this listening and peering made me fretful and 
afraid ; and, with a final pull at Sally&apos;s forelock — a lingering pull 
that told how loath I was to leave her — I turned and entered the 
house. 

The fire burned steadily. All the little sticks that splash and 
splutter and noise so much were in white heaps, and only two great 
logs of ironbark glowed sullenly. I lit a lamp, sat down, and gazed 
into the fire : sweet pastime for pensive moments. At a girl&apos;s age&quot; 
of-dreams, questions come in troops, and a log&apos;s red side is often rich 
with fancy-food. My head pillowed on an arm, I looked sideways 
down. The fire drowsed my eyes, and in a little while sleep shut 
them wholly. Remember, at that period Crime went down the 
roads in many guises ! 

I awoke with a start and looked towards the door. Two men 
stood in the room — a tall and a short man. They were dressed in 
sailor clothes, and the eyes of one squinted horribly. 

&apos;* Who are you ? &quot; I said, rising to my feet and feeling strangely 
nervous. 

&apos;•Weary men, lassie,&quot; said the tall man. 

&quot; All the way from Sydney,&quot; added the other. 



A STRIFE FOB TROOPER CASEY, 255 

&quot; With not a bite for two blessed days,&quot; continued the first. 

&quot;And ne&apos;er a sup,&quot; said the second. 

&quot; Indeed,&quot; I remarked, pretending sympathy with their lie ; 
■*&apos; that is hard. But I will give you full and plenty, and when you 
^re satisfied you must go — for,&quot; I continued, thinking to soften the 
words, &quot;we do not allow any strangers to sleep here.&quot; 

&quot; Yes,&quot; said the tall man ; &quot; feed us well, good lassie.&quot; 

&quot;And,&quot; added the other, &quot; being satisfied, we&apos;ll leave you all 

rne.&quot; 
Then they both chuckled, and moved to the table. 

As I laid cold meat and cream and bush honey before them, a 
nervousness assailed me that made my hands dance. 

&quot;All alone, lassie?&quot; said the tall man at last, throwing himself 
back in his chair. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, but — recognising my mistake instantly — 
continued : &quot; That is, for a little while. I expect my brother every 
instant — he ii with trooper Casey.&quot; 

The short man lit his pipe, the tall one following suit. &quot; Time 
to be gone, then,&quot; remarked the latter. 

The other drew the stem from his lips and expelled a long 
white plume. &quot; Which first ? &quot; he said. 

&quot; The gilt,&quot; said the tall man. 

I heard the words, and suddenly sprang up and ran for the 
door. &quot; Money first,&quot; I thought ; &quot; what second 1 &quot; 

&quot; Ah, would you ! &quot; said the short man, leaping in front. 

&quot; Let me pass ! &quot; I cried ; &quot; someone is coming.&quot; 

He did not move, but stood with folded arms, smiling coarsely. 

&quot; A sweetheart, perhaps, lassie ? 

*• My brother,&quot; I answered. 

The tall man opened the door, put out his head, and listened. 
A moment after he drew in and shut the door. 

&quot; No one,&quot; he said ; &quot; the lassie &apos;s mistaken.&quot; 

&quot; Come ! &quot; said the short man, extending his arms. 

I retreated as he advanced, till at length I stood by the fire. I 
was all flushed with rage, and cold with fear. 



256 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; My brother is a big man,&quot; I said ; &quot; he could kill you both 
with one blow.&quot; 

They laughed brutally, and the short man said, &quot;He has a 
pretty sister.&quot; 

&quot;If you are men you will not harm me. Tell me what you 
want, and I will give it you.&quot; 

&apos;&apos;Take her at her word,&quot; interrupted the tall man, coming 
forward. 

&quot; I will,&quot; replied the other. &quot; What will you give us ? &quot; 

&quot; What do you want ? &quot; I asked, brightening. 

&quot; One thing and another, lassie,&quot; said he. 

&quot; Tobacco,&quot; suggested his companion ; &quot; tea and sugar and 
i3our ■&apos; 

&quot;A word in your ear, lassie!&quot; interrupted the short man,, 
touching me with an outstretched hand. 

But I drew away, and tried to look down from my little height. 

&quot; Go out of the door, sir ! — this is my father&apos;s house ! &quot; 

&quot; Pert words from pretty lips,&quot; said the short man. &quot; A kiss I 
—a kiss ! &quot; 

With that he had me in his arms, and drew me in close. I 
struggled, at first in silence, but at the touch of his bearded face 
threw back my head and filled the house with cries. He did not 
desist — only grew fiercer ; nor did his fellow make any motion to 
release me. His grasp was like that of a vyce, and blue marks remained 
long after. Once in the struggle I saw stars, and thought a wicked 
dream had passed. A gust of cold wind struck my cheeks, and I 
strove to free myself. Then the wind blew again, and again I saw 
stars — the door was open and someone stood in the doorway. It 
was a man — tall as a giant, I thought, and the curse he thundered 
seemed like a great song. 

The sailor released me and drew apart, laughing to lighten his 
guilt. 

&quot; God bless you ! &quot; I said, moving to the door — both hands on 
my heart, for it was panting fiercely. 

Before I reached him the stranger raised a hand to make me 




A STRIPE FOB TROOPER CASEY. 257 

pause. He had a gun at his shoulder, — a long, bright barrel that 
gleamed fitfully. 

&quot; In the nick of time,&quot; he said calmly ; &quot; which first ? &quot; 

I looked at the two sailors. They stood close together, 
distressed by fear. The tall man slanted sideways, like a sapling 
from the wind, and the short one cowered behind an upraised arm 
as if to ward a blow. 

&quot; Which first ? &quot; said the stranger again. 

&quot; Neither ! &quot; I replied, shuddering. 

He sloped his rifle a little, looked at me cynically, and hinted 
something that filled me with shame. 

&quot; No, no,&quot; I cried ; &quot; do not say that ! I never saw them before, 
and I am a good girl.&quot; 

A smile crept across his lips, and his wide, dark eyes softened. 

&quot; I believe it,&quot; he said shortly. 

*He stepped forward and halted in the centre of the room. 
&quot; You were hungry ? &quot; he said to the short man. 

The man nodded. 

&quot; And she fed you on cream and honey — the best she had ? &quot; 

The man did not answer. 

The gun went to the shoulder again, and the dark eyes looked 
along the levelled barrel. 

&quot; And you wanted to pay her in your own foul coin. Now for 
this,&quot; he continued, &quot; I &apos;ve a mind to put hot lead in your brain.&quot; 

I ran forward with a great dread lest he should do as he 
threatened. 

&quot; Go away ! &quot; I cried to the sailors ; &quot; go quickly, while you are 
safe ! &quot; 

The men turned as if to slink ofl^ but the stranger warned them 
to stand very still. 

&quot;You must be punished for this night&apos;s work,&quot; he said; &quot; and 
then you may go — both of you — as far as Berrima.&quot; 

The two men started and eyed him keenly. 

&quot;Just so, just so,&quot; he said, nodding from one to the other ; &quot; a 
guilty conscience, eh 1 &quot; 

Q 



258 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

They scowled and sank their eyes, and he turned to me. 

&quot; Get your whip ! &quot; he said. 

I stood irresolute, and he continued : 

&quot; My arm is tired holding this gun. They should have been 
dead long ago. Get your whip ! &quot; 

I ran away, got my whip, and returned. 

&quot; Go forward and strike that man across the face.&quot; 

&quot;It would be cruel,&quot; I replied. 

&quot; Quick ! or he will be dead before you reach him ! &quot; 

Then I was in front of the sailor. 

&quot; Lift your arm,&quot; the stranger said. 

Then he told me to strike with all my force — &quot; As you would a 
wicked steer.&quot; 

I obeyed with some hesitation, and struck lightly. But 
presently faint-heartedness forsook me. At the second lifting of 
the whip a sudden spirit of mastery surged my arm with fierceness, 
so that I dealt some savage blows. The sailor sheltered his eyes 
with his hands and cried aloud for mercy. Then I suddenly 
remembered myself and drew away, shuddering and half in tears. 

&quot;Good!&quot; said the stranger. &quot;And now for the other — they 
are mates.&quot; 

&quot; He did not offer me any hurt,&quot; I replied. 

The stranger looked at him. &quot; You are lucky,&quot; he said. 

The man&apos;s face lightened with pleasure. 

&quot; But less lucky than you think, my good man,&quot; he continued. 

I noticed the white fear that came into the tall man&apos;s face, and 
the sudden upward look of his companion. 

&quot; Come here ! &quot; said the stranger, beckoning to the short man. 

The sailor approached, trembling. After a few paces had been 
taken, &quot; Halt ! &quot; the stranger cried. 

The man stood still on the instant. 

&quot; Squint-eyed, and with the limp of the leg-iron — dressed like a 
sailor ! &quot; said the stranger, in loud, clear tones. &quot; Get some saddle 
straps, my girl ! &quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; 






A STRIPE FOB TROOPER CASEY. 259 



&quot; Get them ! &quot; he said, shortly. 

I went away, and displeasure at his brusque manner made my 
cheeks burn. Did it paint them also — that he spoke so gently on 
my return ? 

&quot;I am not used to ladies, and I mean no offence,&quot; he said. 

I forgave him, and said that I had felt none. &quot; Your action 
to-night shows that you are a good man.&quot; 

&quot; Perhaps,&quot; he replied ; &quot; but one star does not make a heaven.&quot; 

He was silent, and I forebore to ask what he meant. He 
motioned for the straps, and I gave them. 

Then he turned to the men, and his voice hardened. 

&quot; Down on your faces ! &quot; he thundered, &quot; quick ! quick ! both oS 
you, or &quot; 

They were down on the instant, abject as worms. 

&quot;Now take this gun, my girl,&quot; he said, &quot;and if that man so 
much as wriggles, shoot him. I will manage the other.&quot; 

The man was fashioned to command. I took the gun, and if 
the prostrate figure had moved then it would never have moved 
again. But the sailors were utterly cowed, and did not murmur 
while the stranger pinioned their hands behind them. This done, 
he rolled them over and looked down at them. 

&quot; What does this mean ? &quot; I said. 

*&apos; A stripe for trooper Casey,&quot; he replied, and laughed. 

&quot; For trooper Casey 1 I do not understand ? &quot; 

&quot; You will, in time,&quot; he replied. 

With that, I had to content myself. Who this man was, with 
the command on his lips, and the disobey-me-if-you-dare in his eyes, 
I did not know. I only know that he had reserves of gentleness, 
which spoke through his harsher moods like a bird&apos;s song in a 
storm. 

&quot; You, there ! &quot; he said to the short man ; &quot; do you know what 
they are doing at Weatherley&apos;s ? &quot; 

The sailor turned his face aside, and was mute. 

&quot; Or you ? &quot; to the tall man. 

&quot; No,&quot; the man replied. &quot; Where is Weatherley&apos;s 1 &quot; 



260 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; Liars — both of you ! &quot; said the stranger. &quot; Weatherley&apos;s, 
under the Range.&quot; 

&quot; What are they doing ? &quot; I interposed. 

&quot; Burying a dead woman, he replied, looking from one to the 
other of the prostrate men, and nodding as he changed his gaze. 

&quot; How sad ! &quot; I cried. &quot; Poor Mrs. Weatherley ! When did 
she die ? &quot; 

&quot;Yesterday.&quot; 

&quot; She was a strong woman.&quot; 

&quot; She met someone stronger.&quot; 

&quot; You mean Death ! &quot; 

&quot; Death, and two devils ! &quot; — he ground his teeth. 

I looked at him in wonder. 

&quot; Two devils — what do you mean ? &quot; 

The short man lay on his side, looking up as a beaten dog looks 
at his master. The stranger spurned him with a foot. 

&quot; Answer ! &quot; he said ; &quot; which of you killed her ? &quot; 

&quot; Not me,&quot; groaned the sailor ; &quot; &apos;t was the bushrangers.&quot; 

&quot; You liar ! &quot; cried the stranger in a rising, incredulous voice, 

as though he doubted his own ears. &quot; We do not &quot; He paused 

and looked at me, and saw that he had revealed himself. 

&quot; Ah ! &quot; I whispered as he turned away. I iinderstood now, 
and yet he did not seem as black as people painted him. 

&quot; I tried to hide it,&quot; he said ; &quot; but it slipped out. It is a bad 
thing even at its best.&quot; 

Then he looked very downcast, and I pitied him. An angel 
impulse stirred me, and I stepped forward, raised my face, and 
kissed him. 

&quot; Good ! &quot; he said, his fine eyes flashing, &quot; &apos;tis a long time 
since &quot; 

He lowered his voice and continued, as if to himself : &quot; But 
what does it matter ? She is only a child.&quot; 

&quot; To-night has made me a woman,&quot; I replied. 

&quot; No, no ! you are a child. No woman would do a thing like 
that. But some day you will be a woman. Then you will kiss with 



A STRIPE FOR TROOPER CASEY. 261 

the lips only, not with the heart — cheating the heart that 
loves you.&quot; 

It was some minutes before he spoke again. 

&quot; I saw a horse in the stockyard,&quot; he said ; &quot; bring him round. 
I want you to go somewhere.&quot; 

And when Sally was ready at the door and I in the saddle, he 
continued : &quot; Ride to Staunton&apos;s — Casey is there. Tell him &quot; — this 
with a low laugh — &quot;that the man who borrowed his horse at 
Weatherboard waits here to give him a stripe in exchange. Come 
back with him yourself.&quot; 

I turned Sally&apos;s head to be gone immediately. 

&quot; Wait — another word ! Would you like to see me dead or 
trooper Casey dead ? &quot; 

&quot; Oh, no ; how can you ask ? &quot; 

&quot; I distrust women,&quot; he returned, &quot; since I met Judas in 
petticoats.&quot; 

&quot; Try me,&quot; I replied ; &quot;I could not be false after what you 
have done.&quot; 

&quot; When you come to the bridge, cooee ! I will be here watching 
these brutes, and when I hear your cry I will up and away.&quot; 

As Sally moved off some words followed from the door, where 
he stood in the light. 

&quot; Good-bye, little girl ! &quot; 

&quot; Good-bye ! and I will always remember you.&quot; 

A curlew wailed, and the stranger laughed — to make the 
parting easy, it seemed. Yet something that Nature had put into 
the curlew&apos;s wail went through the man&apos;s voice and saddened me 
for many days. It seemed that both bird and man mourned some- 
thing lost. 

I galloped along the track that made a siding in the green hill 
and slanted to the creek. Sally&apos;s hoofs rattled on the turpentine 
planking of the bridge, and presently struck fire from the ironstone 
on the farther side. Where the track wound through wild hops 
I gave her free head; for there was open country. Where the 
scrub crept in she slackened of her own will, not liking the rebound

of the bushes. In a little while we came to a second creek, where 
bullocks&apos; heads in a white line made stepping-stones. She crossed it 
with a bound and a splash, and climbed the slope beyond in a few 
strides. Another mile brought me to Staunton&apos;s log-fence, and 
through the trees I saw bright windows. A little later there 
came to me a concertina&apos;s music and other sounds of merry- 
making. 

I fastened Sally to the stockyard gate, and walked through the 
doorway. A number of couples were there, swinging round and 
round in a dance. As I walked into the room I felt strangely out 
of harmony with the surroundings, the music having put a spirit 
in my feet that made them seem to drag. 

Mary Staunton had trooper Casey for a partner. She looked 
very fine and pale, but as she went by she scarcely deigned to notice 
me. Trooper Casey was six feet high, and had curly hair — the hair 
that women fancy. Every time he wheeled his metal buttons 
flashed. When the dance finished he was near me. I touched him 
on the arm. 

&quot; Mr. Casey ! &quot; 

&quot; Hallo, Carrie ! &quot; said Mary Staunton, in affected welcome ; 
&quot; how late you are ! &quot; 

&quot; I did n&apos;t come to dance, Mary — only to see Mr. Casey.&quot; 

&quot;Ah, I should have known,&quot; she answered, with a little 
mocking laugh, and with a glance at my dress where Sally had 
splashed it in crossing the creek. 

I tossed my head and turned from her. 

&quot; Trooper Casey, can you spare a moment ? &quot; 

** What do you want ? Say what you want, here and now,&quot; 
said Mary Staunton. &quot; That is, if you &apos;re not afraid of us 
hearing it.&quot; 

&quot;I intended this for you alone&quot; — I addressed the trooper — 
&quot;but now&quot; — with a sidelong look at his sweetheart — &quot;everyone 
may hear it.&quot; 

&quot; What is it. Miss Anson ?&quot; 

&quot; Do you want a stripe ? &quot; 



r 



A STRIPE FOR TROOPER CASEY. 263 



&quot; Why, one &apos;d think you were the Governor&apos;s lady,&quot; said Mary 
Staunton, laughing so that I blushed. 

I took no notice of her, other than turning my back, and then 
I smiled quietly as I spoke. 

&quot; A gentleman waits at our house to pay you for a horse he 
borrowed at Weatherboard.&quot; 

I watched him keenly to see how he took the news. On his 
cheeks two red spots stood out and burned. He gnawed his under- 
lip, and there was a suppressed anger in his eyes, that glowed like 
covered tires. From those standing around there went up a great 
laugh, and Casey turned to a group who forced their merriment 
overlong. 

*&apos; You are great laughers,&quot; said he; &quot;but are you men enough 
to fight?&quot; 

None of them made a movement to accept the challenge ; but, 
on the other hand, it was curious to see how speedily the laughter 
faded from their faces, giving place to something almost sad. 

Then up spoke Mary Staunton. 

&quot; Carrie Anson,&quot; said she, with tremulous white lips, &quot; if you 
come here to insult people, you&apos;d better stay away.&quot; 

&quot; Don&apos;t mind her, Mary,&quot; said the trooper ; &quot; it &apos;s a trick some 
fool has made her play.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed it is not,&quot; I replied. &quot;The man who gave me that 
message is waiting at our house with two sailors, and one of them &quot; 
— I dropped my voice so that only he and Mary heard — &quot; killed 
Mrs. Weatherly.&quot; 

The trooper started, as though shot through ; looked me in the 
«yes, and drew a long breath. &quot; By God ! &quot; he cried, and moved 
towards the door. 

&quot;It is three to one, Mary,&quot; he said. 

&quot; Do not go ! &quot; she answered ; &quot; you may be killed.&quot; 

&quot; It is man to man, trooper! &quot; I interrupted; &quot;two are bound 
and the third keeps watch.&quot; 

&quot;Stuff!&quot; exclaimed Mary, viciously: &quot;he keep watch! You 
will not go alone, trooper.&quot; 



264 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot;Alone! I must take the man. Where are my carbine 
and cap ? &quot; 

&quot; Take someone ! &quot; pleaded Mary. 

&quot;No,&quot; Casey replied, &quot;I will do this myself. If I succeed you 
know what it means,&quot; — and he looked earnestly into her eyes. 

I laughed pleasantly. 

&quot; I shall be a bridesmaid — eh, Mary 1 &quot; 

She did not smile, but went off with a set face, swaying her 
skirts behind her. 

&quot;With the help of God, Miss Anson,&quot; whispered Casey, 
confidentially, &quot;I shall make three prisoners to-night.&quot; 

&quot; With the help of God, you shall not, trooper Casey ! &quot; I 
whispered to myself. 

As the trooper turned to leave the room, his carbine on his 
back, his sabre at his side, and his cap pressing a cushion of brown 
curls, I did not wonder Mary Staunton had lost her heart to him. 
He was a man to delight any eyes. 

Some came forward and offered to assist him, but these he 
refused coldly. I passed out and was in the saddle before he had 
mounted. 

Then he said, in surprise, &quot;You must stay here, Miss Anson.&quot; 

&quot; I must go home, trooper Casey.&quot; 

&quot; There may be bloodshed.&quot; 

&quot;There must be none.&quot; 

&quot; You are very brave,&quot; he said, suspiciously ; &quot;are you sure it 
is no hoax ? &quot; 

&quot; Follow me, if you are not a coward ! &quot; I replied. 

As I passed her, Mary Staunton muttered something about 
&quot;an interfering minx.&quot; The trooper she warned to be careful. In 
my heart I believe that she thought his chief peril lay in me, and I 
laughed to think that, after all, an outlaw may not be the greatest 
danger in a man&apos;s path. 

As the trooper rode after, his bridle jingled in the silence. 

&quot; Miss Anson,&quot; said he, &quot;these sailors that you spoke of — was 
one a tall man ? &quot; 



A STRIPE FOB TROOPER CASEY. 265 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot; And the other short ? &quot; 

&quot;With a squint.&quot; 

&quot;Just so,&quot; — and he relapsed into silence. 

The track was narrow, with no room for two horses. This 
prevented us from riding abreast, and gave me an excuse to keep in 
front. Several times Casey urged his horse forward, but I patted 
Sally and she kept her place. At the creek he made a bold bid to 
front me, but the mare flashed forward and headed him at the 
farther side. 

&quot; Draw aside, and let me ride in front, Miss Anson.&quot; 

I answered that I knew the way quite well. 

&quot; That may be, but I have a different reason.&quot; 

I was dumb, having nothing to answer. 

&quot;There may be danger ahead,&quot; he continued; &quot;and you are 
foolish.&quot; 

I cast about for an answer, and remembered a last week&apos;s storm. 

&quot;There is danger,&quot; I replied; &quot;a fallen tree, and you might 
flounder in the branches.&quot; 

He muttered something under his breath, but I did not catch 
the word. 

In a little while we reached the fallen tree and rode round it. 
Beyond he spoke again. 

&quot; You can have no objection now.&quot; 

&quot;None whatever,&quot; I said, &quot;only that a little way along a 
swarm of bees have fastened to a limb. You might mistake them 
for a wart and brush them with your shoulder. That would not be 
pleasant, would it ? &quot; — and I laughed to gild the prevarication. But 
Casey, seeing no humour in the situation, remained dumb. 

Presently I cried out to him to bevv^are of the bees, and he listed 
in his saddle. 

&quot;Now?&quot; he asked. 

&quot; Not yet, trooper ; we are in the bush and I prefer to stay 
where I am, because if you rode in front the branches would come 
back and sting Sally&apos;s eyes.&quot; 



266 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; Rubbish ! &quot; muttered Casey. 

When we were through the bush and among the hops, he 
suddenly bade me halt. 

&quot; You must play no tricks, Miss Anson ! &quot; 

&quot; La ! who is playing them, Mr. Casey 1 &quot; 
• &quot; The man at your house is a desperado.&quot; 

&quot; Is he, indeed ? &quot; — with all the innocence of the world in my 
voice. 

&quot;And you are an accomplice.&apos;* 

*&apos; Dear me, what does that mean, trooper ? &apos;* 

&quot; It means that you must stay where you are.&quot; 

&quot; But I must go home.&quot; 

&quot; Then I shall arrest you.&quot; 

&quot; Arrest me, and let three grown men go free ! &quot; 

&quot;But you make it necessary,&quot; he said. 

&quot; Trooper, the desperado is a brave man, and would be as likely 
to kill you as you would be to kill him.&quot; 

&quot; Have no fears for me. Miss Anson.&quot; 

&quot; I have none.&quot; 

&quot; Then they are for * 

&quot; The man who saved me ? &quot; — and I went away like an arrow. 
It was the first time I had come into conflict with the law, and the 
situation thrilled me. Casey with a great oath thundered close 
behind, calling on me in a low voice to hold up, and muttering 
dire consequences. I laughed, bent forward, and bade Sally do 
her best. It was necessary, since his horse had better pace and 
gained greatly at every stride. Now the animal&apos;s nose was at 
my saddle, now at Sally&apos;s shoulder, and now we raced level to the 
bridge. 

I rose in the saddle, threw up my face, and sent a long, long 
&quot; Coo-ee I Coo-ee ! &quot; speeding across the open. 

&quot; Hush, you hoyden ! &quot; 

I tugged at the reins, throwing Sally back on her haunches, 
and again I cooeed. 

Then I sat back and listened. The trooper was now a fading 



A STRIPE FOR TROOPER CASEY. 267 

bulk in the dark. The speed of his horse on the siding was terrible, 
and his rein and sabre jingled fiercely. 

Then, one — two — three, came the sounds of slip-rails falling. I 
sat back in the saddle with a sigh of deep content, and breathed as 
I had not for many minutes. Par and farther away I heard another 
horse, his hoof-thuds in the dead timber sounding like footfalls in 
an empty house. 

*&apos; You have done good work to-night,&quot; said trooper Casey, when 
I entered the room a little later ; &quot; fine work for a decent, self- 
respecting girl.&quot; 

I picked up his sleeve where the silver braid circled it. 

&quot; This looks lonely, trooper : it would be prettier if there were 
two of them, would it not 1 &quot; 

He smiled in a wintry way, and this gave me heart to say that 
the stranger was not so bad, after all. 

Casey shook his head. 

&quot; Bad enough,&quot; he replied. 

Will came in shortly after, and these words followed : 

&quot; Where did you meet him ? &quot; 

&quot; At the boundary gate,&quot; Will answered. 

&quot; What did he say 1 &quot; 

&quot; Looked along his gun and ordered me to hoist my hands.&quot; 

&quot;And then?&quot; 

&quot; Took my horse and watch — and left me his animal.&quot; 

&quot; Never mind,&quot; said the trooper quietly, &quot; I have two prisoners. 
And he was not so bad, after all — eh. Miss Anson ? &quot; 

&quot; No, trooper ; especially if it should happen that the horse he 
left is the same that he borrowed.&quot; 

Casey rose to look out at the dawn. 

RODERIC QUINN. 



SWAMP-SWALLOWED. 

A CROSS the long perspective of the mangrove flats the sun 
J-^ glared fierce and crimson. From the black mud-banks 
white, pestilential vapours rose upon the torpid air. A 
subtler miasm quivered over the long stretches of mephitic ooze, 
against the sickly green of which gleamed out the hideous reds and 
yellows of fantastic crabs that scuttled — as the boat came near — 
into pools prismatic with stagnation. Beneath the slimy surface 
the banded water-snakes glanced to and fro : from the reed-beds 
came in hungry swarms the tiger-mosquitoes ; and from the man- 
grove-roots the sword-flies darted out in swift detachments upon 
the half -nude rowers — sweltering in a bath of vegetable fetor. 

Of the white men, one would have fired at the log-like 
immobility of a crocodile, basking untroubled of that &quot; instinctive 
terror of man&quot; which is but one of man&apos;s own anthropocentric 
delusions. But the other said, &quot; No ! &quot; He was a tan-faced old 
fellow with a wide, grim mouth and stiff, white, ape-like whiskers. 

&quot;Fire a shot here and we may as well go back! Curious 
acoustics, these places have. The report of a gun wanders up and 
down the swamps and creeks as if it was never going to stop ! &quot; 

&quot; You &apos;ve been here before, then ? &quot; 

&quot; Would n&apos;t be here now if I had n&apos;t, and if I did n&apos;t count 
myself fever-proof. But as for you. Green &quot; 

Green — young and smooth-faced, but big, brick-red, and square- 
jawed — cut in, &quot; No more of me, old man ! I &apos;11 see this thing 
through ! And, anyhow, if / &apos;m not fever-proof, I &apos;m pretty well 
past praying for by this time ! See ? &quot; 

&quot;I see you &apos;re good stuff, at any rate ! And nothing else will 
do for this job. Let &apos;s sum up — leaving out such items as heat and 




SWAMP-SWALLO WED. 269 

insects. Fever, snakes, sunstroke, poisoned arrows from the Dyaks, 
treachery from these chaps of our own, and, after all — perhaps 
nothing at the end of it ! &quot; 

&quot; I &apos;m game for all but the last. Heavens ! Redfern, that 
would be a crusher.&quot; 

&quot; Crusher ? &quot; Redfern leaned over to the young fellow. &quot; This 
is it. I &apos;m five and sixty ; here &apos;s my first chance of a pile, and I &apos;ve 
staked on it whatever &apos;s left me, — say ten or fifteen years. It &apos;s 
worth it. But, you — you might have lived for seventy years, yet.&quot; 

&quot; Confound it ! man, you talk as if it was all up with me. My 
chance is as good as yours, at all events.&quot; 

The other man said nothing. He had private reasons for being 
of a different opinion. 

Through pallid, steam-like mist — the visible breath of Death — 
the rising moon made faint light for the two men groping in the 
stinking mud, and shrinking, now and then, from the horrid, 
unnamed things their hands encountered. For half-an-hour they 
toiled, till to the knees and elbows they were foul with evil-smelling 
filth. Then Green gave up. 

&quot; This is the place, right enough,&quot; he said — &quot; according to your 
map. Triangle between three creeks ; gravel bluff at one end ; 
three mangroves in the middle. And between them we &apos;ve searched 
nearly every inch. If your friend Kussoab was n&apos;t a first-class liar, 
he was mad ! Either way, it &apos;s — ugh ! &quot; Something was wriggling 
from the mud between his feet, and, springing smartly from the 
spot, he slipped and fell backwards. 

&quot; It &apos;s only a goocha ! &quot; Redfern kicked the fish-like saurian 
ten feet away. &quot; What a fool you are : Hullo ! — are you hurt ? &quot; 

For Green lay where he had fallen — not hurt, but thinking 
hard. One hand, as he came down, had touched a stone, and any 
stone, in that absolutely rockless region, must be the stone they 
sought — the stone which covered the treasure he had till now but 
half-believed in. And with belief came greed and quick resolve. 
A part ! — he would have all ! &quot; This old man&apos;s day is past ! — mine &apos;s 



270 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

to come ! And what I mean for him, no doubt, is no more than he 
meant for me ! &quot; 

All this in the ten seconds before Redfern helped him to his 
feet. &quot; Let &apos;s get back to the boat,&quot; Green said, then, &quot; for the 
present, at any rate. I feel infernally queer.&quot; 

Back to the boat they picked their squelching way, the elder 
man puzzled, but not yet suspicious. It was when they had drunk 
of &quot; gunny-water,&quot; made of rum and quinine, that a glimmer of 
the truth came to Redfern, — the more readily that he had himself 
determined, if the find were made, to &quot; lose &quot; his partner in this 
hellish wet wilderness of Manduka. For thus together do the wits 
of scoundrels jump. 

Thicker still the ghastly fever-fog hung round the shadowy 
boat ; but the moon was in mid-heaven and the light had increased, 
when Green sat up and looked around the boat — silent, but for the 
snoring of the weary Malay rowers. Neither was there visible the 
inevitable cheroot-glow which would have told of Redfern&apos;s wake- 
fulness. Green stole from under the awning and over the side. 

Redfern, a minute later, raised his head and listened — then 
took his rifle and slipped also away into the half-illumined mist, 
which immediately thereafter yielded up a dusky figure that got 
hastily into the boat and woke its fellows, for the Malay crew had, 
since dark, been one man short — a secret watcher upon the doings of 
the whites. Then, by the light of a little cocoa-nut lamp, six 
swarthy faces gloated over a broken kris — the fragment of the 
blade rust-eaten to a rugged skewer, but the hilt, of damp-defying 
gold, set thick with stones that sparkled even through the clinging 
slime. 

The frogs forbore their raucous chorus — alarmed by Redfern&apos;s 
strident laughter. 

&quot;What a guileless innocent you take me for ! You sneak back 
here when you think I &apos;m asleep, and you show me a hole that &quot; — 
with a sneer — &quot; somebody else made ! Really, now, young man — 



SWAMP-SWALLOWED, 271 

which is to say, young scoundrel ! young thief ! — you might credit 
me with some brains.&quot; 

Green stamped up a shower of mud. &quot; Scoundrel yourself ! 
Brains or no brains ! — there &apos;s the hole, and / did n&apos;t make it. And, 
besides, if I found anything, where is it ? &quot; 

Redfern threw up his rifle. &quot; Exactly ! &quot; he said. &quot; That &apos;s 
what I want to know. Where is it 1 &quot; 

Green stooped his head. &quot; Listen ! &quot; he said ; &quot; there &apos;s your 
answer ! &quot; 

A hurried sound of oars came faintly through the sluggish air, 
and both men made off, stumbling and squattering in their haste to 
reach the main creek. 

They were too late ! A scornful yell from far away in the fog 
was all that answered to their shouts. 

With the earliest grey of morning Redfern sprang from the 
mangrove-root on which he had sat silent for hours. &quot; Come ! &quot; he 
said, &quot; let &apos;s get away from here, at all events. Getting out of the 
jManduka s another matter ! &quot; 

Green slowly raised himself from the mud and lit his pipe. 
&quot; What chance is there of that?&quot; he asked sullenly. 

&quot; About one in a hundred ! &quot; Redfern answered, belying his 
belief, for he was a man of science, not ill- versed in jungle-craft, and 
he thought the odds were in favour of his own escape — unhampered 
by a tyro&apos;s company. 

He eyed his double-rifle as he headed westward through the 
dreary, dripping mangroves. His cartridges — save the two in the 
barrels — had gone with the boat. &quot;I could not spare a bullet, even 
if &apos; The other called him, and he turned. 

Green, up to his ankles in mud, was dragging out each foot 
in turn — only to sink the other deeper as his weight came on 
it. And the up-turned stuff — though the surface was a glossy 
green — was of a dirty saffron hue. A &quot;porridge-pot,&quot; Redfern 
knew it for, and, on the instant, turned and made off. This — with- 
out his intervention — would rid him of his incumbrance, though to

see the poor wretch slowly perish there was no need. But — blindly 
rushing from the other&apos;s cries — a word came to his ears that 
stopped him. 

« The kris !— the kris ! I have it, after all ! &quot; 

Redfern sped back to where the struggling Green — with wild 
eyes starting from his fear-blanched face — was clawing frantically at 
the viscid horror that, by this time, held him to the middle. 
Testing with his rifle-butt, Redfern swiftly found the limit of the 
fatal &quot;porridge,&quot; and, flinging himself full length upon the firmer 
ground, thrust out the barrels to the utmost. 

&quot; What did you say about the kris ? &quot; he panted, as he lay. 

&quot; I have it ! &quot; Green gasped, as he got one hand on the muzzles. 
&quot; If I sink, it sinks with me ! &quot; 

And, lying thus for life, he plucked the rifle towards him — and 
one charge, exploding, sent its bullet through his neck. Then 
Redfern, stretching eagerly to reach Green&apos;s inside-pocket — was 
caught himself ! 

For twenty horrible minutes he fought, and prayed, and swore, 
and yelled to earless solitudes. And, when the noise had ceased, a 
monstrous green batrachian — squatting on the double grave — 
croaked solemnly that all was well I

BAILIFFS I HAVE MET. 

IT has been remarked that the worst use to which you can put a 
man is to hang him. A mistake. You can put him to a still 
|H worse use. You can make hira a bailiff. 

IMr I am writing this article in bed, using as a desk a box which 
at one time, according to the printed legend pasted on its lid, 
contained seven pounds nett of cocoanut ice. It commenced its 
career coldly, this poor little box; but it shall end warmly and 
famously. To-morrow morning I shall split it up into neat little 
splinters, to which I shall deftly set fire, and therewith boil my 
coffee. I know that in years to come, when I shall have lost my 
taste for coffee and all other worldly pleasures, relic collectors will 
wish that I had not done this thing ; but one can&apos;t boil coffee on 
posthumous glory. 

Alexander Pope is said to have written most of his translation 
of the Iliad in bed, but that was mere luxurious laziness on his 
part. I am writing in bed for the reason that if I were up I would 
have to sit on the floor to write — a position which, besides being 
uncomfortable, is apt to make one round-shouldered. 

The intelligent reader will gather from the foregoing remarks 
that the bailiff has been with me. He has been, with a vengeance, 
and liked my taste in furniture so well that he took it all away with 
him, including even my little Japanese tobacco-jar, and a Satsuma 
spittoon of fantastic elegance. I should n&apos;t have cared so much if 
he had left me my engraving of Don Quixote, which used to bring 
the tears to my eyes every time I looked at it. The noble knight- 
errant is shown sitting in his chamber, with all his armour 
around him. His withered hands, with their bony knuckles and 
outstanding veins and sinews, are clasped on the hilt of his long,

cross-hilted sword, and there is a look of visionary exaltation in his 
faded eyes which is in itself an inspiration. The valourous 
Manchegan had also his troubles with the world, even as I 
have mine. 

It is now twelve years ago since T gathered my first practical 
knowledge of bailifidom. Even then I did not see a bailiff in the 
flesh, but I stood in the place — he had left nothing to sit upon — 
where a bailiff had been, only a few hours before. It was after 
dusk, one evening in autumn, and, as I knocked at the door of the 
house in which dwelt my guide, philosopher, and friend of those 
early days, I thought that the knock sounded singularly loud, as 
though the house were empty. So it was, in a sense, — its sole 
contents being my philosopher and his wife and family. They were 
seated on the floor, in a circle, around a sheet of newspaper, upon 
which were displayed two or three loaves of bread, a paper bag 
containing sugar, a large billycan of tea, and some tinned sardines 
They were eating with their fingers, and drinking in turns out of a 
pannikin, which passed from hand to hand, in the manner of a 
bottle at a small and informal convivial gathering of friends. &quot; You 
observe,&quot; said my philosopher, with a nod at the newspaper, and a 
wave of his hand towards the bare walls, &quot; you observe, my young 
sage, how little the natural man really needs to satisfy his legitimate 
requirements. All else is mere superfluous luxury. The bailiff 
relieved me of my superfluous luxury this morning. I bear him no 
malice on that account. A man of letters &quot; (my philosopher was a 
contributor to the weekly papers, but always called himself a man 
of letters) &quot; should fly light in the matter of furniture.&quot; 

I looked at the squabbling children on the floor, and thought that 
the remark might be extended to include family as well as furniture. 

My philosopher, however, had his revenge on bailiffdom in due 
course, as will be seen later on. 

A year or so after the foregoing incident, which occurred in 
Melbourne, I was in Sydney lodging in the house of a friend, who 




BAILIFFS I HAVE MET. 275 

also described himself as a man of letters. He was, as a matter of 
fact, a reporter on one of the daily papers, but was endowed with 
tastes and aspirations far above his position. These found 
expression in speckled-green jars, papier-mache statuettes of classical 
shepherds and shepherdesses, vases of every size and shape, brackets, 
tables with spiral legs like crossed corkscrews, and other articles of 
virtu too numerous to mention. The front room of the little house 
in which he lived was so crowded with these things that it was 
seldom opened, except when his wife went in to dust them. He 
had also a library, contained in a carven bookcase with glass doors. 
It consisted of some forty or fifty volumes, works of the old 
dramatists. These were carefully numbered and catalogued, and it 
was (as Artemus Ward called the Tower of London) a Sweet Boon 
to me to see him, when he required a book, gravely refer to a small 
ledger, neatly lettered from A to Z on its outer edge, and then, 
having discovered the registered number of the volume, take the 
latter out of the bookcase with the air of a man who had found 
what he wanted on the shelves of the Bodleian or the Biblioth^ue 
Nationale. Of course, Simson (this was not my friend&apos;s real name, 
but it will answer quite as well for present purposes) could have put 
his hand upon the book at once, without going through this 
elaborate mummery, but that would not have been Simson&apos;s style. 
&quot; My father,&quot; he observed to me upon one occasion, &quot; always kept 
an index to the books in his library, and I do my best to follow in 
his footsteps. I haven&apos;t the number of books he had — his library 
contained several thousand volumes ; but I can, at least, have an 
index.&quot; This filial sentiment was expressed with so much dignity 
that I almost felt ashamed of myself for having laughed at the index. 
The true shrine of the Simson household, however, was the 
room in which was stored the gimcrackery previously referred to. 
Simson himself entered it but rarely, and then trod softly with 
slippered feet. I accused him once of going in there to worship in 
secret a hideous porcelain image of the Chinese dragon god which 
stood on the mantelpiece, but he merely smiled and said I was a 
hopeless Philistine. 



276 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

One morning I came downstairs and found the door of the 
ehrine open. I went in, half expecting to surprise Simson in the 
midst of some mysterious rite, but he was not there. There was 
somebody in the room, however. A man with tousled hair, a dirty- 
reddish beard, and a face that looked as if it had been (which was, 
no doubt, the fact) soaking in beer for years, was lying in a loose 
heap on the dainty green satin sofa, with one of his huge feet, 
encased in a broken blucher, resting carelessly on the glory of the 
shrine — a tall Japanese vase embellished with illustrations of the 
story of the Forty Ronins. I stared hard at the man, who winked 
familiarly at me with one bloodshot eye, and I walked out of the 
room, greatly wondering. In the dining-room I met Simson with 
hair on end, and eyes glaring wildly. &quot;Who&apos;s your friend?&quot; I 
asked, nodding in the direction of the front room. 

&quot; He &apos;s no friend of mine ! &quot; replied Simson, — and then a base 
inspiration seemed to come to him, for he added : &quot; He &apos;s the wife&apos;s 
uncle.&quot; 

Of course, the man was a bailiff. 

He had insisted on camping in the front room, because 
he saw that it contained all the really valuable articles in the 
house. 

I am glad to say that Simson managed to raise the money 
required to meet the ruffian&apos;s demand, and to get rid of him before 
he had been in the house more than a few hours. As it was, he left 
behind him an effluvium of stale alcohol which hung around the 
place for days afterwards. 

Two or three years passed without my making any further 
acquaintance with bailiifdom. And then it came about that I 
stopped one night at a house in Woolloomooloo, wherein dwelt a 
happy family, consisting of a poet, a piano-tuner, a professor of 
mathematics, and an artist who painted religious subjects 
preference, but, owing to lack of orders in this direction, paini 
panels of bar-screens and picturesque whisky advertisements for 
living. The house was taken in the name of the artist, he being 




BAILIFFS I HAVE MET. 277 

only member of the party who did any regular work. The piano- 
tuner came next in financial importance, but he was not a perfect 
character in other respects. When he earned a few shillings by 
tuning a piano, he often started to tune himself up with beer to 
such an extent that the artist, who was a fastidious person when not 
Ijimself intoxicated, always insisted on his sleeping in the wood-shed 
till he became sober again. As for the poet and the professor of 
mathematics, they also made a little money occasionally, — the poet 
by writing elegies and epitaphs — and the professor by &quot; coaching &quot; 
students for examinations. They brought home their money man- 
fully, and handed it over to the artist, who as manfully expended it 
in the purchase of liquor and tinned provisions for the use of the 
establishment. Taking them altogether, the happy family was the 
most genial set of Bohemians I have ever had the fortune to meet 
with. I do not even except the piano-tuner, as he made up 
for his periodical bouts by long spells of self-sacrificing total 
abstinence, and put the money he earned during these intervals into 
the common fund like a hero. If they had a fault at all it was that 
they were almost too convivial. They used to drink rum at break- 
fast, and bottled beer in cups at tea-time. 

Of course, a menage of this kind was too gay to last. The end 
came, as luck would have it, on the morning when I happened to be 
a guest of the household. I was awakened by hearing a sound of 
voices in the passage — the artist had made up a bed for me on the 
floor of the front room with newspapers, and had covered me, in the 
kindest manner, with one of his great historical cartoons, repre- 
senting the landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay, the paint upon 
which was alone sufficient to keep me warm, without taking the 
canvas into account. 

I knew at once what the trouble was — the bailiff was in 
possession. So far, however, he had not penetrated beyond the 
passage, and the artist, with a ring of pathos in his voice which 
revealed to me unsuspected depths of feeling in his nature, was 
imploring him not to take away the furniture without giving him 
(the artist) a chance to find the coin required, or, at any rate, to 



278 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

come to some arrangement v ith the landlord. (The distraint was, I 
may remark, about to be made for arrears of rent). 

&quot; Not me ! &quot; said the bailiff, a brutal miscreant bloated with 
intemperance ; &quot; I &apos;m not that kind of bloomin&apos; goat. Fork out 
the coin at once or I clean out the furnicher.&quot; 

&quot; Heartless wretch ! &quot; exclaimed the artist, turning away with 
a choking sob, &quot;do your worst ! &quot; 

The bailiff, signing to his assistant to remain in the passage — 
a wily precaution against any of the furniture being removed on the 
sly — went through the house to take an inventory of its contents. 

He had not been gone five minutes before he was back in 
the passage again, cursing and blaspheming in a most shocking 
style. 

&quot; What &apos;s the matter ! &quot; his assistant asked. 

&quot; This is what &apos;s the matter ! &quot; he replied bitterly, kicking a 
table made out of an old packing-case into the passage — &quot;this is 
the kind of thing they have the blanky cheek to call furnicher. 
Why, s &apos;elp me gawd, there is n&apos;t enough in the whole place to pay 
our blanky fees ! &quot; 

It was so. Every article of furniture in the house was literally 
home-made out of palings, packing-cases, and pieces of old deal 
board, picked up from time to time by the artist and his friends. 

I then appreciated the full burlesque significance of the pathetic 
appeal made to the bailiff with regard to sparing the furniture. 

&quot; I am glad to see,&quot; observed the artist by way of a parting 
shot, &quot; that your better feelings have prevailed, and that you intend 
to leave me my little household treasures.&quot; 

The bailiff scowled horribly, and went away threatening unutter- 
able things. 

&quot; We shall have to move now, boys,&quot; said the artist, addressing 
the others ; &quot;we can&apos;t stand off the landlord any more on the 
strength of our furniture.&quot; 

I have said that my philosopher ultimately had his revenge on 
bailiffdom. I was on the spot when the revenge was consummated, 



BAILIFFS I HAVE MET. 279 

having occasion to call on the philosopher with reference to some &apos;^ 
impracticable scheme peculiarly in his line. There was a van in 
front of the door, into which a vanman was piling tables, chairs, 
washstands, bedsteads, and other articles of domestic use. The &apos; 
philosopher, in his shirt-sleeves, and with beads of perspiration 
rolling down his intellectual forehead, was vigorously assisting. 

&quot; Lend a hand here ! &quot; he exclaimed, as he caught sight of me. 

I followed him into the house and saw, lying on a sofa, snoring 
stertorously, a man who looked like Simson&apos;s wife&apos;s uncle. 

&quot; Take hold of his head ! &quot; said my philosopher. 

I took hold of his head. The philosopher grasped him by 
the feet. 

&quot; Now, lay him gently down on the floor — steady ! &quot; 

We laid him on the floor. The movement did n&apos;t awake the 
sodden ruflfian, who simply turned over on his side, and grunted 
drunkenly. 

&quot; Now, take hold of one end of the sofa and we &apos;11 run it into 
the van.&quot; 

Which was accordingly done. 

The house was now empty of anything in the shape of furniture. 
My philosopher, after placing a bottle of beer by the head of the 
unconscious man in possession, locked the front door and threw the 
key through the window into the front room. 

&quot; I don&apos;t pretend to be a practical man, but I think I managed 
that little affair pretty well,&quot; he remarked, making a sign to the 
vanman to drive on. 

&quot; How did you do it ? &quot; I enquired. 

&quot; Well, I happened to meet the bailiff on his way down to the 
house. I knew who he was, and where he was going. I also knew 
he could n&apos;t refuse a drink to save his life, and so I took him into 
a hotel, with the result you have seen. He knew me as a man of 
letters, but did n&apos;t know my name or that I lived in the house we 
have just left. I could n&apos;t make him stay in the hotel, however. 
Drunk as he was he had still a muddled idea of responsibility, seeing 
which I offered to accompany him, and brought a flask of rum with 



280 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

me to *top off with.&apos; He topped off with it, and the moment he 
sat down on the sofa where you saw him he went to sleep like the 
debauched beast he is. For all that, I had to leave him something to 
recover upon. Nohlesse oblige^ you know — even in dealing with a 
bailiff. He&apos;ll be glad to find that bottle of beer when he wakes.&quot; 

I have met other bailiffs since then, and the result of my 
experience is that, as I said in the beginning of this article, the 
worst use to which you can put a man is to make him a bailiff.

THREE CUPS OF TEA. 

WE tumbled across him in the nor&apos;-west corner of If^w ^ 

. South ■■ Wal e a. He was not what you might call a 
rouseabout. He seemed a decent sort of fellow, and his 
name was Good ; but he astonished us when he said he did n&apos;t 
like tea. 

&quot;Not like tea?&quot; spluttered old Packer. &quot;You&apos;re not fool 
enough to drink the soup they call water here ? &quot; 

&quot; Sometimes I boil it,&quot; replied Good. &quot; Sometimes, if it &apos;s extra- 
smelly, I boil it and put wood-ashes in it ; then I strain it through 
a handkerchief.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; said Jim Bride, enigmatically, &quot;wot doesn&apos;t fatten 
fills. If I &apos;d strained some of the post-and-rail tea I &apos;ve seen there 
would n&apos;t be much left to drink.&quot; 

One evening, when a common danger drew all our party 
together in human friendliness and Time weighed leaden hours, 
Good told us why he did n&apos;t drink tea. 

&quot; I had as good a claim on Flying Pig Hill as a man wants ; 
and, though I lived pretty freely, I managed to put by a few notes. 
I reckoned to buy a farm down in Gippsland and take things easy. 
I lived in a hut right on my claim ; but I boarded at old Ching 
Foo&apos;s, because I hated cooking for myself. 

&quot;Old Ching Foo kept a straight enough house, and he treated 
me real well. He would yarn away sometimes as if I was a relation 
of his ; and once or twice he gave me a nip of the best brandy I ever 
tasted. 

&quot; One night, when I &apos;d had a glass or two and was a bit excited- 
like because the claim was doing so well, Ching Foo said to me, 

281 



282 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

* You come along my house ; I got something I show. You not tell 
any other fellow ; I say when go.&apos; 

&quot; It was dark when we started, but Ching Foo seemed to know 
the road all right, and I followed him. I don&apos;t know which way we 
went, but we did n&apos;t walk more than a mile when we struck a house, 
and Ching Foo took me in. He put me down in a snug chair in a 
room where one or two lights burned softly, and there was a curious 
tea-ey smell. Ching Foo left me ; then the lights went up gradually, 
and in came Ching Foo again, but he was dressed differently. He 
had on a blue, shiny coat and loose white pants, and his pigtail 
hung down like a rope. 

&quot; We walked into another room, and there we had dinner. 
Not a boarding-house feed ; but curried fowl, all sorts of vegetables, 
and such puddings as I &apos;d never tasted before. After dinner we 
had cigars ; and then a young woman — a little, slim creature with 
a veil over her face — brought in some tea, and I drank it. Now, 
that was tea. The smell of it seemed to send one into a kind of 
dream, and the taste of it made the dream as nice as a dream could 
be. I saw old Ching Foo smiling away ; then he handed me the 
box of cigars and said : &apos; You smoke these ; velly good. I smoke 
pipe &apos; — and I knew by the old fellow&apos;s face that he was going to 
take his opium. 

&quot; I was in a most inexpressibly comfortable mood — perhaps the 
whisky I &apos;d had in the afternoon might have softened me a bit, but 
it was that tea that seemed to set me off. The girl entered with 
another cup. She came close against me, and there seemed to be a 
sort of magnetism in her. When she took the saucer she seemed to 
touch my knee, and I declare that touch made me feel as if I &apos;d 
known her all my life and had been in love with her since I could 
remember. She was dressed in something thin and soft ; something 
that showed her rounded shoulders and bust. Lord, the very sight 
of her was enough to make a fellow feel drunk ! She thought I &apos;d 
finished my tea, and stooped over me to take the cup ; and then — I 
swear I could n&apos;t help it — I slid the cup to the floor and put my 
arms round her. She did n&apos;t draw back ; she seemed to think that 



THREE CUPS OF TEA. 283 

I &apos;d a right to do it. She snuggled softly against me ; then she 
somehow dropped her veil and I saw her face. It was such 
a face as I &apos;d never seen before, and I suppose I shall never 
see again. It was white as milk, and small, and her eyes were 
beautiful as — as . . . and they looked into mine, and I stooped 
down and kissed her. She whispered &apos; Are you afraid of Ching 
Foo?&apos; and I laughed low. As if I&apos;d be afraid of anybody 
then ! 

&quot; * Afraid of him ! &apos; said I. 

&quot; &apos; O hush ! &apos; she said ; &apos; be quiet, or he will come.&apos; 

&quot; I kept quiet, for I had my arms around her, and I did n&apos;t 
want to move ever again. The whole thing seemed like a dream, 
but I knew it was real. Such a dainty little figure, and her skin as 
soft and white as a flower. 

&quot; There was a slight sound, and in a moment she was out of my 
arms and had disappeared. 

&quot; Ching Foo came in, and we had a yarn. I told him what the 
claim was yielding, and pretty well all the best side of my affairs ; 
and he just nodded his head. 

&quot; Three nights after that Ching Foo asked me to go home with 
him again, and I jumped at the chance. It was just the same as 
before. The room with the lights — the same sort of dinner, the 
wonderful cup of tea, then Ching Foo taking his opium — then the 
girl coming in again. She and I drank the tea together. She sat by 
my side as close as close could be. I kissed her soft, little mouth 
and her hair — I could have kept on kissing her all my life, and 
wanted nothing better to do. We did n&apos;t talk much, but she asked 
me my name, and she got me to write it down on a bit of paper, and 
when I wrote it she kissed me and slipped away. Then Ching Foo 
came in. 

&quot;I fished for another invitation, but old Ching Foo didn&apos;t 
savee my hints until one day he asked me to lend him ten pounds, 
and said he &apos;d give me security on a section of land he owned, and, 
as he could n&apos;t write, he got Tom Abner and Jerry Brash to witness 
his mark. As he signed it, he whispered, &apos; You satisfy take tea 



284 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

alonga me, to-night ? &apos; and I said, * You bet I &apos;m satisfied, and 
devilish glad to get it.&apos; 

&quot;Old Ching Foo said low -like to me, &apos;You sign paper, too/ 
I was going to tell him that there was no occasion for me to sign, 
but he seemed to know what was in my mind, and looked sulky, and 
I was thinking of the chance of seeing that girl, so I signed just 
to please him, and he laughed like a happy boy. 

&quot; It came again — room, dinner, cigars, the cup of tea, and — and 
my girl. She seemed to come straight to my arms, and I held 
her fast. 

&quot; I drank the cup of tea at a gulp when I found she would not 
share it. It tasted a bit bitter, being a trifle strong. I wonder 
how I remember this, for I had her in my arms before the cup was 
well out of my hands. Her dark hair was loosened and hung down 
in long, wavy lines ; her veil lay on the floor. I looked into her 
eyes, she looked into mine ; then her lips seemed to come to mine, 
her arms went round my neck. . . . Poof ! folks may talk about 
opium and that stufi*; but that girl was real. Could I remember it 
all so well after so many years 1 No, I held her, and I don&apos;t want 
heaven to be any better than that ; and it lasted — was it an hour 
or a second ? . . . 

&quot; When I came to myself I was in a stinking little hovel that 
some Chinese gardeners used to own, and when Tom Abner saw me 
he said, * Well, I &apos;m blamed ! Why, it &apos;s town-talk that you had 
bought Ching Foo&apos;s section and had gone down to Melbourne to 
float a big thing in mines.&apos; 

&quot; When I went to the township I found that Ching Foo had 
presented a cheque signed by me at the bank, and had drawn out 
all my money. Tom Abner and Jerry Brash had seen me sign the 
transfer, and had heard me say that it was all right, and that I was 
satisfied. 

&quot; Well, and I was satisfied. Ching may have got at me badly ; 
but I &apos;d pay twice as much — aye, a hundred times as much, if I 
had it — for another meeting with that girl.&quot;

SILHOUETTES. 



MY HORSE. 

I OWN a tall, domesticated horse of the semi-angular type of beauty. 
He has an open countenance, a hollow back, and an expressive hazel 
eye. A former owner of the horse removed the other eye. This 
person was vexed and mortified because he could not catch the 
horse, and in the heat of the debate assaulted the animal with a 
gun. The horse has been sceptical about the trustworthiness of 
human nature ever since. I have owned him for a long time now, 
but I have not yet won his entire confidence. His name is Parkes. 

He associates with a number of illiterate quadrupeds that roam 
the bush here, and they all regard Parkes as their chieftain. When 
any member of the mob finds a patch of couch-grass, Parkes 
depresses his ears and sidles alongside with a sour look. If the 
animal knows Parkes he goes away. But if he stays there, Parkes 
bites his neck and kicks him until he does adjourn. Then my horse 
eats the grass in a thoughtful way, and afterwards gets another 
horse to reverse ends with him, and whisk the flies off with his tail. 
But Parkes does not whisk for the other horse. He is too languid. 

Many people think it is easy to catch Parkes, but they are 
wrong. They are deceived by the statuesque attitude he assumes 
when another horse is being caught. But when you approach 
Parkes with a bridle, he smiles satirically and goes away quite 
rapidly. That is, if you have only a bridle. But if you have a tin 
dish of corn, he takes the corn with him. He gets it by degrees 
from your hand, and when you grab for his front hair he ducks and 
cross-counters with his front paws. He is very quick with his left. 

Last winter I made a rug for Parkes with two flour-bags and a 



286 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

clothes-line. He was pleased with the effect, and at once struck up 
an intimacy with a neighbour&apos;s cow, although before that he was a 
very bashful horse in female society. 

The neighbour&apos;s cow&apos;s name is Mike. Her owner was facetious 
and named her Mike Howe. But (he is dead now) I am told he 
was otherwise a most estimable man, and a model husband and 
father. 

Mike and my horse became very affectionate, and my horse got 
quite vain and haughty, because of the distinguished look the rug 
gave him. But one day, when he was trying to help Mike&apos;s calf 
into a lucerne paddock, the rug became disarranged. The ropes 
straddled his back, and the main body of the rug clung confidingly 
to his abdomen. When he next called on Mike, she received my 
horse coldly. He was hurt at this, and came home to me to have 
his garb refitted ; but I took it off and made it into a meat-safe. 

Mike never afterwards associated with my horse. She even 
pretended that she did not recognise him, and dropped his 
acquaintance altogether. Her cruelty broke my horse&apos;s heart, and 
he has never since recovered his old gaiety of spirit. He pushed 
Mike&apos;s calf down a shaft last week ; but he is still gloomy and 
abstracted. 

I think his disposition is permanently soured.

HANGING AND HELL. 

There are at least six Hanging Rocks and three Gallows Hills in 
New South Wales. There is one Hell. I &apos;ve been there, thus : 

Assize time in Wagga Wagga and a man on trial for murder. 
Another man, myself, on trial of sobriety, dead broke, hat battered, 
boots unlaced, swag all no-how, and so nervous that the gambolling 
of Pop scares me. Funny that that animal is never so delighted as 
when I shoulder bluey. I pass the court-house ; a knot of idlers 
are round the gate, a policeman comes out and says, &quot; They &apos;11 hang 



SILHOUETTES. 287 

him ! &quot; I &apos;m off like a shot, and in my ears the din of &quot; Hang him, 
hangin&apos;, hangin&apos;, hang, &apos;ang, &apos;ng — ng — ng ! &quot; Then I turn a corner 
to get out of public gaze. Unluckily, I pass the side door of the 
building. I am spell-bound ; there I see an awful visage, a face 
with such a ghastly mouth, and such a dress below the mouth, for 
the mouth has taken charge of the face, like the Cheshire Cat&apos;s grin 
in Wonderland. Then the grin and the hair, the mouth and the 
gown, the words and the black cap take me by the shoulders and 
elsewhere and hustle me on to the river bank. &quot; Hang, hang, 
hang — ng — ng ! &quot; and now I &apos;ve got them. I know they &apos;re on me 
and so does Pop, because he whines and fawns on me. But for Pop 
I &apos;d have shown the horrors. Now I only feel them. 

Then I walk and walk and walk. It seems two days, but it &apos;s 
not so wearisome, because I have music, — that rhythm, you know, 
always in my ears. It &apos;s company if it &apos;s horrible, and the dog is 
some consolation. Next, I find myself by a vineyard full of 
angels ; they give me three tumblers of wine and a bottle for 
the road. They wish me to stay, and see me through my 
recovery, but — that grin, that mug, that wig, and the little black 
cap ! I &apos;m off. 

Again I travel about a week, in my mind&apos;s eye, and camp near 
an old shed under a tree. There &apos;s a paling fence near, and it looks 
like the bars of a cage or prison. 

But the tree — the gallows-tree ! The boughs are scraggy, and 
the leaves white on top ; there &apos;s a break in the middle, and a guard 
round the barrel. It looks like that head. The gap is the 
cavernous mouth, and the soughing of the breeze is &quot; Hang him, 
they &apos;11 hang him ! &quot; 

Still, I &apos;m not so badly off. I can see an angel or two feeding 
Pop. A man comes down with a pint of tea and a plate of soup. 
He tells me this is the &quot; Burnt Hut,&quot; and that the fires are HeU. 
Just then he &apos;s called by the overseer, and says &quot; Hang him !&quot; Now 
I &apos;m off again. The din begins, the tree shivers, the head wags, the 
mug mutters, some crows perch on the top and make a black cap, 
and I fall asleep near the paling fence — the prison cage. 



288 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

When I wake I look through. I see Pop, watching my swag 
on the other side, and a man tieing the legs of a sheep. That sheep 
is, to me, myself. He skins it, and calls to his mate, &quot; Come and 
help me to hang him ! &quot; The wretch is going to hang me, the same 
good fellow who gave me the soup. Luckily, I spot the bottle of 
wine. I reach for it and drink it, holding the bottle by the neck. 
I know that I am being hung — hanged, I mean ; but I &apos;m not going 
to let them touch me, myself, the &quot; alter ego.&quot; They come near me 
and fetch the overseer, who brings me a nip of the real Mackay. It 
is now a little funny : I &apos;m hung, and still drinking whisky, 
and the hangman isn&apos;t so bad. I suppose the overseer&apos;s the 
devil, because he says, in a sort of pitying tone, &quot; Well ! is n&apos;t 
this hell?&quot; 

Another snooze, and I awake. It ought to be dark, but it 
is n&apos;t. The night is lit up by bush-fires on and around a pinnacle of 
smoke and flame. We can see the timbers falling, the sparks rising. 
&quot; We &quot; are the men and I. I can see the wig and the mouth and 
the grin and the corpse, standing out like red lights on a murky 
background. A calico shroud has been tied round the sheep, and it 
now looks like a suspended ghost. I fancy its soul has gone to — 
well, blazes was my thought. Then I become sure of it, because the 
overseer — the devil, I mean — calls the men to look at the Hanging 
Rock, the pillar of fire, and tells them or half asks them, &quot; Is n&apos;t 
it hell ? &quot; What with the Hanging and the Hell, I start again 
(mentally), and have my little song of &quot; Hang him, hang him, hell, 
&apos;ell, well — not so bad — hang — hell &apos;&quot; 

And I awoke ; and behold, it was a dream. &quot; Well, 
old fellow ! Are you better ? Can you cook ? Can have a 
job if you like. Only me and some fencers. We &apos;re out all day. 
Tackle it to-morrow. I&apos;ll give you a nip or two — I&apos;ve had &apos;em 
myself.&quot; 

But there are few overseers like the one who used to be at the 
Burnt Hut, under the Hanging Rock. &quot; Is n&apos;t it hell ? &quot;

THE SCHOOL AT SERGEANT&apos;S. 

Of all the small bush schools I ever had the misfortune to be in 
charge of, I think with least regret of the school at Sergeant&apos;s. 
And this, with other things, leads me to say that the experience of 
teachers does not vary so much with the schools as with the places 
they board at. Practically, the schools are alike — little wooden 
boxes with iron roofs — cold as Kiandra in winter and hot as 
Booligal in summer. Nowadays the buildings are even more uniform 
— built to style, as it were ; but in my day the only difference was in 
the width of the cracks. The children are always the same (God 
forgive them !) ; the results never vary ; and the same loneliness 
pervades all. But the chief difference in the place you board at is 
that each is the worst. All except Sergeant&apos;s. 

Old Sergeant was one of the finest men I ever saw — six-feet- 
two at sixty-three ! A rugged and seamed old face, clean-shaven 
but for a fringe of white hair about his neck ; eyes clear as a child&apos;s ; 
and a mouth that expressed determination except when he was in 
company and could n&apos;t get rid of the superfluous saliva engendered 
by his inactivity. He was a rough old customer, with many quaint 
and truthful sayings — more or less concerning women, and more or 
less unprintable. But his veneration for his wife was almost 
pathetic. It showed in his speech. With a total disregard for 
grammar, it was, &quot; When me an&apos; Tom was on Lambing Flat,&quot; or 
&quot; The time me and Bill Wade was overlandin&apos;,&quot; — but every reference 
to her was &quot; Mother and me &quot;; and &quot; Was n&apos;t it, mother ? &quot; comprised 
half of his yarns. 

The family were all married ; and, in the long winter evenings, 
after my solitary tea — my mouth waters even now at the memory of 
those preserves — I would go into the kitchen and find the old 
woman knitting socks, and old Sergeant making picture-frames 
of fruit-stones and cones. A steaming glue-pot by his side, and 
pliers in his hand, he cracked the nuts and fitted the pieces with 
such minute care that to cover three square inches of frame was a 
long night&apos;s work. After a while, I drew designs for him to pick 



290 ^^^ BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

out with different kinds of stones, and even essayed one myself — 
which was picked to pieces in more ways than one. And then, in 
front of the log fire, he would tell stories of the old times, or I would 
play the fiddle. 

He would never let me play my best piece — &quot; Home, Sweet 
Home &quot; — because : &quot; When me and Tom was on Araluen — that was 
before mother and me took up, was n&apos;t it, mother ? — we got word that 
a great fiddler, called Something- Whisky, was comin&apos;. There was a 
bit of a hall at the pub., and me and Tom was often there, doin&apos; a bit 
of steppin&apos; and such. Me and Tom was counted the best steppers 
on the diggin&apos;s — leastways, Tom always played,&quot; he added, with 
characteristic modesty. &quot; Well, Whisky took the hall, and we all 
dressed up to take out our ten bobs&apos; worth ; and, my word ! there 
was a mixed crowd there — was n&apos;t there, mother 1 Well, Whisky 
came out, and as soon as he starts we could see he was a fine player ; 
but there was too much shakes and such for us. He ran up and 
down like winkin&apos; till big Tom M&apos;Grath — you remember Tom, 
mother 1 — stands up on a seat and says : * I move Jack Sergeant 
does a step. &apos; That was me ; and before old Whisky knew where he 
was I was at it. Whisky stood on one side pattin&apos; his fiddle and 
speakin&apos; some language to himself, while I gave a new step me and 
Tom had been practisin&apos; on the quiet. Well, of course, there was 
drinks ; but no one remembered old Whisky, till he ups and starts 
play in&apos; &apos;Home, Sweet Home,&apos; just plain like. Sometimes now, 
when I &apos;m lyin&apos; in bed, it comes to me ; don&apos;t it, mother ? Well, 
you never heard a lot of fellows cough and clear their throats like 
we did. After that we cleared the stage, and made him promise 
only to play plain tunes we knew, and then we all goes out and paid 
afresh to come in ; did n&apos;t we, mother ? &quot; 

When the old woman died I ofiered to move, but old Sergeant 
would n&apos;t hear of it. &quot; You stay along with me and we &apos;11 rub along 
— you was a favourite of hers.&quot; One night he selected one from a 
number of tombstone photographs and asked me to write the 
inscription. He looked over my shoulder and spelled the words as 



SILHOUETTES. 291 
I wrote &quot; Sacred to the memory of Jane, the beloved wife of &quot; 



Then he stopped me. &quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot; I asked. &quot; Well,&quot; he 
said, &quot;her and me was never properly married; best rub out wife 
and put helpmate. She was that — true — was n&apos;t you, mother ? &quot; 
said the old man dreamily. 

PONTE. 



THE BURIAL SERVICE OF fl MUSICIAN. 

We gathered around the open grave, ten of us, and gazed down 
silently at the plain deal colSBn. None of us knew any burial- 
service, but something of the sort seemed necessary, so we stood 
puzzling our brains to recall some good action of the deceased. 
After a lapse of several minutes Jones mentioned how the corpse 
had once treated Cornish Joe to a big burst. This had been 
better left unsaid ; for we all remembered that the sequel to that 
action was running through the traveller&apos;s pockets and abstracting 
the contents. 

There was another silence of five minutes while we moved our 
feet about, shuffling the loose earth into rude circles. Then Darby- 
shire whispered that perhaps if we sang something it would be 
better than keeping dead silence. There was no answer to 
Darbyshire&apos;s suggestion. 

By and by, Murphy could stand it no longer. &quot; Boys,&quot; he 
cried, &quot; d&apos; ye moind the toime he did Ginger Smith outer a pen at 
Gerogery ? A low, sneaking hound he was ! &quot; 

&quot; Ay, he was that,&quot; chipped in old M&apos;Dougall. &quot; Do ye no&apos; 
remember him saltin&apos; the South claim, too ? &quot; 

We all remembered it well. Our tongues were loosened at 
once, and each of us had some anecdote to relate of the perfidy of 
the departed. For an hour or more we stayed, until the pauses grew 
longer between the yarns, and ultimately conversation came to a 
stop. We shovelled in the earth and left a yellow mound to mark 



292 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK, 

the spot. Then we made tor the Miner&apos;s Arms to drink the corpse&apos;s 
health. 

&quot;Fill &apos;em up, mon,&quot; said M&apos;Dougall. &quot;He was a dom&apos;d 
scoundrel, but, my oath, he could play the Jew&apos;s harp ! &quot;

SELLING SCRIPTURE TEXTS. 

There are many different ways of making a living; but selling 
Scripture texts is not one of them. I discovered this in two days. 
A friend who frames pictures in Sydney gave me some nice little 
works of art with a passage of Scripture in one corner, and T started 
out to supply a long-felt want. I always thought that when people 
are up to their eyes in debt and trouble would be the right time to 
drop in with some nice little texts, setting forth that &quot;The Lord 
will provide,&quot; etc. It seems not. But I should have sold more if I 
had only known what part of the town the Christians live in. I &apos;m 
satisfied of that. As soon as I find that out I intend to make 
money. I met some queer people, though, for a person who does n&apos;t 
know the town. 

One of them is the woman who tells you, after a lot of talk, 
that she has a house-full of pictures — more than she has room to 
hang up ; and just then one of the children opens the door wide and 
you discover that the walls are perfectly bare, excepting here and 
there a large, red spot where some robust bed-insect paused abruptly. 
And I like the woman who opens the door and smiles. When you 
put your pictures down on the door-step and start to clear your 
throat, she slams the door and knocks your pictures right to the 
bottom of the steps. Your throat clears very suddenly just here, 
and you quote Scripture which is n&apos;t on the texts. This person 
always lives in a fine, big house, being a lady. 

After a few of these confidential interviews, I ceased to wonder 
how anarchists were built. I have a recipe which would make an 
anarchist of Job. If this meets the eye of any anarchist who wishes

to begin work in Sydney, I will be glad to point out some houses 
which I think could be blown to pieces conveniently, and at little 
cost. I hate to see any man out of work. 

Then there is the Salvation woman, who reads your texts over 
in a sacred voice as though afraid of stepping on her creed, and tells 
you to &quot; Remember what them says ! &quot; Every minute at that house 
is time heaved away. The Sunday-school teacher — ditto. I think 
a lot of the man who sits smoking his pipe on the back verandah, 
and, when you come to the side-gate and ask if that dog will bite, 
says, &quot;Sometimes.&quot; A second glance at the house convinces you 
that the people in there don&apos;t know a nice, neat picture when they 
see it. Consequently, they don&apos;t see it. 

I also met the man who said &quot; he got some of them Scripture 
things once, but the kids knocked &quot; — well, a very tropical place — 
&quot; out of them.&quot; Yes, I met some queer people. In fact, the only 
people I did n&apos;t meet were the people who wanted some nice little 
religious pictures. If the Apostle Paul were here now, he would 
soon knock off selling Scripture texts, and start out with &quot; The Life 
of the Kelly Boys,&quot; or &quot; Bushranging in Australia.&quot; Then he 
might make a living. 

Boiling Billy. 



&quot;COLONIAL EXPERIENCE.&quot; 

He was a good fellow — the boss liked him, the hands liked him : in 
fact, we all liked him. 

It was only eight months since he had come from England to 
Yowlahmine Station with a letter of recommendation to Mr. Foster, 
our boss. His name was Edward — Ted, we used to call him ; Ted 
Oscott. Nobody thought of calling him Mister now, except Maggie 
M&apos;Farlane. 

Maggie&apos;s father was the married man on the home station. 
Ted thought a lot of Maggie, and often used to sit with her under 



294 TEE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

the old fig-tree behind the store of a night and tell her about 
England and his people. 

One night he asked her why she did n&apos;t call him &quot; Ted &quot; and 
not &quot;Mister Oscott.&quot; She said she didn&apos;t like, as he might think 
her forward. Maggie was very shy. 

Ted thought he would change the conversation, so he asked her 
if she knew that Murphy was leaving. Murphy was one of the 
married boundary-riders. 

Maggie said she had heard her father saying something about 
it, and she was very glad if it was true ; because she never did like 
Murphy, and did n&apos;t want to see him any more — or his wife, either. 

Ted assured her that it was true, and the boss had offered 
the billet to him (Ted), remarking at the time that it would be a 
good chance for him to marry Maggie. 

Ted then drew a little closer, and asked her if he might tell 
Mr. Foster that he would take his offer. Maggie said she would see 
what her father said. 

Anyhow, it was soon arranged. They were to ride into 
Nerribong on Monday, get married and spend a few days, and then 
on Sunday ride home to Murphy&apos;s, where everything would be ready 
for them. 

Nerribong, Saturday night. Maggie had gone to bed, and Ted 
was paying Hennessy, the landlord, for the week&apos;s accommodation, 
when who should walk into the bar but Murphy ! Ted ordered 
drinks, and Murphy wished him luck and told him he had got 
another job, at Greendale, and was going out in the morning. 
Then they went to bed. 

When Ted walked into the yard next morning, two horses were 
hung up at the post, saddled. One was Murphy&apos;s ; the other the 
one that Maggie had ridden in from Yowlahmine. Murphy had 
brought them up from the paddock, but could n&apos;t find Ted&apos;s horse 
anywhere. Ted went to look for him, but with no success. 

When he came back Maggie was mounted and ready, and 
Murphy was pulling down the slip-rails to let her pass through. 



SILHOUETTES. 295 

Having got both horses outside, he carefully replaced the rails and 
bade Ted &quot; Good morning ! &quot; 

&quot; Wait a minute,&quot; says Ted. &quot; Where are you going ? &quot; 

&quot; Greendale,&quot; answers Murphy. 

&quot; She going with you ? &quot; 

&quot; Yes.&quot; 

&quot; Going to stay with you ? &quot; 

&quot;Yes.&apos; 

&quot; But where &apos;s your wife ? &quot; 

&quot; Left her at Yowlahmine — she expects you to-night.&quot; 

&quot; Ah, well,&quot; says Ted, &quot; you had better come and have a drink 
before you go. It &apos;s pretty sultry this morning.&quot; 

&quot; Going to have a hot day, I think,&quot; says Murphy. 

Ted thought so too. 

He was a good fellow — we all liked him. He has n&apos;t come 

back from Nerribong yet.

THE FERRYMAN. 

Mitchell stood six feet in his stockings. By the water&apos;s edge, the 
boat ; behind the shingle bed, the green turf ; on the turf, the 
cottage. Part dairyman, part stock-raiser, and a big lump digger — 
that is the ferryman. 

&quot; Familiarity breeds contempt.&quot; You see the mariner of 
thirty years lash the rope of the sail in its cleat. You see the 
engine-driver of ten years fall in a moment under the ponderous 
wheels of the locomotive. You watch the successful pilot of a 
hundred races thrown, dragged by the stirrup, and brained. Why 
should the ferryman be an exception 1 

Was it a river ? Yes, when it rained ; in fine weather it was 
only a creek. But then it often rained. At such times the water 
changed its colour and became a sour white. There is a caution in 
that which is fickle. 



296 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Like a million other streams, its destiny was the Pacific. 
Under cover of the clouds the sea found time to whisper as they 
embraced : 

&quot; I am thy mother — some children played upon the shore to-day 
— I coveted them, but the tide was spent. Bring me a corpse of 
man to make me sport.&quot; 

And the river promised. 

That night the sky was filled with silver cords. It was the 
rain. The river gurgled and rose. Mitchell took his lantern at ten 
o&apos;clock, and went to see to his boat. He found water all round it. 

The river eyed him cunningly. The boat never warned him. 
Below the boat was a recent eddy — breathless, triumphant. It had 
but that minute torn a huge hole in the shingle. 

Putting the lantern on the bank, Mitchell stepped into the 
water to drag the boat further up the beach. He clutched the gun- 
wale, and felt that his feet were drawn right under. At the same 
instant the boat began to pay out broadside down the stream. 

Mitchell opened his mouth to cry for help. That attempted 
appeal was his death-warrant, swimmer though he was. In an 
instant his head went under. 

The water poured down his throat. In fancy he felt his 
mother gently stroking his cheek. He loosed his grasp of the boat. 
When he rose, the power to struggle was for ever gone. 

Mitchell&apos;s wife took the tin lamp, and, with her daughter, went 
in quest of her husband. The other children crowded in the door- 
way. The lantern still burned, but it rested on the stones. Where 
were the hands that had brought it there ? 

&quot; Coo-ee I &quot; 

No answer. 

« Coo-ee-ee I &quot; 

Silence is a mocker. 

The river was too high to cross to the township, but one of the 
boys rode five miles down the bank to a neighbour&apos;s place for 
counsel and assistance. There is sublimity in the compulsory 
craving for sympathy at such a time.

Ex-lieutenant Hamborough, once a soldier, now a beachcomber, 
rubbed his huge hands with satisfaction. The sea had been rough. 
There was a fine flat of sand with a bank of six feet at high-tide 
mark. All night had the sea sluiced those tons of stuff. 

He reckoned twenty ounces at least. 

He took his box with its plush and blanket ripples and sallied 
out. Gold sticks in hair. Maybe that is how woman first learned 
to feed vanity from effect. 

Descending the bank, he began to shovel the useful sand into 
heaps. 

He stopped, for the shovel struck a portion of flesh. He bored 
more. It was a man&apos;s back. He uncovered the lot, and identified 
it easily. It was his old friend, Mitchell, who had fought by his 
side at Cawnpore. And the knots of twenty years worn into the 
rope with which he had carried his box were easier to unravel than 
the wherefore of this strange meeting arranged by Fate. 

Do not play at hazards with danger ; keep well on the upper 

side.

BARMY BARKER&apos;S BOOTS. 

You see, Barmy Barker was once trampin&apos; the roads. He was 
always forgettin&apos; himself and was half his time bushed. He 
was awful absent-minded, was Barker. For instance, he&apos;d get 
up in the mornin&apos; and would n&apos;t know no more &apos;n the man in the 
moon which way he &apos;d been goin&apos; the night afore, and ten to one 
he &apos;d go back t&apos; where he &apos;d come from. He &apos;ad n&apos;t gumption 
enough to beat about and track himself. He &apos;d no idea of anythink 
barrin&apos; straight ahead to nowhere in particular. Wliat he was goin&apos; 
for— he did n&apos;t know. Once he scorned the offer of a good billet, 
when he was downright &apos;ard-up for one. It came o&apos; bein&apos; &apos;ead-over- 
ears in some big scheme or other in his mind. 

Often as not he &apos;d go to stations with his tucker-bags and come 



298 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

away with nothin&apos;. Could n&apos;t recollect what took him up, and 
forgot his bags thinkin&apos; of it. Then he &apos;d &apos;ave to ante-up a bob to a 
blackfellow to show him where he left his swag. When it come to 
payin&apos;, Barker &apos;d say, quite innocent, &quot; Do I owe you a shillin&apos; : 
what was it for, now 1 I can&apos;t think.&quot; &quot; Me find um swag.&quot; &quot; But 
that &apos;s my swag. I put it there.&quot; &quot; Das right, boss. You been 
lose um camp, see?&quot; Barker &apos;d barney over that for an hour 
sometimes, but he &apos;d stump up at last. He lost a mint o&apos; money 
that way. 

Anyhow, ratty as he was, he hit on a good plan to steer by. 
When he &apos;d come to his campin&apos;-place he &apos;d take his boots off, and 
leave &apos;em pointin&apos; the right way. Then he could twist about as 
much as he liked takin&apos; his swag off, and makin&apos; preparations in 
gen&apos;ral for the night. Till them boots was right, though, he 
darsn&apos;t turn, or he &apos;d be flabbergasted altogether. .In the mornin&apos; 
everything must be shouldered for the track &apos;fore he dare step into 
&apos;em. Otherwise he might get turned pickin&apos; up something. He did 
go without &apos;em wonst, and it was n&apos;t till he &apos;d picked forty or so 
thorns out o&apos; his feet it occurred to him he was in the &apos;abit o&apos; wearin&apos; 
boots. A trav&apos;ler fetched &apos;em along for him that time. 

One night he &apos;ad to get up and go to the waterhole for a drink. 
That was the turnin&apos;-point in his life. He put his boots on — it 
bein&apos; the time snakes go picnickin&apos; and matin&apos; ; and there &apos;s nothin&apos; 
in the wide world that sets Barker&apos;s hair standin&apos; on end more &apos;n 
snakes. 

When he got up next day the boots was facin&apos; the waterhole. 

&quot; Dang it ! &quot; says Barker ; &quot; I did n&apos;t know I &apos;ad to cross that ! &quot; 

But the boots pointed that way, so there was no get out of it. 
It was only fifty yards round that hole, but leather said cross it, 
and &apos;cross it went Barker — up to his neck. He felt miserable when 
he got out, for Barker was n&apos;t used to bein&apos; wet. So he stripped off 
to dry. When he was ready to start ag&apos;in he found his compass &apos;ad 
gone bung once more. One boot pointed east, t&apos; other west. &quot; Now, 
which way ami goin&apos; 1 &quot; says Barker. He sat down to think it 
out. Bat it was n&apos;t no use. Thinkin&apos; made him giddy, and put 



SILHOUETTES. 299 

him in such a gen&apos;ral muddle that he lost sight o&apos; what he wanted 
to think about. So he saw there was no help then but to wait till 
some one came along. 

So Barker filled his pipe. He &apos;ad n&apos;t &apos;ad a smoke that mornin&apos;, 
and his mouth was waterin&apos;. Soon he was puffin&apos; away big licks, 
and found it a good help to his brain. So he tried ag&apos;in to think 
them boots the one way, and finished up with bandicootin&apos; murphies 
in the old country. He was that disgusted that he grabbed the old 
clay-dabber to knock the ashes out, and then he saw as he &apos;d never 
lit it. Barker saved a lot o&apos; &apos;bacca in his time forgettin&apos; the match 
part o&apos; the performance. 

As luck &apos;appeiied, a stockman came in sight about dinner-time. 
Barker cooeyed, and he came over. &quot; &apos;Scuse me,&quot; says Barker; 
&quot; would you do me a favor, mate ? I &apos;m a bit flummoxed.&apos;&gt;&quot; Certainly, old man — if it &apos;s not too much trouble. What is it ? &quot; 
&quot; Ah, what is it ? Lemme see — Oh ! . . . Will you tell me where 
I &apos;m goin&apos; to, and oblige — yours sincerely &quot;... Barker was workin* 
it off on his fingers. 

&quot; Why, strike me dead ! &quot; says the stockman to himself, &quot; that 
bloomin&apos; old fool &apos;s mad ! &quot; 

&quot; Where am I goin&apos; ? &quot; asks Barker again. 

&quot; OS yer nanny,&quot; says the stockman, riding off. &quot; Keep straight 
on, and you &apos;11 not be long afore you &apos;re there.&quot; 

Barker chewed that over for an hour. One boot said east and 
one said west. Which was straight on t &quot; Dang me if I don&apos;t go 
with Bobindie,&quot; says Barker — he called one of them boots Bobindie. 
So he put Bobindie on and went west. That night he struck a dry 
gully, and near perished for want of water. &quot; You &apos;re the devil&apos;s 
own,&quot; says Barker. &quot; To blazes with you ! &quot; 

He got back next night — how, I dunno — and he says to the 
other boot, that he called Brian Boroo : &quot; Brian,&quot; he says, &quot; we &apos;11 go 
east at your wish, and the Lord strike you blind if your designs be 
treacherous ! &quot; So he put on Brian Boroo and went east, leaving 
Bobindie to perish. He &apos;d &apos;ave no more truck with that gentleman. 

In three hours Brian Boroo kicked ag&apos;in a slug o&apos; gold, and 



300 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

Barker danced and howled in his delight. Before sundown he 
struck this one-&apos;orse place where I &apos;m treed now. But in Barker&apos;s 
eyes, with that slug shining in &apos;em, this miserable old creek was 
Heaven. So here he stuck. He was offered a tidy sum afterwards 
by a shindykit in the township to show &apos;em the spot where Brian 
hit the slug ; but, Lor&apos; bless you ! by that time Barker knew as much 
of its whereabouts as a gorilla. 

Anyway, he took the old blucher off, and knelt down &apos;fore the 
&apos;ouses and kissed him. &quot; Brian Boroo,&quot; says Barker, &quot; you &apos;re a 
brick ! &quot; So he pensioned him off straight away, and — well, there &apos;s 
the old fellow, snug and comfortable, in that glass case.

THE BENEFIT OF CLERGY. 

As Father Connolly reached the door of the Squatters&apos; Rest a dozen

&quot; Faith, hot &apos;s no name for it, Mrs. Dargan. Is there anny- 
thing left in moi bottle 1 &quot; 

&quot;Well, it&apos;s close on four months since ye was here, yer

&quot; No. Oi &apos;ve a sick-call at Bull-bull Station, and Oi must start

&quot; Indade ! And what moight it be ? &apos;* 



SILHOUETTES. 301 

&quot; Well, father, there &apos;s Mary. She be near her time to Ted 
Hogan, at Howlong ; an&apos; they wants joinin&apos;.&quot; 

&quot; Call &apos;em in, mother ! &quot; 

Mrs. Dargan went out of the parlour, and soon came back 
followed by Mary and her lover, a hard-faced young boundary-rider, 
who, fortunately for himself and the object of his affections, had 
ridden over to the Squatters&apos; Rest that morning. 

&quot;So!&quot; said the priest, sternly, &quot;so! ye &apos;ve not had the 
dacency to wait moi comin&apos; ? &quot; 

The young couple made no reply. 

&quot; How do ye expect to obtain a blessin&apos;,&apos;&apos; continued the priest, 
&quot; whin ye stale the joys of matrimony widout God&apos;s lave ? 
Kneel down, the pair of ye ! Now, say the worrds afther me. Mrs. 
Dargan, call all hands in as witnesses ! &quot; 

For some minutes the ceremony proceeded ; then the priest 
asked, &quot; Mary O&apos;Neill, do ye take this man for your husband 1 &quot; 

&quot; Yer ain&apos;t asked &apos;im if &apos;e &apos;11 &apos;ave me first, father.&quot; 

&quot;Soilence, you hussy! Will* you have him? He is going to 
marry you.&quot; 

&quot; Yes, yer reverence.&quot; 

&quot; That &apos;s roight. There now ! ye are man and woife, and God 
bless ye ! &quot; 

&quot; Whisky all round, mother ! &quot; cried Ted Hogan ; and all joined 
in the toeist which followed. 

&quot; Is there anny thing else now, Mrs. Dargan ? &quot; asked the 
priest, pocketing the pound-note given him by the newly-wedded 
man. 

&quot;Yes, yer riverince ; there &apos;s a baptism.&apos;* 

&quot; Whose is the infant ?&quot; 

« It &apos;s Jane&apos;s, father.&quot; 

&quot; Jane ! She &apos;s not married ! &quot; 

&quot; Ah ! poor thing, father, she &apos;s in a bad way, an&apos; her man 
won&apos;t be here this side Christmas.&quot; 

&quot;Whoishe?&quot; 

&quot; Alick M&apos;Intyre, the buUocky.&quot; 



302 THE BULLETIN STORY BOOK. 

&quot; Heavens ! the sin, the sin of it all ! Fetch the mother and 
choild in at onoe.&quot; 

A pale young woman was brought in, bearing in her arms a 
fine little boy a month or two old. 

&quot; Ah ! Jane, you &apos;ve been in a divil of a hurry,&quot; said the priest, 
not unkindly. &quot; Who stand sponsors for this choild ? God bless him ! 
He &apos;s a beauty, too.&quot; 

A toothless old rabbiter in for a spree, and a young fellow from 
a neighbouring selection, stepped forward, and the ceremony was 
soon over. 

&quot; There, Jane, me gurrl, the little wan is as pure as snow 
now. But what &apos;s all those tears for ? Mrs. Dargan, what &apos;s 
wrong ? &quot; 

The women-folk, as if by magic, had all begun to sob ; and the 
men stood here and there conversing in whispers and looking very 
glum. 

&quot;Come now, mother, what &apos;s the maning of it all ?&quot; asked the 
priest again, and impatiently this time. 

&quot; Ah, father, there &apos;s pretty Nellie yet ! &quot; 

** An&apos; what, in heaven&apos;s name, is wrong with her % — the angel of 
the flock. The pride of the Big Gum Plain. The flower among so 
many weeds.&quot; 

There was a ring of alarm in the old man&apos;s tones, and he looked 
anxiously from one to the other. 

&quot; Faith, father, it &apos;s buryin&apos; she wants.&quot; 

&quot; Burying 1 Nellie dead ! No, no. So bright, so fair. The 
queen of you all ! Not dead ! &quot; 

&quot;Indade, father.&quot; 

&quot; Take me to her ! &quot; 

&quot; She &apos;s all nicely laid out ; with a pretty coflGin, too, made by 
Ted, here. The poor lamb died yester-morn.&quot; 

Mrs. Dargan led the priest into an adjoining room where, on a 
stretcher, lay the body of poor Nellie. She had been a very 
beautiful girl, and even Death could not rob her perfect features of 
their charm. The long golden hair had been carefully brushed and 



SILHOUETTES. 303 

trained down each side of the reclining figure. On her breast was 
a bunch of wild flowers. 

&quot; She &apos;s bin ailin&apos; since your last visit, father. The young 
gentleman from Mooraboo run was after her, and Nellie was very 
fond of him. But the damn blackguard, savin&apos; your presence, father, 
wint away an&apos; got spliced to a lady in Adelaide, an&apos; our girl here 
broke her poor heart an&apos; died.&quot; 

Mrs. Dargan told her tale with many sobs. 

&quot; And was she innocent, do you think, mother ? &quot; asked the 
priest, anxiously. 

&quot; More &apos;s the pity, no, father. She &quot; 

&quot; God, God ! The sin, the sin ! Poor lamb, to be wrecked by 
that son of the devil. Wait until Oi meet him ! — which, plase 
Heaven, will be soon. Now bring all hands in, Mrs. Dargan, and 
Oi &apos;11 say prayers.&quot; 

And when the prayer was over he spoke to them about the 
savage way they were living, and said the back-blocks should be 
called the Black-blocks, for there was no light there. An hour later, 
after Nellie&apos;s body had been placed in the rough grave prepared for 
it, Father Connolly took his leave of the shanty and its inmates, 
blessing them all from his seat in the saddle. And as he rode away 
a tear trickled down his face. &quot;Lord!&quot; he cried, &quot;when will 
women know men ? &quot;

Lawson, Henry Archibald (&quot; Joe Swallow&quot;) ; literary writer. Born on the

father was Peter Hertzberg Larsen, a Norwegian ; his mother Louisa 
Albury (of English yeoman stock), a native of Guntawang, near Mudgee, 
N.S.W. (Thus Lawson&apos;s name is really Larsen ; but the Anglicised form 
appears to have been nearly always used by his father, who is &quot; Peter 
Larsen&quot; in his marriage certificate, but &quot; Peter Archibald Lawson&quot; in his 
son&apos;s birth certificate. The &quot;Archibald&quot; results from a misunderstanding 
on the part of the minister who officiated at the christening, and who, 
being rather deaf, mistook &quot; Hertzberg&quot; for &quot;Archibald,&quot; and sent the 
young Australian writer through the world with an English instead of a 
Norse middle-name— much to his father&apos;s disgust.) Peter Larsen was 
the son of a Norsk teacher of navigation, and a clever man with brain and 
hand. Henry Lawson&apos;s mother is well-known in Sydney as speaker 
and writer, and is proprietress of the woman&apos;s paper Dawn. At the time of 
Lawson&apos;s birth his father was a miner, but when he was a few months 
old his parents took a farm at Wilbertree, near Mudgee, N.S.W. His 
father gradually drifted into contracting, and in helping him and assisting 
on the farm Lawson made acquaintance with the bush life round his 
home. At 17 he came with his mother to Sydney, where he learnt 
the trade of coach-painter. His first published composition was &quot;The 
Song of the Republic,&quot; verses contributed to The Bulletin in 1887, and 
since then his pen has rarely been idle. In &apos;89 he went to Albany, 
W.A., following his trade. Returned to Sydney, and helped on a 
radical weekly, The Republican. In &apos;90-91 was on the staff of The 
Boomerang, Brisbane. In &apos;92 travelled from Bourke to the Queens- 
land border, &apos; swagging it&apos; as bush labourer for six months. In &apos;93 went 
to Maoriland; occupied as sawmill labourer and telegraph lineman. 
Returned to Sydney ; was for a month on staff of The Daily Worker, and

SOME PRESS OPINIONS. 

The Daily Telegraph, Sydney: 
It speaks highly for Australian taste that in so short a period since its 
first publication this book has reached an issue of eight thousand copies. 
Lucid, clear, manly, the deep emotion which inspires many of its pages is 
never maudlin or beyond the warrant of its occasion. ... A true poet in 
substance and form, of the kind easily understood by most, he deserves, and 
will achieve, still greater popularity. 

The Otago Witness, M.L. : 
He must be effete and weakly indeed whose languid senses do not quicken 
to the wave of love and the rhythm of galloping hoofs in Will Ogilvie&apos;s 
pages. ... A very good portrait of the author forms a welcome frontispiece.

The Queenslander : 

One of the best studies of selection life that Australia can ever hope to

bound to appreciate its pictures. In Queensland, especially, &quot;On Our

SOME PRESS OPINIONS. 

&quot;Realistic to a degree, and almost photographic in their accuracy. . . . 
They hold the reader by their dramatic power, and the feeling that they are 
pictures from life, and not merely the conjured-up dreams of a vivid imagina- 
tion. Mr. Dorrington . . . shows in them a gift for characterisation and 
dramatic expression, savoured with the essential salt of humour, that should, 
with a little restraint on his exuberance, carry him far.&quot; — Melbourne Age. 

&quot; He has been everywhere and seen everything, and he has to no ordinary 
extent the power of presenting things as they seemed to him— the gift of vivid 
and powerful narration. . . . Contains dramatic pictures which the best of our 
artists in words might well envy.&quot; — S.M. Herald.

The Press, Chnstchurch, says: In Mr. Arthur Adams . . . New Zealand 
at last finds poetic voice in the utterance of a native-born NewZealander. . . . 
There is no manner of doubt that Mr. Adams is a true poet. ... He has the 
power of melody, the gift of fine phrase, and the imaginative insight which 
are involved in that honoured and honourable name.
