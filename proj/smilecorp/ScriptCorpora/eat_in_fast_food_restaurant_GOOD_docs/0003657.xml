 can you melt small soap bars to make one big one?
 Here&apos;s the problem:

We always accumulate leftover soap bars (Zest) because DH says they are too small for his hand and slip. I want to melt all the small ones and make one big one. Is this possible and/or worth the trouble? TIA Reply With Quote 05-20-2004,  08:32 AM #2 KrisB

You can shave/grate the soap bars and put them in an oven safe pan. Add a little water, though it never specifies how much or how much soap to do at a time, use your judgement. Then place in the oven on a somewhat low setting, maybe around 250? I haven&apos;t done it this way. But I have shredded my soap and added a little water and done it on the stove top. It doesn&apos;t make a totally smooth ball/bar of soap, but it works. Reply With Quote 05-22-2004,  10:34 PM #5 debdog42

I&apos;ve done it for years! I never could get it to work with any other brand. Reply With Quote 05-24-2004,  01:57 PM #6 earthgrrl

I got mine at Target for a couple bucks, but if you want to see what they look like, see the link below (note, I found this site via google and have never bought anything here, so I can&apos;t vouch for them)
