Fast Food v Buffets v Restaurants with Home Cooking

Is it any coincidence that the rapid ascendancy of fast food outlets in the western world over the course of the last half-century or so has seen a drastic rise in the incidences of obesity, heart disease and certain types of cancers? I do not believe so. Burgers and &quot;hot dogs&quot; in particular are made with the cheapest cuts of meat, ground bone, and sometimes who knows what else, then fried in saturated fats. The salt content of fast foods also gives great cause for concern. Why are fast foods so unhealthy? The simple bottom line is that in order to clean up their acts and to effectively provide a more nutritional fare, the large fast food chains would at least in the shorter term have to accept a considerable reduction in their profit margin and we all know how appealing that would be to their chief executives, accountants and marketing managers!
 
Interim conclusion: fast food should be &quot;enjoyed&quot; only if you have absolutely no feasible alternative.

Buffets offer the diner a maximum choice without having to commit to pre-ordering one type of meal or another. There are still the dangers of high, undesirable levels of chemical content within the food and particularly sauces, but by sticking to freshly cooked cuts of meat, fish and poultry, as well as salads consisting of fresh produce and what at least appear to be freshly cooked vegetables, we do at least have some level of control over what we are consuming and can limit any associated risks accordingly.

Interim conclusion: a viable option in many circumstances.

Restaurants offering good, high quality home cooking often have a reputation to maintain as well as providing a varied, attractive and nourishing selection of items on their menus. Prime beef or steak pies, freshly prepared vegetables which all importantly happen to be in season at the time, locally caught fish or shellfish - the list of possibilities is almost endless. Personally, my own favourite type of restaurant in this bracket is the small, seaside country pub or hotel, where you know your meal is more likely to be prepared to order and the produce is likely to be as fresh as it is possible for it to be. It is also very likely that the owner and/or chef will have time to spend discussing with you the items on the menu and give you a greater insight in to what you are actually ordering.

Conclusion: option three for me every time!

I will close by simply stating that although I do enjoy a nice meal at a quality example of option three on occasion, there is nothing better for me than a home cooked meal actually prepared at home, lovingly and creatively, which you are in absolutely no doubt really does contain the freshest and most natural of ingredients.

Bon appetit!
