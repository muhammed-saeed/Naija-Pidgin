 Career Advice: Finding Yourself While Supersizing Fries 
 January 25th, 2011, myPathfinder Career Blog 
By Patrick O’Connor 

 

To his way of thinking, Bob had hit the very bottom of job opportunities.  Unemployed and without a college degree, he’d managed to find a number of entry-level sales jobs for about fifteen years, but all the doors he thought experience had opened suddenly closed, and there he was, turning in his application at a fast food restaurant, working with people half his age.

The first couple of days were pretty tough. There were procedures to memorize, bathrooms to inspect, and customers to serve.  This wasn’t at all what he was used to, and just when he thought he had time to catch his breath, his supervisor would gently come up to him and whisper the motto of all fast food employees–if there’s time to lean, there’s time to clean.

This saying changed his life completely. Towards the end of the first week, he was helping unload a refrigerator truck of inventory.  When he saw how his boss was storing the boxes, the question popped out of his mouth by accident–“Why are you doing it that way?”

His boss could have been insulted.  Instead, he simply said “What do you mean?”Using a technique he had learned in a previous job, Bob showed his boss a method of inventory storage where the boxes never had to be rotated in order to keep the stock fresh, a technique that saved hours and hours of precious employee time.  For the brief time Bob remained at that job, he never felt like he was at the bottom of the barrel again.

Career Advice: Every Job Can Teach You Something

You may find yourself in a position just like Bob’s, looking at a job you’d never dreamed you’d want to take or have to take, yet there it is–and there you are.  Like Bob, it would be easy to decide you’re at the end of your rope, all out of options, and decide that’s just the way it is.

But if all you do is settle for what you think is a job that chose you, and not the other way around, you’re missing the point of the story.  By giving a little more of himself to the job–learning the routines, caring about the customers, cleaning more than leaning–Bob opened himself up to the possibilities this “dead end”job had to offer.

Once he understood how the system worked, it was easier to see how he could improve it.  Of course, it helped that Bob had a boss that didn’t fire him when he second guessed his inventory technique–there’s a lesson there for all bosses to follow–but the key to Bob’s success on this job was understanding what was needed and meeting that need, not changing the need, or relentlessly wishing he was somewhere else.

It’s hard to say if that change of attitude is what helped Bob find a different job so quickly, but it’s safe to say Bob’s different viewpoint made him a happier person and a more productive employee–and who wouldn’t want those qualities in their lives, on their resume, or as part of their references?

New statistics tell us the job market is brightening, but there are so many other factors to consider–the price of gas, the mood of employers–no one can say sunnier economic days are a sure thing. Still, any good chef will tell you that the biggest part of a successful meal isn’t the ingredients you have, but how you combine them to make the best possible presentation, and that’s true in any kitchen in life…

…even one in a fast food restaurant.

 As a counselor and college adviser for 25 years, Patrick O’Connor has helped unemployed workers, veterans, returning students, and new high school graduates learn new skills, earn degrees, prepare for graduate school and get better-paying jobs.  He’s a past president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and author of the widely acclaimed college guide, College is Yours in 600 Words or Less . Most important, he’d like to help you realize your goals for college and career success.
