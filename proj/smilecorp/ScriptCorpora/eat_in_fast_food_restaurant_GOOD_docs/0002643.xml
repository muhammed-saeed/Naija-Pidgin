		Obesity supplement pills and advice on diet and 
food selection, natural treatment by Ray Sahelian, M.D. 
 Overall, about 27 percent of men and women in the United States are obese. 
The risk is 
higher as we age, and higher if we are under stress. The 
prevalence is about the same among black and white men, but much 
higher among black and Hispanic women than among white women. Obesity stats show about 
60 percent of middle-aged black women are obese compared with 33 percent of 
white women. This is a 
health problem associated with higher rates of chronic
medical conditions and worse physical health than a lifetime of smoking, poverty or
problem drinking, making it the top health risk. Obesity can lead to high blood pressure and increase the risk for migraine headache, cancer, heart disease, diabetes , chronic 
fatigue, and gout .
  Is there a way to reduce the risks? See weight loss for natural options such as food selection and dietary choices to deal 
with obesity including various types of diet such as low 
carbohydrate , high protein, high fat, etc. See diet for healthy suggestions, 
including how to increase fiber food 
intake. 
 
 Natural supplements for obesity control 
These herbs and nutrients for obesity may work in some people while 
others may find no benefit.

Apple cider vinegar
 Banaba leaf is used in Southeast Asia to lower blood sugar and promote healthy 
insulin levels that are related to appetite.
Bitter Orange is the same as citrus aurantium and often found in anti obesity 
pill products in health food stores.
Cayenne pepper is a thermogenic herb 
Cha de bugre is an herb used in South America.
Caralluma Fimbriata extract is being promoted as a weight loss herb, or 
specifically as a cactus or succulent.
 Hoodia is a cactus plant extract from the Kalahari 
desert in South Africa that has been getting a lot of attention lately.
 Ephedra may be back on the 
market, but I do not recommend its use at this time.
 Chitosan has not been 
found to be helpful in reducing obesity. You can find supplements here. Chitosan 
supplements may have a purpose in other health issues and medical conditions but 
it does not appear that 
 5-HTP is a nutrient that helps curb appetite in 
some individuals.
 Acetyl-l-carnitine can sometimes help reduce appetite and it is also a 
potent brain enhancer.
 Lipoic acid is not very 
effective by itself. 

 How you carry your fat 
influences health and mortality
It is not just overall obesity but also how body fat is distributed that 
determines a person&apos;s risk of dying over a given period. Both waist 
circumference and the waist-to-hip ratio are independent predictors of 
mortality. 

 Fast Food and Obesity
There is no doubt that high calorie foods, such as fast foods, 
increase adipose tissue size, cause obesity and often severe obesity. These fast foods include sandwiches with white bread, 
sweets, sodas with sugar, ice cream, and others. A fast-food restaurant 
within about 500 feet of a school leads to at least a 5 percent increase 
in the obesity rate at that school. 

 Candy, soda and other junk foods commonly sold at 
stores not traditionally associated with food may be contributing to the 
U.S. obesity problem. A study, of more than 1,000 non-food retail stores 
across the U.S., found that 41 percent sold candy, soft drinks, chips 
and other sweet and salty snacks. The foods were most commonly placed at 
check-out counters, where they were&quot;within arm&apos;s reach&quot;of impulsive 
buyers. This easy availability of snack foods may tempt many people into 
buying calories that they otherwise would not. And over time, those 
calories could add up to extra pounds. American Journal of Public 
Health, online December 17, 2009. 

 Causes of obesity - beyond genetic 
Obesity results from consuming more calories than the body uses. Genetic and
environmental factors influence body weight, but precisely how they interact to determine
a person&apos;s weight is still unclear. One proposed explanation is that body weight is
regulated around a set point, similar to a thermostat setting. A higher-than-normal set
point may explain why some people are obese and why losing weight and maintaining weight
loss are difficult for them. 
     Reduced physical activity is probably one of
the main reasons for the increase in obesity among people in affluent societies. 
Designing walkable communities is a cost-effective way to address the growing 
epidemic of obesity in the United States and cut down on harmful car emissions 
and pollution. 
    Easy access to calorie-dense foods and drinks, along with a sedentary lifestyle in
front of the TV tube are major factors. Rarely, hormonal disorders cause obesity. 
Depression and obesity are sometimes related. Depression could lead to excess 
caloric consumption, while obesity, with its resultant lack of physical activity 
and poor body image could lead to low mood or depression.
   Waiting longer to start infants on solid food could lead to slimmer 
adults. 

 Is obesity socially contagious?
It appears to be socially contagious as it can spread among individuals in 
close social circles. The likely explanations: A person&apos;s idea of what is an 
appropriate body size is affected by the size of his or her friends. The types 
of foods eaten or restaurants visited could be similar, and activity level could 
become similar. For instance, if you hand out with obese friends who enjoys 
movies, along with popcorn and sodas, you are more likely to add on extra pounds 
than if you have friends whose idea of fun is to take long walks or bike rides. 

 Obesity may be contagious because most people feel 
good about themselves if they are about as heavy as the people around them. This 
could explain the rapid rise in the prevalence of overweight around the world. 
The norm that most people compare themselves to has become fatter and fatter, 
feeding a cycle of&quot;imitative obesity.&quot; 

 Sodas and bbesity
Soda and other sugar-sweetened drinks don&apos;t just go hand-in-hand, but actually cause it. Not that these drinks are the only cause -- 
genetics, exercise and other factors are involved -- but sodas are an important 
cause, perhaps the leading cause. 

 Income
 Socioeconomic factors strongly influence obesity, especially among women. In the United States, obesity is more
than twice as common among women in lower socioeconomic groups as among women in higher
ones. Why socioeconomic factors have such a strong influence on women&apos;s weight is not
fully understood, but sanctions against obesity do increase with increasing social status.
Women in higher socioeconomic groups have more time and resources for the dieting and
exercise that enable them to conform to these social demands. 

 2011 - West Virginia 
outweighs Mississippi as the most obese state. The poll finds that 33.5% of West 
Virginians -- one in three state residents -- are obese. Colorado was the least 
obese state. One in five Colorado residents is obese. Overall, the Gallup poll 
finds that 26.6% of American adults were obese in 2010. That&apos;s about the same as 
the 26.5% found to be obese in 2009. 

 2006 - Louisiana, Mississippi and West 
Virginia have the highest percentage of obese residents, while Colorado, 
Connecticut, Hawaii and Vermont have the lowest. The survey of 300,000 adults by 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that overall, 60.5 
percent of Americans were overweight, 23.9 percent were obese, and 3 percent 
were extremely obese. Obesity was as common in men as in women -- 24 percent in 
both. Among ethnic groups, non-Hispanic blacks had the highest rates, with just 
under 34 percent of those surveyed considered obese.
The overall obesity rate of 23.9 percent is up from 15.6 percent in 1995 and 
19.8 percent in 2000. Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia are among the six 
poorest U.S. states, based on welfare need. 

 2007 - Mississippi ranks No. 1 with 30 
percent of the population overweight. Obesity rates continued their climb in 31 
states last year. No state showed a decline. Mississippi became the first state 
to crack the 30 percent barrier for adult residents considered to be obese. West 
Virginia and Alabama are just slightly behind. Colorado continued its reign as 
the leanest state in the nation with an obesity rate projected at 17 percent. 
Utah has the lowest percentage of obese youth at 8 percent. 

 Emotions and obesity
 Emotional disturbances, once considered
an important cause, are now considered a reaction to the strong prejudice and
discrimination against obese people. One type of emotional disturbance, a negative body
image, is a serious problem for many young obese women. It leads to extreme
self-consciousness and discomfort in social situations. 

 Diabetes
There is little doubt that obesity increases the risk for diabetes. 
Obesity leads to insulin resistance. Sugar in the blood is not able to leave the 
blood stream and enter tissues, thus leading to high blood sugar.
  Obesity is the most important modifiable risk factor 
for type 2 diabetes mellitus and most patients with diabetes are overweight or 
obese. It is well known that excess bodyweight induces or aggravates insulin 
resistance, which is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes. Thus, 
bodyweight plays a central role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. 
Recent data suggest that lifestyle intervention in patients with impaired 
glucose tolerance results in an impressive reduction in the conversion to overt 
diabetes, which is greater than the effect of early intervention with drugs such 
as metformin or acarbose. The prevention of diabetes has been shown to be 
associated with the extent of weight loss. In patients with type 2 diabetes, 
weight loss by any means is followed by an improvement of metabolic control and 
associated risk factors. The most appropriate recommendation for obese patients 
with type 2 diabetes is a nutritionally balanced, moderately hypocaloric diet 
with a reduced intake of saturated fat and an increase in physical activity. If 
this standard approach is only partly successful or not at all, additional 
strategies such as weight-lowering drugs, very low-calorie diets for limited 
periods of up to 12 weeks, and, for severely obese patients, bariatric surgery 
should be carefully considered. A large body of data suggests that such measures 
can be very effective in this patient group by improving metabolic disturbances 
and blood pressure. However, it is extremely important for the long-term outcome 
that the treatment is tailored to the needs and wishes of the individual 
patient. 

 Obesity and Heart Disease
Even in the absence of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk 
factors, obesity in midlife is associated with an elevated risk of 
hospitalization and death from coronary heart disease (CHD) 
in older age. 

 Amyloid, obesity, and Alzheimer&apos;s disease
As body fat increases, so do blood levels of a protein fragment linked to 
Alzheimer&apos;s disease, which may explain the reported association between obesity and the 
brain-wasting disease. Obesity by itself, even in otherwise healthy middle-aged 
people, is associated with elevated levels of the amyloid peptide that builds up 
and causes Alzheimer&apos;s. High levels of amyloid in the brain lead to amyloidosis . 

 Brain degeneration
Obese people have 8 percent less brain tissue than normal-weight individuals. 
Their brains look 16 years older than the brains of lean individuals. Those 
classified as overweight have 4 percent less brain tissue and their brains 
appear to have aged prematurely by 8 years. 

 Eye disease
Obesity is a key factor in sight loss. Obesity raises the risk of developing 
three major types of sight loss: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a 
condition affecting the retina; diabetic retinopathy, a progressive blurring of 
vision developed by 60 percent of type 2 diabetes sufferers; cataracts, a 
clouding of the eye lens responsible for one in four cases of sight loss in 
people over 75. 

 Obesity, pregnancy and 
fertility
Obesity decreases the chances that a woman will become pregnant, and the more 
obese she is, the worse her prospects of conception.
  Women who are obese before they become pregnant are at increased 
risk of having a baby with defects of the brain and spinal cord, especially if 
they tend to put on weight around the waist. The more obese a woman is when she becomes pregnant, 
the greater the likelihood that her baby will be born with a heart defect. 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online April 7, 2010. 

 Plantar fasciitis
The risk for plantar 
fasciitis increases as a person becomes heavier. 

 Obesity and prostate cancer 
or enlargement
Obese men have an increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence and death after 
they have completed radiation therapy. A very high body mass index (BMI) can be a 
confounding factor when evaluating a man&apos;s results from the prostate specific 
antigen PSA test. 

Anti Obesity medications
Pharmacological therapy for obesity is in transition. Historically, there 
have been few effective agents, and many have been with-drawn because of 
unacceptable side effects. Current options include three medications approved by 
the FDA for the treatment of obesity: phentermine, sibutramine and orlistat. 
Phentermine and sibutramine suppress appetite and promote thermogenesis,and 
orlistat blocks fat digestion and absorption in the gut. Several drugs approved 
for other indications often promote weight loss, including bupropion, metformin, 
topiramate and zonisamide; they have been used empirically for treatment of 
obesity and to counter the weight-promoting effects of other medications. 

 Drugs that Cause Obesity
 A number of commonly used drugs cause weight gain. 
They include corticosteroids such as prednisone and many antidepressants, as 
well as many drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders.

 BMI
Obesity is calculated using the body mass index (BMI) -- dividing weight 
in kilograms by height in meters squared. A BMI of more than 30 is considered 
obese, more than 40 is very severe. 

 Obesity in America - 
Environmental Factors
Americans are getting taller on average but they are much heavier 
too. On average, adult men and women are about an inch taller than 
they were in 1960 and 25 pounds heavier. The average body mass index 
(BMI), a weight-for-height formula used to measure obesity, has tipped 
across the overweight point from 25 in 1960 to 28 in 2002. The 
government&apos;s latest report on height and weight shows that the average 
height of a man aged 20 to 74 went from just over 5 feet 8 inches in 1960 
to 5 feet 9 inches in 2002. The average height of a woman has gone from 5 
feet 3 inches to 5 feet 4 inches. Weights, however, have ballooned. The 
average weight of an adult man was 166.3 pounds in 1960 and 191 pounds in 
2002, while the average weight for women went from 140.2 pounds to 164.3 
pounds.
  Obesity must be recognized and treated as a disease 
with deadly complications. Up to 8 percent of total healthcare costs in 
some Western countries are attributable to obesity and related problems. 
It is a leading cause of preventable death -- so shedding excess weight is 
not just about looking good. Obesity is not an aesthetic problem. It is a 
very complex problem tightly connected to diabetes, atherosclerosis 
(blocked arteries) and other major health problems and causes of death.
  Obesity is an end result of the intricate interactions 
of biology, behavior, and environment. Recent hypotheses in the scientific 
community suggest the current obesity epidemic in the USA is being driven 
largely by environmental factors (e.g., high energy/high fat foods, fast 
food consumption, television watching,&quot;super-sized&quot;portions, etc.) 
rather than biological ones. Individuals are bombarded with images and 
offers of high fat, high calorie, highly palatable, convenient, and 
inexpensive foods. These foods are packaged in portion sizes that far 
exceed federal recommendations. Furthermore, the physical demands of our 
society have changed resulting in an imbalance in energy intake and 
expenditure. Today&apos;s stressful lifestyles compound the effects of 
environmental factors by impairing weight loss efforts and by promoting 
fat storage. Combating the obesity epidemic demands environmental and 
social policy changes, particularly in the areas of portion size, 
availability of healthful foods, and promotion of physical activity. 

 United States
The rate of obesity is highest in the Southeast and Appalachia. High rates of 
obesity and diabetes are reported in more than 80 percent of counties in the 
Appalachian region that includes Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. The same 
problem was seen in about 75 percent of counties in Alabama, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina. The five counties with the highest rates 
are Greene and Dallas counties in Alabama and Holmes, Humphreys and Jefferson 
counties in Mississippi. All are small, rural counties in the west central areas 
of each state, and each report obesity rates of around 44 or 43 percent. The 
national adult obesity rate is roughly 26 percent. 

 Obesity in child - Childhood 
More than half a million children in Europe may be suffering from a 
cluster of obesity -related risk factors that will increase their odds of 
developing diabetes, heart disease and stroke. New research presented at 
the 14th European Congress on Obesity in May 2005 shows that youngsters in 
Europe are catching up with their obese counterparts in the United States, 
where 2 million children are affected by metabolic 
syndrome . Its symptoms include a large waistline, high blood pressure, 
raised insulin levels, excess body weight and abnormal cholesterol levels. 
If someone has three or more symptoms they have the syndrome and a higher 
risk of suffering from life-threatening illnesses.
  The more soda kids drink, the more likely they are to 
be obese. However, soft drinks are not the only cause of the ongoing 
childhood obesity crisis, which is also fueled by a lack of physical 
activity, and too much TV, high fat and simple 
carbohydrate foods, among other problems.
   Obese people, particularly those who
became obese during childhood, may have up to five times more fat cells than people of
normal weight. Because the number of cells can&apos;t be reduced, weight can be lost only by
reducing the amount of fat in each cell.
  Obese children who lose weight through diet and exercise become 
stronger and more agile in the process. A program that focuses on physical 
activity and diet education is able to not just help obese children shed 
pounds, but to also improve their endurance, strength, balance and 
coordination.
  Replacing sugar-laden drinks with water has a dramatic impact on 
the amount of calories kids consume and helps the fight against 
childhood obesity.
  Overweight and obese children have more aches and pains in their 
muscles and bones than their normal-weight peers. Annals of Family 
Medicine, 2009.
   Obese children who watch a lot of television are more likely to have high 
blood pressure than heavy children who don&apos;t spend as much time in front 
of the tube. 

 Screening
In an update to their 2005 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force 
recommends that clinicians screen children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years 
old for obesity. For patients who are obese based on body mass index (BMI) 
percentile for age and gender, the Task Force advises referral to a 
comprehensive program that includes dietary, physical activity, and behavioral 
counseling components to promote weight loss. Skyrocketing rates of obesity have 
reached approximately 12% to 18% in 2- to 19-year-olds, increasing up to 6-fold 
since the 1970s. In addition to dietary and physical activity counseling, 
effective programs included behavioral management techniques such as 
self-monitoring, stimulus control, eating management, contingency management, 
and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Pediatrics 2010.
 
Obesity and risk of diabetes and heart disease in 
children
American children and teens are growing ever-fatter tummies, a bad sign 
that means they are at even more risk of heart disease and diabetes, U.S. 
researchers reported in November, 2006. They found that the belly fat of 
children and teenagers had increased by more than 65 percent since the 
1990s -- directly in line with rising obesity rates. Belly fat is more 
dangerous than general weight gain, because abdominal and visceral fat -- 
found surrounding the internal organs -- is more clearly and strongly 
linked with disease than general body fat. 

 Premature puberty and 
obesity
Childhood obesity in the United States appears to be causing girls 
to reach puberty at an earlier age, for reasons that are not clear but 
could be related to excess estrogen production by fatty tissue. 

 Obesity Management
During the last two decades, the prevalence of adults in the higher 
body mass index (BMI) categories in the US has increased the most, as much 
as 300% for those with a BMI above 40kg/m2. In children and adolescents, a 
doubling of the prevalence of severe obesity poses a serious health 
risk to future generations of young adults who may develop chronic 
diseases normally associated with aging. The simple definition of obesity, 
an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, ignores the 
complexity of, and largely unknown interactions between, genes, food 
intake and physical activity, which together determine bodyweight and fat 
distribution. Although the etiology and manifestations of overweight and 
obesity are complex, the assessment of overweight and obesity requires 
only an accurate measurement of bodyweight, height and abdominal 
circumference, as well as a history and physical examination attuned to 
the morbidities that commonly accompany overweight and obesity such as 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and sleep apnea. The 
treatment of patients with overweight and obesity continues to be based on 
changes to diet and physical activity. Simple behavior modification 
techniques are within the reach of busy clinicians. The additional use of 
available bodyweight reduction medications can reliably lead to a 5 to 10% 
reduction from initial bodyweight, a loss that has been shown to provide 
significant health benefit. The use of meal replacements has also been 
shown to be effective and is probably an under-appreciated treatment 
resource. Surgery is the most successful treatment for those with severe 
obesity and should be discussed as an option for those in the appropriate 
bodyweight categories. 

 Growth Hormone and Obesity
The bulk of studies indicate little or no beneficial effects of HGH treatment of obesity 
despite the low serum HGH concentrations associated with obesity. 

 Obesity Surgery as a last 
resort
Surgery for obesity is called bariatric surgery. There is no 
one operation that is effective for all patients. Gastric bypass 
operations are the most common operations currently used. Because there 
are complications from surgeries, bariatric surgery should be performed in 
a multidisciplinary setting. The laparoscopic approach is being used by 
some surgeons in performing the various operations. The success 
rate--usually defined as&gt;50% excess weight loss that is maintained for at 
least five years from bariatric surgery--ranges from 30% in the simple to 
70% in the complex operations. The weight loss from surgical treatment 
results in significant improvements and, in some cases, resolution of 
comorbid conditions associated with obesity. Patients undergoing surgery 
for obesity need lifelong nutritional supplements and medical monitoring. 
However, obesity surgery complication are common.
    Obesity surgery has high complication rates. An HHS 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) study has found that 
about 40% of 2,522 patients who had obesity surgery at 308 hospitals 
developed a significant complication during the six months after they left 
the hospital. The five most common complications were dumping syndrome, 
which includes vomiting, reflux, and diarrhea (nearly 20%); leaks or 
strictures resulting from the joining of the intestine and stomach (12%); 
abdominal hernias (7%); infections (6%); and pneumonia (4%). 

 Obesity Research 
The hypothalamus and obesity.
Curr Drug Targets. 2005.
Obesity, a condition already at epidemic proportions in the developed 
world, is largely attributable to an indulgent lifestyle. Biologically we 
feel hunger more acutely than feeling&quot;full-up&quot;(satiety). The discovery 
over a decade ago of leptin, an adiposity signal, revolutionised our 
understanding of hypothalamic mechanisms underpinning the central control 
of ingestive behaviour. The structure and function of many hypothalamic 
peptides (Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Melanocortins, Agouti related peptide (AGRP), 
Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART), Melanin concentrating 
hormone (MCH), Orexins and endocannabinoids) have been characterised in 
rodent models. The pharmacological potential of several endogenous 
peripheral peptides released prior to, during and/or after feeding are 
being explored. Short-term signal hormones including Cholecystokinin (CCK), 
Ghrelin, Peptide YY (PYY(3-36)) and Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) 
control meal size via pathways converging on the hypothalamus. Long-term 
regulation is provided by the main circulating hormones leptin and 
insulin. These systems among others, implicated in hypothalamic appetite 
regulation all provide potential&quot;drugable&quot;targets by which to treat 
obesity. 

 In the United States, roughly 10 percent of all 
cancers -- more than 100,000 cases a year -- could be avoided if 
overweight and obesity did not exist. The new projections stem from a 
review of published studies, updates to the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) report from 2002, and data from the Nurses&apos; 
Health Study II, which includes 116,686 women, Dr. Graham Colditz 
explained at a press briefing at the American Association for Cancer 
Research&apos;s international conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention 
Research underway in Baltimore. 

 The tongue may indeed have a taste for 
cheesecake, french fries and butter cookies. In experiments with rodents, 
French scientists identified a receptor on the tongue that appears to 
detect dietary fat. This counters the traditional view that the taste buds 
pick up only five basic flavors: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and&quot;umami,&quot;-- a flavor associated with the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG). 
The fact that the tongue harbors receptors for fatty acids could shed new 
light on appetite control and obesity. 

 Questions 
Q. Does the herb pinellia ternata help with weight loss?
  A. I am aware of one rodent study that showed it to have possible 
anti obesity effect.
