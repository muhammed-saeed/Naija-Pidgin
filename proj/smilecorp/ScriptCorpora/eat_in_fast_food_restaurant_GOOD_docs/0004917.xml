 Teens shot &apos;execution style&apos; in Cady Way Trail double-slaying 
 
By Bianca Prieto , Orlando Sentinel
 , June 26, 2012 Bound and blind-folded, Nicholas Presha and Jeremy Stewart were shot one at a time near the bank of a canal along the Cady Way Trail. The teens were shot &quot;execution style&quot; and Stewart died instantly of a single gunshot to the head. Nicholas was shot three times — the first bullet in the back of his head didn&apos;t end his life, so the shooter fired two more rounds into his face. Then their bodies were lit on fire. About 200 pages of evidence in the April 15 shooting and burning deaths of the Winter Park High School students was released Tuesday, depicting the teens&apos; horrifying last hours.
