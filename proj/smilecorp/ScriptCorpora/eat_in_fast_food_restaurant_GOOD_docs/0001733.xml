Must see Mina....

My husband and I have purchased over 12 cars over a seven year period.  This was hands down the best experience!  If you want to get straight to point and not play the games.. go see Mina.

Hands down the worst experience at any car dealer.  When you are about to drop over $100,000 on a car you would expect some sort of professionalism.  Don&apos;t expect it here.  Look only for deceptive sales tactics and that good ole used car salesmanship.

Just before writing the down payment check, I decided I had enough.  It must have been the fact that they kept speaking Farsi behind my back.

I went to BH Porsche and bought the car there instead.

I ended up financing through Porsche and the rate they gave me in BH was 1.9. Pacific wanted to charge me 2.9. What a rip off.

I don&apos;t usually write reviews, but today I&apos;m writing about my excellent experience with Pacific Porsche. Many Porsche owners out there are quite well-off financially; I am NOT one of these people. I am the other side of Porsche owners who saved for quite a long time in order to purchase my Carrera-S. This means that when my car has to be serviced, it becomes a tense moment when trying to figure how much I&apos;m going to spend t in order to fix my beloved machine. I arrived at Pacific Porsche because it is close to the new neighborhood which I&apos;ve just moved into.

Here&apos;s the back story: My airbag warning light came on. I initially took it to an indie mechanic who was also quite good but was unable to fix it because he did not have the electronic equipment proprietary to Porsche, so he suggested that I go to the dealership.

I actually bought my Carrera-S at another dealership and purchased the extended insurance from another separate company. At this point, I wasn&apos;t sure if they&apos;d take the time to make the phone calls to sort through all the warranty company&apos;s red-tape so my repairs would be covered.

Luckily for me, Jim in the service department took care of everything! I didn&apos;t have to make any phone calls on my own to sort out the paperwork from the 3rd party warranty company. It was all covered-- excellent service!

Now, August (that&apos;s his name), the technician who worked on my car was equally as awesome. He took the time to search through my car and see if there was any work-arounds to the problem in order to help save me some money... he quickly assessed that my issue was a front airbag sensor that had gone bad. When he tried to access the front airbag sensor through the front trunk, he also realized that the latch was very temperamental in opening. I already knew this latch annoyance but forgot to tell him.

It took all day to find the pesky electronic issue. It was now 5 pm on a Friday (closing time). I was given the choice to either have them keep the car over the weekend or put all the parts back together and have me bring it back the following week. Understand that it is now 5pm and ALL the technicians had gone home. My car and August was the ONLY one left in the shop! He kept working on my car and even took the time to explain the issue! Then... he said this, &quot;If you want to take the car home, I  CAN STAY LATE and put it back together for you...&quot; This kind of courtesy and excellent service is totally unheard off at any dealership of any kind!! This dude was super cool and his gesture was greatly appreciated.

I decided to have them keep the car through the weekend, Jim said that he&apos;d like to give me a loaner car but they were all out--then he offered to have the dealer pay for my rental car as a courtesy!

From my personal experience, the service guys here (Jim and August) provided me with the best service experience I&apos;ve had at a dealership. Ask for them if you need your Porsche serviced.

5 stars--well deserved!

My original post for this dealer was 4 star, after 5 months picked up the car, I would down grade my rating to 1 stars. The sales that sold me the car promised he would provided 3 complimentary Porsche gifts, the lowest price 2 gifts were delivered (mugs... key chain....), but the last one was never available...5 months email going back and forth and left many voice mails... when I am lucky, I will get the replied &quot;let me check for you&quot;....and then it was dead...... Not a great way to get repeating business.

After months of on and off web browsing used Cayennes, the wifey finally breaks me down to go &quot;look&quot; at some in person.  We saw some at McKenna and some at Pacific, which is actually the closer location.  The one we wanted was at McKenna in Norwalk so we went there first.  And frankly, I thought it would be the less uptight experience being further away from the South Bay.  I didn&apos;t know what to expect from a Porsche dealership.  Up until then, the entire brand had really been out of our price and comfort zone (we&apos;re an entry-level Lexus and BMW family).  I envisioned dress codes, snooty looks and a general, but clear, feeling of class distinction.  Have to admit that was pretty much the experience we received.  So we walked away somewhat disappointed (hadn&apos;t realized how much I wanted even a used model) but not surprised.  Never felt so bummed/ashamed to get into a Lexus.  :(

It wasn&apos;t until we stopped by Pacific Porsche on the way back (just to see - I can&apos;t believe I was signing up for more rejection!) that we realized the treatment we got a McKenna had nothing at all to with the fact they dealt Porsches.  The experience was night and day.

Richard Presley walked up to us immediately and in a very disarming manner. He took our interest very seriously (somewhat surprising as we&apos;re in our early 30&apos;s but look early 20&apos;s) and was very frank about numbers.  Where the price points are, trade in values and profit margins.  More importantly he was very open about where he could hack away at the price and where he couldn&apos;t.  As a numbers guy, it was very refreshing to feel like a traditionally shady transaction suddenly felt very open and transparent.  Long story short, my wife and I walked out a couple of hours later short one RX 330 but plus one Cayenne S.

Really can&apos;t say enough about Richard&apos;s continued interest in our experience.  Even after the sell, he continues to keep in touch and go above and beyond to make us feel comfortable in the brand.  That really goes for the entire staff we interacted with, from the site manager (Mike? - nice shirt by the way!) to Christine in finance.  All really made us feel welcome.

Have to say, that even though I know what they&apos;re doing, we can&apos;t help but let it work.  We&apos;ll totally be back to Pacific for our next car, er, Panamera.

Until next time Richard...

I used Pacific Porsche after the recommendation from my mom and from a close friend. Both were very impressed with the customer service and drove out of the way (from West LA) just to do business with them. I was at Pacific Porsche today and now I see why.

Everyone there is incredibly friendly and goes out of there way to be helpful, accommodating and even more importantly-they stick to their word! Once they get you in the door, they do not try to cut corners, but stick to what you were promised.

This was such a relief as I have dealt with other dealerships that are pushy, rude and manipulative. Not here. I will be back!

I came here for service again. I had a particular part covered under warranty but I still had to pay a substantial sum. I hate those ambiguous warranties, that leave you fully covered or partially covered.

They&apos;re a great dealer to buy cars from, their test driving program is very pleasant but their service department sucks. I hate bringing my car here but in this case I had no other choice.

I&apos;ve heard horror stories of people stopping by Porsche and being treated like they had the bubonic plague or at a minimum a serious case of pink eye.

I&apos;ve been told that upon entering the sales advisor jumps you from behind and removes your wallet and accompanying drivers license in the time it takes for you to say &quot;I don&apos;t want any.&quot; All  to run your credit report in an effort to &quot;prequalify&quot; before you even lay eyes on the showroom let alone sit behind the wheel.

I&apos;ve read that one can only look but not touch.

I found no such wive&apos;s tales to be true. The guys at this dealership were friendly and quick to let me get behind the wheel of a Cayenne S. Without the blink of an eye Richard instructed me to punch it and see what the &quot;S&quot; was all about.

I was impressed with their hands off approach and their ability to treat me not only like I didn&apos;t carry an airborne illness but also like an educated woman who knew how to drive a car. I didn&apos;t scare Richard when we went over 50mph on a city street. Ahem, Mark at BMW I cannot say the same about you... and I love BMW.

The 2011 Cayenne S rocked. I&apos;m going to wait a year or two so I don&apos;t get slapped with the off the lot depreciation which practically triples for Euro cars. My time at Porsche gave me something to look forward to.  Cayenne you will be mine. You will be mine.

Thank you Pacific Porsche.

Purchased my car at downtown LA dealership but bring it here for service.  Will definitely buy here next time as everyone is great to deal with.

Service Pros;
Easy to make appointments
Staff is very accommodating
Loaners have never been a problem
Follow up issues are handled promptly
Never pushed for any &quot;additional&quot; work
Straight forward about tire, brake, clutch, etc. life

My friends take theirs to private mechanics but I have never had an issue with Pacific Porsche service and would recommend them.

I had to come in today because my check engine light came on just after a tune-up (2-weeks ago).  They immediately sent it to the shop (no wait) and diagnosed the problem.

Answer:  could be the cat conv but they can&apos;t confirm as the computer corrected itself.  Recommend not replacing unless the sensor goes on again within 200 miles.  Whole process took 30-min including the car wash.

&quot;Check engine oil level&quot; light came on so I stopped at Pacific Porsche to top off my oil.  I thought they were going to give me the cold shoulders because I bought the car elsewhere.

Nope.  Peter &quot;the mechanic&quot; came out and topped it off free of charge and with a smile.

I will come back for my scheduled maintenance.

Hm I have never had a problem when I get service here.  I make appointments online, drop-off is quick and easy, they always have a loaner, they always check for recalls, they call me throughout the day if there are issues, and the car is always ready on time.  They also wash it.  It&apos;s expensive to maintain a Porsche but they send out coupons in the mail for 10 or 15 percent off and it&apos;s never a problem redeeming the coupons.  It&apos;s just so convenient, I always use them.

I bought my cars elsewhere (Beverly Hills and Walters) because they were not willing to meet my terms. However, because it is the closest to where I live, I take my cars here for service.

Caveat...whenever they have Customer Appreciation Day (relatively cheap oil change) or I find a 20% off service coupon, I take my car in. They always have a loaner car available.

All of my experiences here have been pretty satisfactory. On one occasion, when I picked up my car, I even found a brand new set of car cleaning stuff (soap, wax, chammie, etc) in the passenger seat.

I do agree with other reviewers that they are kind of spotty in returning phone calls and confirming service, but whatevers. It&apos;s not that big of a deal.

I walked into this dealer browsing around for a new car and Dan (my salesperson) couldn&apos;t have been nicer nor more accommodating. He really went out of his way to be friendly and helpful even though I walked in looking like a complete bum (I&apos;m serious... I was wearing cut-off jean shorts, a tank-top&amp;flip flops which doesn&apos;t exactly scream &quot;legitimate buyer&quot; when looking at $100k-200k cars). Lol. He actually took the time and really &quot;listened&quot; to what I was saying and did his best to make sure I was happy. No hard sale here. Most dealers I have been to in the past simply give me the &quot;once over&quot; and dismiss me as an actual buyer but that definitely wasn&apos;t the case here. I must say even the girl in finance was super friendly, helpful and made sure I was aware of all my available options (and got me a great interest rate too!). I&apos;m now the proud of owner of 2 cool Porsches (I know, I&apos;m a total douche owning 2 but I don&apos;t care) and I couldn&apos;t be happier. If you want a cool, laid-back, friendly sales-guy... ask for Dan. You&apos;ll be happy you did and he&apos;ll totally do what he can to make sure you walk away happy. When I told him I wanted rims from a different model&amp;different options which I wanted removed from a different car he didn&apos;t treat me like the pain in the ass, chick-buyer that I am. He actually got me what I wanted and with a smile!! So when I finally finish saving up for that Porsche Turbo S that costs more than my 1st house, I&apos;ll be sure to go back to Pacific Porsche and ask for Dan. At least I know I&apos;ll be taken seriously :)

Avoid this &quot;stealership&quot; at all costs. You would think that a store selling $100,000 and up products would be able to give better customer service than a fast food restaurant. Think again!

They have repeatedly failed to repair and often made worse simple issues with my cars. One time on a road trip, major check engine lights came on and I went to another dealership.  Upon examining the car they documented 2 major mechanical issues that Pacific  Porsche&apos;s service team had caused.

The staff is rude and frequently won&apos;t give the courtesy to respond to emails or calls without legal threats.

Read the customer reviews. Never go here if you can help it. I am pretty sure the only highly ranked review was the management.

I was warned by several people not to go to Pacific Porsche especially if you are a woman. I am a 44 years old professional woman with two children. I walked in to test drive and was ready to buy a car. Sales person made very inappropriate and unprofessional comment. I told him it was an insulting and inappropriate comment. He just brushed it off. I went to buy my car at BH Porsche instead. While I was buying my car, another customer came in and was asking for a BH Porsche license plate. He said it&apos;s because he is so unhappy with Pacific Porsche that he refuses to have Pacific Porsche plate.
When I had problems with my tire, I had to take my car in for service at Pacific Porsche which is the closest dealer from where I live. The sales people standing outside were harassing me... yelling at me for bringing in a BH dealer car. On top of that, another sales person came and they were giving me the dirtiest look pointing fingers at me. I did complain about this on the survey. I have to take my car in for another service again a week after that. The same sales person was there again giving me the stare of hatred.
BE WARNED DO NOT BUY YOUR CAR HERE. GIVE BUSINESS TO NICE PEOPLE.... LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

Bought a used Audi yesterday at this dealer. Could not have been a better buying experience. Price was good. Negotiating was easy. They found a better loan rate than my credit union. They even filled up the tank!!! The only reason this is not 5 stars is it took a LOOOOOOng time.

**If you are trading in a car, they go over it with a fine toothed comb, more than any dealer ever has (They even put it up on the rack!!)

Kam (Salesman) and Mark (Manager) were a pleasure to deal with. This may be where I buy all my cars from now on.
