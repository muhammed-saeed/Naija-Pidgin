 You! Add Photos&amp;Videos More bad news for McDonald&apos;s . Subway -- home of the sandwiches that somehow make guys named Jared lose weight, not to mention one of the most annoying ad campaigns in recent history (you know the tune) -- has surpassed Mickey D&apos;s as the world&apos;s largest restaurant chain, The Wall Street Journal reports.

At the end of last year, Subway had 33,749 restaurants worldwide, compared to McDonald&apos;s 32,737.

McDonald&apos;s is still the Big Mac when it come to making money. The burger chain reported $24 billion in revenue last year, compared to Subway&apos;s $15.2 billion.

But when you&apos;re hungry and in need of something fast, what would you rather have? A $5 foot-long at Subway, or a cheeseburger and fries at McDonald&apos;s? +40

Cheese&amp;herb bread with roast beef, pickles, mustard, cucumbers, cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato - not the healthiest thing but it tastes amazing and it&apos;s a whole lot healthier than McCrappold&apos;s! reply PapaBC March 11, 2011 15:57:01 Subway +1 Actually If given the choice -- Baja Fresh reply Lerro DeHazel March 11, 2011 15:52:31 Subway I think that it gets down to which one honors the Coupons that are sent either through the Snail Mail or else clipped out of the weekend paper . . . reply Dory_Maee(: March 11, 2011 15:46:19 Subway +1 I love subway. reply PaRtYgIRl5593 March 11, 2011 15:41:22 McDonald&apos;s +1 reply VX March 11, 2011 15:36:44 Subway +1 I like subway and have not eaten at Mc D&apos;s in years! reply Assault March 11, 2011 15:30:13 Subway +1 Unless I&apos;m tokin cause Mickey D&apos;s got that dollar menu. reply Dogzebra March 11, 2011 15:28:12 Subway +1 I&apos;ll never see the public&apos;s facination with McDonalds. Their burgers were never that good tasting and their fries are run of the mill, while the portions got smaller the prices went up. The menus may have gotten bigger, but for the price, I&apos;d rather eat a luncheon meat sandwhich from Subway or go to a real sit down restaurant. reply txmoni7 March 11, 2011 15:26:05 Subway +1 without a doubt! reply Devoted March 11, 2011 15:22:39 McDonald&apos;s +1 reply JesseGreathouse March 11, 2011 15:20:50 McDonald&apos;s +1 I hate Subway. Their food is ok but the service is usually worse than macdonalds. I hate watching those kids with all their zits and greasy faces touch my food. I know it&apos;s the same disgusting kids working at mcdonalds but at micky dees I don&apos;t have to watch them touch my food.

The worse thing about subway is the way their service queue is set up. They&apos;ve made it so they cannot produce multiple food orders concurrently. Every sandwich has to be built in the exact order of the customers in their line. This makes the lines VERY SLOW. Whenever my wife asks me to get subway I hate it because I know I&apos;m going to be standing in line for at least 15 to 20 minutes. This is absolutely the dumbest way to design a service queue.

At any other fast food restaurant, they take your order and you get to sit down and wait while they prepare it. Or at least if you&apos;re in line at the drive through, they can make your food and have it ready before you get to the window. At subway this is not the case, have to stand and wait for everyones food to be prepared before they can even start on your order. To make matters worse, instead of having standard ingredients for all their products, they ask the customer about every little ingredient of what they want on their sandwich, this makes the process e...

Whoever thought that idea would equate well to good service should be shot. I don&apos;t need to rent someone elses hands for 5 dollars to put together a sandwich, I might as well make it on my own. At least if I made my own sandwich I wouldn&apos;t have to stand in line and wait for 10 other people to have theirs made before me. (more) reply Niki A. March 11, 2011 15:17:26 McDonald&apos;s +1 honestly both depending on my mood that day reply photodude March 11, 2011 15:14:56 Subway +1 a little better for you reply Marshal... to photodude March 11, 2011 17:43:08 Unless you get the prime rib, and that thing is 50% fat and gristle. reply 377385 March 11, 2011 15:12:23 Subway +1 Health wise they are probably about the same as much as subway wants you to think differently, but I would just prefer a steak and cheese sub over a big mac if I had to choose one or the other. reply Jen March 11, 2011 14:38:15 Subway +1 No contest here. reply Blondie:) March 11, 2011 14:36:06 Subway +1 Most of the time subway but I cant always afford it :( reply
