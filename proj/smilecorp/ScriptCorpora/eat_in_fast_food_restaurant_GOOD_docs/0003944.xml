 Sunday Short–Anton Part One of Three July 8th, 2012 
 So as the title suggests, this is part one of three for Anton. Anton is another character from the Empire series. Enjoy his short story. 

It was dark, the sun was likely shinning brightly high in the sky behind the black clouds, but it was dark on the cold city streets. The temperature had plummeted after record highs all week and the wind carried an extra chill, a sign that winter was around the corner. Winter was his favorite season, it was always easier to get warm than it was to cool down as far as he was concerned. Besides he always thought that the snow looked serene when it fell in large flakes from the sky. Snow wasn’t what was coming that day though. No, it would be a sharp and bitter cold rain that the ominous black clouds were threatening to drop in large amounts on the city. It had rained earlier that day, releasing them from their heat wave and giving the city a good dousing, but since then the dark clouds seemed to just linger above them waiting for an opportune moment to release their stores. Like in the movies when everything had gone from bad to terrible and it seemed like it just couldn’t get any worse and then the rumble of thunder in the distance, perhaps a flash of lightning, and then the release of ran, pouring down on the poor fool already feeling like he was at the lowest point in his life. Movies had the opportunity to create that kind of irony. Real life, thankfully, didn’t always operate like that. Sure there were days where you felt like it couldn’t get any worse, and then the rain came proving just how wrong you were, but it wasn’t as easily predictable. People had bad days when the sun was shinning and in all rights they should have felt uplifted in its golden rays. Bad days were just a part of life.

Pulling his coat in a little closer he darted across the usually busy street when there was a momentary pause in the traffic. Ducking his way down a side street before carefully glancing over his shoulder, he shuddered. There was that feeling, the feeling of being watched. It lingered, making him nervous, and had him checking his surroundings more times than he normally would have, but then again the package he was on his way to pick up had him nervous to begin with.

The call had come shortly after three in the morning, an hour after he had originally gone to bed. He could feel every aching bone and muscle in his body as he turned over and swatted at his phone, thinking it was nothing more than his alarm clock buzzing its annoying reminder that it was time to get up. It was only as he hit the device numerous times, knocking it off of the night stand and listening to it still ringing loudly and vibrating its way across the hardwood floors of his bedroom that he began to realize it was the phone. The caller was a peculiar sounding man, likely having masked his voice with one of the throw away voice synthesizers they could buy on the black market in bulk. His early morning caller had come across as almost paranoid and at times he swore he could hear the man chewing away at his lip, hesitating as he attempted to arrange a meeting.

He had offered to go out and meet the caller right then, assuming whatever it was this man was going to deliver to him was rather important considering the man had woken him at the ungodly hour to begin with, but the man quickly rejected the idea. Insisting it would be better for them to meet the next day at noon, at a public restaurant on the outskirts of the city. Not far from public transit, the restaurant was nothing more than one of the old heritage homes converted into a restaurant. Rather posh for his taste, but he had dressed appropriately in black slacks and a dark red dress shirt. Not bothering with the tie, he left his dress shirt un-tucked and with the top set of buttons undone. His black hair had been styled properly for its short length, which for him usually meant it was brushed and his fingers had been run through it on more than one occasion to allow it to fall naturally. With black dress shoes, and the black overcoat he looked like the business man and not the street fighter/assassin he was.

One of the best shots in the trade, he worked for a group of mercenaries under the employment of a woman he had enjoyed more than a few romps with. Her name was Danika; she had short blonde hair and gorgeous hazel eyes that he often thought were more like gold. Her skin a neutral color and her six foot height often played well with the boys but she had a larger frame than most woman and she had been the one to teach him how to street fight. Sure he knew combat, but street fighting was nothing like the martial arts he had learned, it was dirty and it had no rules or fancy etiquette. Anything went, and if you lived at the end of it, you were considered “good” or at the very least lucky.

“Reservation?” An older man, who looked like he had more class in his pinky finger than he had in his entire body, interrupted his train of thought as he darted up the small set of cement stairs and through the double glass doors. Perhaps it was his imagination, but he felt like the man was looking down on him, wondering what he was even doing there. Didn’t matter how much he had already dressed the part, he still didn’t fit in–probably should have worn the tie.

A sly grin crossing his face he nodded his head. “Under Geoff,” he spoke to the man, whose mannerisms changed so quickly he felt like he could have gotten whiplash from it. It was like night and day, the stiff back nature became lose and hunched over as if to cower back and away. His eyes, once crudely looking over him, now looked all around him in an almost paranoid manner.

“Ah Monsieur Anton,” the host spoke more graciously, even bowing his head a slight amount. “Right this way si vu plait, ” he added before leading the way into the restaurant.
 0 Posted in Rambling On | Up Down and all Around July 7th, 2012 
As many of you might already know, I’m one of the worst people in the world to keep a schedule. I love procrastination, right up until I realize I have so few hours left to accomplish something that I should have spent days working on. The only real way for me to keep to a schedule is to fool myself into thinking that scheduled item is due much sooner than it actually is.

Right now I’m in the midst of planning my wedding, we set the date for June 15, 2013 and I’ll be married downtown at the First Baptist Church. It’s exciting and scary at the same time. The scary comes from the amount of tasks that need to be completed and for someone who loves to procrastinate well…that’s going to be a bit of a challenge. I’m probably one of the worst planners in the world, but I have my lists and of course my bridesmaids who have assured me that they will help me with whatever I need. Of course, much of this stuff has timing. When you look for a dress, when you look for the bridesmaid dresses…when you book the church, the reception hall, the photographer, the DJ…all of these things come at a time and getting those timing right can be a bit of a challenge, but today I plan to head out and buy a planner, of course I’ve heard they can be a bit pricey but for someone as disorganized as I am, it’s probably an investment worth making!

So the wedding has me, as one of my coworkers likes to tell me, in bride-brain. A lot of the time I’m thinking of how I can do this, where I can do that and how to be organized for this. I expect there will be a multitude of things that go wrong, but I do hope to minimize those‘things’and keep everything else moving forward.

This earlier date also has me working out more than I used to (Well I went from zero to an hour a day…when my legs aren’t under complete and utter protest) which means my time is pretty scattered–as is evident by the fact I wrote this post at 9:30 this morning and it’s now 11:00pm and I’m trying to finish it up.

Anywa, the long story short means that the short stories will update on the Sundays but odds are they will continue to be parts. And Expect me to be posting little tidbits about the wedding as I continue to work on the wonderful event!

So it’s Sunday and I forgot how quickly Sunday comes around. There will be no Sunday Short this week. I will have one up next week.
 0 Posted in Rambling On | Sunday Short–Anya (Part Two) June 24th, 2012 
 This is the end of the Anya story, it’s actually really short. I discovered I wanted the more open ending. Enjoy! 

“I learned from some of the best,” his voice purred into her ear, “why don’t you spend the night learning a trick or two?”
Fingers running into his hair, and tugging on it roughly as she felt his teeth biting into her shoulder, Anya allowed her body to respond to his affection – not that she really could have stopped it. As his hand ran up her body she licked his lips and sharply pulled away from him. “Or maybe I’ll be teaching you.” She told him with a wink as she began to walk away. He wouldn’t see morning and so she could have walked him into the Kremlin throne room and showed him all of their plans and it wouldn’t have mattered.
Confident and full of sass, she led the man along behind her. She led him out of the club and back to her apartment where she put the cute little ass he had and his forceful nature to good use. There was no sense wasting a perfectly good opportunity, and besides that he had riled her up in the club to begin with. After a few hours and a decent romp or two later, Anya lay on the bed beside the exhausted man and smiled charmingly as she crawled up on top of his body.
“Again?” He looked up at her, a sparkle in his eye suggested he liked the idea, however his near gasping for air told her that wasn’t likely to be much more than a flop. Still while he thought that’s what she wanted, she leaned forward and pressed her lips against his neck. Her hands carefully slide a syringe from the nightstand’s top drawer, though she suspected she could have outright opened the drawer and pulled it out and he still would have been thinking about the curves her body and not about what she was doing. Men were practically all the same, the blood could only flow to one head at a time and right now all his blood was down below trying to ramp himself up for one more go. Sure during their first excursion he had tried a few questions between moans and grunts, mostly non-consequential information, a ramp up for the big ones. Knowing he’d never make it out of the room to relay any of the information he did obtain, Anya cared little in giving him the answers to his questions. It built a false sense of the upper hand, a feeling that he had control of the situation, allowing him to see her as some bimbo woman who never should have made it into the ranks of the KGB.
The syringe in hand she felt a grin crossing her lips – too easy. Jabbing it into the side of his neck she watched his eyes go wide quickly. His hands tried to force her off of him, but she clenched her legs together to hold her place. Like a small child throwing a tantrum, his arms were flailing and he was bucking, trying to shove her off of him as his eyes rolled back. His muscles relaxed, and a small amount of drool escaped from the corner of his lips.
A satisfactory smirk on her face, she slipped off of him, dressing herself back in her uniform before looking at his naked form. Poor fool hadn’t known what he was walking into. He had never seen her coming. Of course, he wasn’t dead yet, but when he woke he would be weak, and feeling more than helpful. In the end of it all the fool would never see the sun rise again and the KGB would know what the CIA were snooping for in Moscow.
 0 Posted in Rambling On | Sunday Short–Anya (Part 1) June 16th, 2012 
 My original intention was to do Amelia for my short today, however, feeling the need to reconnect with Anya had me doing a short on her. This is another character from the Empire Series. Anya Sergeevna Masnova. This is part One of Two, Part two goes up next week. 

It looked good on her, the KGB uniform. Her auburn hair pulled up in a thick ponytail at the top of her head and flowing down about her shoulders and just a little past them. The uniform consisted of three different colors, a hunter green vest, highlighted with brass colored buttons, a fern green dress shirt with a loop design in a yellow buff color and dark green, almost black, slacks or skirt. While the skirt was far from practical for her duties, she tended to enjoy wearing it when she went out after her duties. The uniform itself was a deterrent to anyone that might have thought twice about mugging her and it had extra benefits – people respected, and feared, the uniform. It was a comforting state for her to see that and to know that no one would ever mess with her again.
With pale skin, dark green eyes, and a small frame that made her look almost childlike, she was considered the runt of her family. The smaller of the two children who would do nothing better than serve another as an administrative assistant or housewife. Her older brother, who also happened to be her twin brother, was the pride and joy of their parents. They showered him with praise and boasted his achievements in their tightly-knit circles of friends. He was their greatest achievement and she was just there. They had been furious when she followed her brother into KGB training, disregarding the proper ways a lady should behave. Every time she spoke to them, they told her she’d never make it that she would never survive the training and that it was a job for men. Women were few and far between within the KGB. While the rest of the world had adapted much more efficiently to women within their military and secret service ranks, the KGB still had old school mentality and those women that did attempt to make it in went through a far more brutal training than their male peers would ever dream of experiencing.
She had withstood the hazing and the long nights of what should have been classified as slow torture and at the end of it, she stood by her brother’s side as they graduated from their combat training. Of course the next step had been to go to university, or college, and find a degree that would benefit the agency – the next step if you wanted to become an officer. There were some within the agency who opted not to go down that path, and while they would never make captain, lieutenant or commander even, they were content to be just an everyday agent of the KGB. That was not for Anya; no, she wanted to be better than her brother, better than the favorite child of her family.
She took classes on human psychology where she learned her best developed skill, manipulation. While perhaps she had missed the art of helping someone with her education, she had learned the little ways in which she could ensure the outcome was nearly always to her benefit. She finished off with a bachelor’s degree, and took her first rank as an officer – Lieutenant Anya Sergeevna Masnova. Of course Alexander, her twin, had finished ahead of her with Captain Alexander Sergeevich Masnov, but the real reward had been the look on her parents’ faces when she stood before them in the pristine dress uniform of the KGB.
Hugging every curve of her body, the uniform looked better on her than any dress her parents would have shoved her into – at least that was her opinion. Fixing a few loose strands of hair she smiled at the mirror, at the woman looking back at her. She was dressed to kill, and if she was lucky she would get to do that.
She slipped out of the bathroom and slid her feet into a pair of black stiletto shoes. Although the shoes were far from being suitable for running, they were great for attracting men, particularly nosey American spies who thought bedding a weak female KGB agent would grant them access to all the information they needed. Just the thought of it made her scrunch up her nose, men were so quick to judge the woman they worked alongside, even her brother felt the need to protect her, often trying to shield her from harm and in the end annoying her and causing her twice the amount of pain. Giving her head a sharp shake, she pushed the thought out of her mind and left her one bedroom apartment to make her way down the street to the center of the city and popular club that had opened recently.
Anya had attended the club with her comrades on opening night and had spent more than one night drinking there since. The place was usually packed full of the younger agents and those that were trying to bed them. Being with an agent for the KGB was not only a sense of financial security it was like having a shield for the mischief that some of them got into. No one touched the property of another agent, not without permission and while Anya had considered the beau of another agent on more than one occasion she knew better than to cross that line.
Sliding into the club, without much regard for the line of civilians trying to get in, Anya made her way through the club to the bar where she picked up a drink and carefully took a look at the crowds. Now where is he…, she thought to herself as she sipped from the glass of vodka. She could drink with the best of them, and a few drinks were always welcomed before a night like the one she had planned. As her eyes caught the man she was most interested in, she fought back the grin twisting on her lips and instead swayed her way over to him, or rather past him. Her hips moving she walked past the man, bumping into his table, with no regard for an apology and moved over to the group of male agents just past him.
His attention falling to her, she pretended not to notice as she flirted with the two men. A soft smile, a brush of her legs, she made sure the target had all the right views as her body language suggested everything she would be looking for that night. Her hand brushed the face of the male agent, his grin growing as his arms came around her, grabbing her ass and pulling it towards him. She pretended to enjoy it, to enjoy the rough affection he had as he drew her in and chauvinistically told her exactly what he’d like to do with her.
Her skirt raising just a bit more she brushed her leg against the man’s inner thigh as she brought arms up around his neck, letting him talk. She wasn’t going to turn down a little dirty talk – it was fun. With her chest pressed in against him, she continued to flirt until finally breaking away and telling him maybe next time. She then proceeded to make her way back to the bar ensuring the agent she just left and the target had a good view of her as she did. He did sound like he would be fun, perhaps she’d have to keep him in mind for later, but as she walked away the target seemed to follow her over to the bar. “Not your type?” He asked her as he leaned in against the bar beside her.
“Oh he’s plenty my type, but if you give them what they want right away, they never come back for more.” Anya smirked at him.
With a light laugh the man tossed back his drink and then moved in close to the woman. “You enjoy stringing them along, playing with them and knowing you have absolute control. But I think what you crave is a man that can teach you all about control.” He roughly pulled her towards him. It was too easy and Anya would have laughed if it wouldn’t have ruined the situation. His hands daringly slid up her skirt causing her to grin as he squeezed her ass, sliding fingers under her panties but not doing much more than running them over her rear end. Perhaps she should enjoy a little romp with him before she takes him out. Seems he would be fairly pliable with a few more drinks and a decent screw. Getting him to bed with her wouldn’t be a challenge that was for certain. “You want a man to make you beg for it.” He pulled her forward. “Instead of you making them beg for a shot at getting into bed with that gorgeous ass.”
With another grin Anya started to pull back only to have him hold her tighter. She had to admit his tactics might have worked if it weren’t for the fact they had already made him as an American CIA operative. The trick was finding out how many more of them were lurking in the country. How many more operatives were putting their nose where it certainly didn’t belong. “I’m not done with you.” He whispered into her ear as he bit into the lobe. Oh he would be a fun little perk to her night if he kept his up. Her arms wrapping up around his neck she smirked back at him.
“I must say you do know how to play,” her lips twisted into a grin.
 0 Posted in Rambling On | Sunday Short : Steven Part Two June 3rd, 2012 
 This is the other half of the Steven story, so it’s actually rather short 

His feet carried him up the stairs of the building as if he had been running marathons since he was old enough to walk. There wasn’t even a thought for the exhaustion that would set in when he stopped moving as he rounded each bend and continued up to the top floor. Even if the elevator would have been faster taking him up, he had no way of knowing how long it would take to get down to him or if the power would remain on for the entire duration of the ride up. He had a strong suspicion it wasn’t staying on much longer and by the time he was half way up the stairs that suspicion became reality. The lights flickered twice before flashing out, and the stairwell became illuminated solely by the emergency lights stationed beside each of the fire alarm boxes. The alarm boxes that within seconds of the lights flashing began to ring, almost immediately filling the stairwells with people going in the opposite direction he was travelling in. Cursing it repeatedly he continued to force his way up to the top floor, bursting through the doors into the poshly decorated hallway and forcing his way past the scrambling civilians. Red and gold carpet, expensive paintings, and small elegantly furnished sitting areas all added to the appearance of a hotel rather than the condo it was.
When he came up the stairs he thought figuring out which unit he was going to be looking for would be a challenge but the swiss cheese walls gave the unit away. Rushing to the door he drew his weapon and paused only a moment to note there was no gunfire before he kicked in the door, leveling his weapon on the chest of the blonde target he had been following that night. “FBI FREEZE!” He shouted at her.
For a moment the woman didn’t move, her eyes stared back at him. She had leapt to her feet when the door was forced in, but now she just stood there, eyes cold and blankly staring at him, as if she were trying to logically decide what emotion she should be feeling in that moment. “CIA.” Her voice stated firmly as she lowered the weapon she had instinctively trained on him.
Without a word he moved forward and took her weapon from her, and tucked it into his waist band as he used one hand to carefully place his handcuffs onto her before the sweet smile crossed his lips. “I know.” He stated to her before sitting her down into the chair.
“What?” She looked shocked, if not confused by his statement, if he knew she was a cop what on earth was he doing arresting her anyway. Her hands were instinctively struggling; trying to pull free of the handcuffs she swore he had put on tighter than was necessary. Yet, he didn’t say a word to her as he walked over to the body of the man on the floor, feeling for the pulse she hadn’t felt a moment before and calling the shooting in on his radio. It would only be a few moments before local authorities and emergency crews were there anyway. The Fire alarm was ringing throughout the building but only now as all else had fallen quiet did Vicky even notice it.
“I said I know.” He spoke to her, as he put his gun away and pulled up another chair. Turning it backwards he sat on it and faced her, with his arms resting on the back and his head rested down against is arms.
“Then why on earth are you arresting me? I didn’t kill him. I was doing a job.”
“And I am doing mine,” he returned with a smile. “Your handler will be here soon enough.”
Vicky glared at him, a look he found rather amusing as he remained sitting there, only to look back as another older man walked into the apartment. “Agent McKenna.” He spoke as he stood up.
“Special Agent Jones.” The man returned with a nod of his head. CIA and FBI relations weren’t always the best but on occasion they seemed to get along well enough to be civil with each other. “I’m a busy man, so I hope your agency calling me out has a point.”
“My superiors will be more than happy to explain everything, but I figured you would prefer to transport your agent over to our headquarters.” Special Agent Jones stood up. Perhaps the smile was from the rather annoyed look on the blonde haired woman’s face, but more than likely it also came from the fact he was going to be able to get home and shower.
“I need to head up north Special Agent Jones, so I would prefer you explain to me now, why it is necessary for me to be here. And why my agent is in handcuffs at the moment.” With the older man had come the rescue crews and police officers that Special Agent Jones had been expecting. He imagined the only reason they hadn’t come in with their guns at the ready was because his superiors had already alerted them that the situation was under control and one of their agents was on the scene. Likely said ‘in command’ of the scene. That shower was becoming further away again.
Sighing, he shook his head and looked from the officers back to Agent McKenna, the CIA handler of the woman he had handcuffed and sat on a chair from the kitchen. “With all due respect Agent McKenna, the FBI would not involve you unless it was necessary. And your agent is in handcuffs because at this moment she’s under arrest. So if you would, the men behind you will accompany you and her to our headquarters where my superiors will be more than happy to explain everything to you.”
“Under arrest!” Vicky shouted, well practically screamed. “I wasn’t read my rights! I wasn’t given the right to a lawyer! Uncuff me this instant!”
“Enough Agent Johnson.” Agent McKenna cut her off and pulled her up by her arm and towards the other agents.
Special Agent Jones remained behind, without saying a single word to the leggy blonde as she was pulled out of the condo and led away in the handcuffs. There were reasons for everything.
 0 Posted in Rambling On | Not According to plan May 27th, 2012 
Well the plan had been to post the other half of the Steven short story today and I was on track for that when a million other little things came up, including the fact I’m just plain tired.
These reno projects are starting to drive me crazy! Thankfully we’re getting much closer to the finish line. I just need to do a few more things and we’ll be right as rain. Next week should be better, I’ll have the other half of the Steven Short up and hopefully build myself a buffer of short stories I can post on the Sundays that will allow me not to miss a Sunday. I don’t like holes in my archives!
 0 Posted in Rambling On | Sunday Short–Steven (Part One) May 20th, 2012 
 This is part one of two for the Sunday Shorts on Steven. I will try and get part two up during the week this week. However, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to with the baby shower happening this week :) With luck it’ll all be good.

This short is for Steven Jones another character from the Empire Series…
 

Why did he always have these assignments? Showering off the stink of urine and god knew what else was going to take him weeks. Yet, as he sat on the street corner shaking his cup at the beautiful women as they walked by in their miniskirts and low cut tops, he couldn’t help but appreciate the view. Long slender legs, killer hips and a strut that could have had him drooling, but instead he was offering a toothless grin up at each one of them begging for their loose coins. All this time waiting for the one person of interest to stalk by him, and all this time finding himself disappointed as she never showed up. Of course he had been waiting in that spot for the better part of three weeks now and each time he put on the filthy clothes and falsely limped his way over to his corner to sit on the musty blanket, he had no more and no less hope that she would come than he had the day before. Truthfully he wished his superiors would let this one go, but they seemed determined to catch the fly in their web.
It wasn’t a particularly warm night, but it wasn’t freezing either, and he could at least be thankful for that. He was from the south; the temperature here was truthfully always cold to him. The blasted locals constantly telling him it wasn’t cold didn’t quite understand his skin wasn’t as thick as theirs. They would be in shorts and a t-shirts and he would be looking for the nearest sweater. They could tell him he would adjust all they wanted, he would much rather be in California than here but he had to go where he was told. Temperature aside though it was a beautiful night. Brilliant buildings lit up the night’s sky and a full moon hung high in the sky gazing down on the earth.
Another group of giggling girls strolled past him paying him little to no attention despite him jiggling the cup in their direction. Of course he made more than a few dollars each night and some people brought him coffee or feed, but he could think of a few activities he would much rather be doing at that moment. It was frustrating as each night would press on and he would turn up nothing, but this night was not going to be one of them. Tonight was certainly going to be different. His dark blue eyes buried behind hazel contacts took in the platinum blonde bee-lining for the same club the gaggle of girls had been headed for. She was dressed to kill, with black knee-high boots, spiked heels, a skin tight black leather skirt that was leaving very little to his imagination and a tight fitting low cut tank top that left even less. With a sheer over shirt that was flaring at the sleeves he could barely see her tanned skin and bangle bracelets. With her hair pulled up in a loose bun of curls that fell around her face, there was no mistaking it, there was the target. They had been waiting for her long enough and as he jammed his cup up towards her and watched as she turned her nose up, huffed and walked around him, he was certainly careful to drop the small device into her handbag. A circular dot, no larger than a candy covered chocolate, fell to the bottom of the handbag without giving off so much as a hint of its presence as the woman continued on her way.
Waiting long enough for her to be out of sight range he limped away from his perch and vanished into one of the many darkened alleys New York City provided him with. It was only once he was a good distance away that he would call it in. “Package has been delivered.” He spoke simply into a small microphone clipped to the underside of his shirt sleeve and heard the quick confirmation through the earpiece that was nestled nearly invisibly in his ear. The order than followed next made him want to groan. He was only supposed to drop the device into her bag, and now he was being instructed to follow her, well, stay with her. There was no way that posh nightclub was going to let him waltz in there as he was in that moment, and he was certain he wouldn’t be washing the stench off of him with enough time to make it in there before she vanished.
Huffing he made his way back out onto the streets, positioning himself not far from the nightclub but this time in a more discreet manner. Whereas before he was sitting on the street nearly assaulting every person that walked by him begging for money, now he lay curled up on some old musty blankets feigning sleep and watching the night club’s doors from the shadows. How long he was going to be stuck there he had no way of knowing but he certainly hoped it was not going to be all night – he had been looking forward to that shower.
Hours seemed to pass, hours of him watching that door and waiting. He had begun to wonder if the blasted woman had slipped out the back and vanished on them. Had she found the device? Removed it and destroyed it? Close to calling it he saw her slip out of the club on the arm of a tall skinny man. The man stepped up to the two door sports car and opened the door for his target letting her slide into the passenger side. It was a car he could only ever dream of driving, and as the engines fired up and the pair zoomed off in a cloud of smoke he grumbled to himself. How on earth was he to keep up on foot?
Shoving himself up from the ground, he made his way in a slow limp away from anyone that might have been able to recognize him, slowly standing straighter and blending himself in with the others walking the sidewalks. Of course to truly blend in he would have to change, but for the moment everyone was so concerned with themselves they failed to notice him walking amongst them. That was the only plus of the big city, it was easy to slide along unnoticed. Everyone was so concerned with themselves that as the wise man once said, a person could die on the subway and no one would notice… at least no one would notice for a fair amount of time.
Reaching his beat up old FORD he slid into the driver’s seat and withdrew his cell phone from the center console. “Jones here, get me a trace, I need an address.” He spoke into the phone as he wiped some of the muck off of his face and stripped away the clothes. Damn the car was going to need a detailing. It was starting to smell as bad as he did at that moment. Truthfully he wanted to get a new car, but this job could be a big promotion for him, at least he was damn well hoping it was. It had better be worth SOMETHING.
As the address came in, he started up his car and began racing across the city. He needed a go order to move in on the target but he certainly didn’t want to be far from her when it came in. As he was driving he ordered a check on the man she had been with, quickly describing his long thinning hair, slender frame and estimated height. Though he was too far to get much in terms of his face he had an idea of where they should be looking. At night the streets weren’t nearly as packed as they were during the day but it was New York City, the city never slept and their streets were busier at night than most cities would experience during the height of rush hour. Steven truthfully wished they would all go home to bed as he darted down the streets as best he could. He would have preferred to use the sirens but imagined that his superiors wouldn’t have appreciated that too much. Instead he kept as close to the speed limit as he could and finally arrived at the address he was given a short while later. Just in time for the helicopter.
Green light or not he was going into the building as he watched a helicopter flying dangerously low to the building hovering towards the penthouse suite. Of course an exact address on condos were near impossible to pin point with a tracking dot, but he had a fair reason to believe the penthouse was exactly where he needed and wanted to be in that moment.

Part Two of the Sunday Shorts. This one is considerably shorter at 1,482 words. I thought about this and I don’t want to reveal much of the character, but I thought it would be a very neat little look at Kevin. Kevin is the ATA super genius and this is how he is“Found”I imagine I can do another brief intro into Kevin at a later date but for the moment, I enjoyed the simplicity of this one.

****

His tongue hung out the side of his mouth, his fingers raced across the black keyboard, where the letters were almost completely rubbed off. Media had lied in that they were in the future, well it was as far future as 2008 could really be considered, and they didn’t have virtual reality, people weren’t hard wired into their computers with technological advancements that were so far forward they had bred them a new world of terrorists. Sure a well-trained hacker could make himself millions without raising the smallest flag, but they were still using keyboards, mice and a ridiculous amount of skills. Memorizations of codes and speed were everything in the digital world, and some of the best hackers in the world were working in their parent’s basement out to prove they were better than the next guy. In truth he wasn’t really different. Camped out in the basement of his grandmother’s house, he had made himself his own haven. Six widescreen monitors were hooked up to a single high powered machine he had built from scratch. Giving it all the bells and whistles out there, the machine would hum at a nice even pace, and give off a faint blue glow that he found soothing, his grandmother on the other hand thought that it was nothing more than a nuisance and the hum was more of a racket than a soothing whirl. Three monitors on the desk, with two mounted on the wall above that and a sixth that was more of a pad down on the desk. The pad was the thinnest of the monitors and was more of a tablet than a monitor at all.

On the screen it displayed various commands that he would only glance at as he continued to enter a series of commands into the computer. Of course tonight was more of a dare than anything else and he tended to stay away from the more black and white legalities, it was a thrill he had been looking forward to. The basement’s overhead lights turned down low, a two litre bottle of coke on the desk beside him and a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips beside it and he was wired into the computer. The headset on his head blocked out the outside sounds that might have distracted him, and his bean bag chair made him comfortable. ‘This is going to be a wild ride’ he told himself.

Of the six monitors only one of them displayed anything recognizable. While five of the monitors showed lines of code that looked more like gibberish and passed across the screen at a speed that made the Matrix’s special effects of scrolling letters look like child’s play. Of course being the fan boy he was, his screen saver was those slow scrolling numbers and letters, and he modeled his programs to have a similar appearance of black screens with green text. The sixth screen displayed the CIA’s logo with a prompt for a user name and password. The screen was static, there was nothing being entered on it, nothing being changed or modified, at least nothing on the surface. To another looking in on the situation someone had logged out of the system and left their computer running, waiting for them to log back in. It was one of the hundreds of thousands of users that were doing just that with their computers. However, nothing really was as it seemed.

In the background of the screen he took apart the system piece by piece, as if it were a set of building blocks or legos that he was simply taking apart to build back together again. It was a trickier system than he had ever tried before, but the dare was simple. Get in, get proof you were in and get out without ever once raising a flag. Hah. He could do better than that. He could bring down their entire network in a blink of an eye, and be gone before they would ever stand a chance of bringing it back online. Of course the code was at times tricky, but that’s what the tablet screen was for. Leaving the keyboard, he pulled it towards him and began tapping his fingers against it. Bringing the files into view, decoding them like it was nothing more than a child’s puzzle, and he was in.

Proof, proof… what would be the best piece of proof he could get, of course the appeal of bringing down the network was there, weakening the all might American government generally gave you more enemies than friends. Then again they would never trace it back to him. The sixth screen was no longer displaying the CIA logo and log in screen, now it showed him files structures and databases containing some of the world’s greatest secrets. Fishing into the drawer on his desk he found something better than the chips, a bag of nerds. Oh how he loved the sugary sweets and munched on them as he continued to browse through the CIA files as nothing more than a ghost. He hadn’t even raised the slightest warning system and he could see if he had. Tapped into their hard line he was monitoring their security. Agencies like this often employed some of the crack genius kids that hacked into their systems to help them protect them and he had expected something a little more than this.

Boring. He huffed, it was too easy – at least he thought it was until the red flag went up. Someone was on to him. They had tapped into his signal and were currently trying to trace back to him. Oh a game. A challenge! Excited, he backed up in the system let his signal bounce off the millions of satellites in the world. A game of cat and mouse was easy for him to play, and as they tried to break through his defenses he snickered and gave them a run for their enormously high pay. Of course he still didn’t have his proof, might as well grab that on the way out of the system. Picking up a random file out of the database he copied it onto a USB stick.

The ATA initiative. Whatever that was, it wasn’t really any concern to him. He loaded it into the backup systems and then dropped the piece of information into the network, with a message for his darer. Give him a real challenge next time. Out of the system he relaxed and smiled to himself, satisfied. It was easy but at the same time enjoyable. Dropping the headset down, he grabbed the soda pop and took a few huge gulps of it before setting it back on the desk. Well that had taken him significantly less time than he had expected, what was next? Of course the answer to that came in a manner that had him curled up in the corner of his basement bedroom rocking back and forth after a blur of action he was not likely to ever sort out.
It had started with a simple knock on the door, one he hadn’t even heard, then a shout, a call that barely made his ears. He thought it was his grandfather, calling him up for dinner, but as he moved towards the stairs, armed men flooded into the basement. They shouted out commands at him and his heart began to race. Dressed in a pair of khaki shorts that went down past his knees and a lime green t-shirt displaying some popular slogan across the chest, he looked like one would expect a scrawny nerd to look like. Blond hair and green eyes with skin so pale it was likely he rarely made it out of his basement dwelling to see anything that even remotely resembled sunlight. He looked like he had never seen a gun let alone knew how to use one. The men were shouting commands at him in French and English. He didn’t speak a word of French but he knew what they wanted him to do. Yet panic set in as the high powered weapons were aimed on him. Panic set in quickly.

As one of the men stepped in too close, it was almost as if he had blacked out. He grabbed the barrel of the gun pushed it out to the side and brought his elbow sharply up into the man’s jaw. The agent stumbled back and he ripped the gun from his hands, only to curl inwards as the bullets began to fly all around him. Americans, they had the itchy trigger fingers, and while he had a weapon himself now he had taken cover and was hugging the weapon against his chest as he sat in the corner of the room.

“Kevin Greene, this is the CIA.”A male agent spoke firmly. His voice rough and drawn out, he was edging closer to the boy that was rocking back and forth mumbling something he could barely understand.“Kevin, we just want to talk.”

This is the first of the Sunday Short Stories I plan to work on. It’s just over 3700 words and features one of the characters from my novel series Empire. This short is meant as a small glimpse of one of the minor character’s pasts. It’s fun to expand on a character who doesn’t get a lot of love in the series. Especially when you can do so without giving away anything in the series. :) So I hope you take the time to read and enjoy the story. I realize it ends a little quickly, I might go back and modify that later, but as always constructive crits are VERY welcome.

***

Her nose scrunched up and her eyes narrowed she sneered at the homeless man shaking his cup of only a few loose coins at her. His clothes smelled of urine, and were stained with the mud of whatever ground he sat or slept on, and his facial features had long since lost any lively character they may have had. Hands shaking as he detoxed from whatever high he might have been on at the time, he continued to shake the cup at each stranger hoping one of them may take a little pity on his condition and drop a few coins into the cup. To her he was nothing more than filthy, a burden that she wanted nothing to do with. Yet, he paid no mind to her obvious distaste for him and continued begging as she clicked her heels against the sidewalk, walking away with her nose in the air.

It wasn’t a particularly cold night, but the air had a certain chill to it, a part of living in New York City she tended to despise. Though the nightlife was far more entertaining than her small town in Texas had been, she hated cold weather, and found it often ruined a well kept figure when she had to bulk up to stay warm. Dressed to kill that night, she had the black knee-high boots with the three inch spiked heel, the curvy figure accented by the skin tight black leather skirt, the shimmering silver, tight fitting, low cut tank top and the sheer over shirt that flared her sleeves. Bangle bracelets, large hooped earrings and a pendant that fell to just the right place on her chest all sparkled in the overhead street lights. Her tanned skin flawless, unless one looked close enough to discover the faint traces of concealer, and her silver and black eye shadow served only to enhance the blue of her eyes. All of it was topped off by the long platinum blonde hair that was pulled up into bundle of curls on the top of her head. A few loose strands had fallen out to frame her face, but rather than place them back up, she simple brushed them to the side and continued on her beeline for the night club.

A high end nightclub on the upper east side, was exactly the place she wanted to be on a Friday night. It was where everyone should want to be. At least that was the way she saw it. The line for the club reached halfway around the block and two large black men stood with their hands clasped before them at the front of it. The velvet red carpet leading off into the club started at the red rope line divider placed perfectly between the two men. Bouncers were meant to be intimidating, and these two by far did the job. Each of them looked like they were at one time WWF champions, one was bald with a fair sized scar reaching from the top of his head down the left side of his face, and the other had short black hair and a look that could have made blood run cold. They stood there with a stone cold expression on their faces, staring out at the hundreds of people hoping to get in, as if nothing in the world could make them flinch in their positions. Though plenty of women tried, they brushed their hands on their chests, their legs against their sides and batted long eyelashes up at them, pouting a little pretty please in their direction but it changed nothing. If anything the men appeared to be trying to hold back laughter at how often this happened and how little of an effect it had.

Between the two men there was also a third–almost midget by comparison–man. This guy had the business suit, the blonde wavy locks, and the smug grin that suggested he enjoyed the power of deciding who was let in and who wasn’t. He was the man she wanted at this moment, and as she walked past the entire line right up to him she knew she’d get him too. It was not a low cut top, long legs or even batting eyelashes that was going to win her favor with him, no this man had that thrown at him every night, he’d become impervious to it. Yet, he wasn’t going to be a hard nut to crack either.

“Back of the line.”He spoke in an accent that was easily placed as coming from Jersey. They all had distinct accents and while she should have had a Texas one, her voice was instead more like a purr of unaccented English as she leaned over the line, pulling him by his tie closer to her, and whispering a very simple proposition into his ear. Whether it had been sexual or monetary one it wasn’t clear, but what was clear was that as soon as she released his tie from her fingers, he carefully lifted up the rope line and she moved with beautifully swaying hips past, not once looking back at the suckers still standing in the lineup.

Moving into the club she smirked as the hipster music filled her ears and the chic design of the multi-level club enchanted her eyes. It was a place of the filthy rich and it streamed from the high end finishes and the well dressed patrons. Jeans and t-shirts were a fashion faux pas in a place like this, and the shorter the skirt on the women the better. Something she knew she’d fit right in with, as her own skirt was riding half way up her thighs leaving very little up to the imagination. Turning her fair share of heads she waltz up to the bar and ordered a double shot before downing them back and getting herself a long island ice tea to hold.

Round in shape, the club had three floors in total, the ground floor was made up of a large dance floor and a horse shoe shaped bar surrounding it. Stairs were on either side of the bar, each leading up to the second level where tables, booths, and lounge areas could be found. The tables were all black iron, matching the rails that overlooked the dance floor and the chairs had that nouveau design look to them, as they all had peculiar shapes and were far from looking like they might be comfortable. The walls on the first level were made up of mirrors that reflected the lights and were likely very trippy for the celebrities that were within the club looking for a different kind of fun. The third floor however was where she really wanted to be, the third floor was made up of pool tables and probably some of the richest men and women the city had to offer. Whether their money was clean or dirty, they were up there, spending it on whatever tickled their fancy. Nearly completely closed off there was only a small circle opening at the top where they too could look down on the dance floor and watch the women dancing in no manner that should ever be considered decent.

Getting up there though usually required knowing someone, as bouncers blocked every stair case. Slightly more difficult than getting into the club, but she was, if anything, resourceful. Walking up the stairs she made her way up onto the second level, taking in the sights of the club, wondering why she hadn’t bothered to come here before, it was everything she could have wanted and had plenty that were just her type in there.

All she needed was the right opportunity and she forced back the smirk that crept up onto her face as that opportunity presented itself to her. She watched one of the men walking down from the third floor, watched as he walked with his chest puffed out, eyeing up the women on the lower floors as he continued to make his way for the ground floor. He was on the prowl, it was in his eyes, in his body language and she wasn’t against using it. Drink still in hand she made her way absently up the iron stairs until carefully crashing into him as he made his way down. Ensuring maximum spillage of her drink, all over his dark blue dress shirt, and down the neatly pressed slacks. The man had a copper hair color and lively eyes that she could only describe as amber. Dressed in what was a clean pair of slacks, and a tight fitting dark blue dress shirt that had the cuffs rolled up while the top of the shirt was left open to expose a bare chest, the man looked far from being impressed over the latest addition to his outfit, the spilt long island ice tea. Yet when his eyes met hers and she gave him the batting eyelashes and the small fake tears he melted almost instantly.“Oh I’m so sorry!”She exclaimed.“My boot caught on the stair and I tripped.”It likely helped that her body had fallen into his and his hands as he pulled her straight could feel the curvy features of a well toned body, but she figured she could have gotten by on her acting alone.

The silk shirt was likely ruined but the man shook his head and told her not to worry about it, he had begun to walk away–something she hadn’t expected–when he turned around and faced her.“Do you dance?”He asked her and she knew in that moment she had him. A sheepish nod before she took his extended hand and she was moving with him onto the dance floor. Of course like most men this poor sap’s dance moves consisted of bobbing his head and waving his hands around while grabbing onto the bodies of any of the women that pressed themselves up against them. She however was not about to let that be just about anyone, and as the women on the dance floor fought for his attention she made sure to keep it. He wasn’t who she wanted, but he would get her closer to him.

His hands roaming all over her, she let him grab whatever it was he wanted, and giggled like she enjoyed it. A few songs in, and he wanted a drink.“A long island ice tea was it?”He spoke with a smirk as he brought her, arm around her, to the bar and ordered them both a drink. Replacing the drink she had lost on the stairs and getting himself a Heineken beer. From there it was up to the place she really wanted to be, and without even the slightest hiccup she was past the bouncer and on the third floor where she could almost smell the money on the saps. It didn’t take her long to ditch the man she had used like a free ticket to get up there. Opportunity knocked and she left the man in the arms of one of the waitresses as she wandered around the lavishly decorated lounge to the pool tables. There he was, the man she had made this trek for. Tall and slender, too much so in her opinion, the man had long blond hair that reached halfway down his back and was thin enough that it was likely he was also balding. It was tied in a loose ponytail but it didn’t stop it from falling onto the pool table as he leaned over to take a shot. The table surrounded by women, and men of varying sizes looked more like it was part of a competition than a friendly wager. Then again the amount of money on the side table that was part of the bet also looked like it was the prize for a competition. As he lined up his shot, she could see his opponent chewing at the inside of his lip. Honestly he looked like he might very well pass out at any moment, as a bead of sweat ran down his forehead and his eyes darted towards the pile of money repeatedly. Rounder, the man was also older, and had a shining golden ring on his left hand ring finger and likely a wife at home that had no idea he was here gambling against someone who could be playing pool professionally. The cue ball glided across the table, banking off of the called banks before connecting with the eight ball for a smooth glide into the corner pocket. It was a beautiful shot and the man who made it stood up straight, his 6’4 height catching her a little off guard as he looked across at the man who’d likely lost more than a good portion of his wealth to a big mouth and a pool shark. The man’s face was redder than a blazing inferno in that moment and his hands gripped the cue with white knuckles. Yet, before he could whip it around and act out on all the frustration that was pouring from his body language, the other men at the table had him down on the ground and disarmed while the winner paid no attention to him and enjoyed the female companions that were now showering him with attention. It was likely they were more interested in his money than him, but he was filthy rich who cared? He certainly didn’t as he kissed each one on the head and laughed as his opponent was dragged kicking and screaming off to the stairs and then‘accidentally’pushed down them.

Clapping her hands, she walked towards the winner, and made sure to smirk as she propped herself up on the table, not bothering with throwing herself at him. He had enough women doing that, no she wanted him to come to her. Her fingers pulling the eight ball free of the pocket, she looked it over, and turned it in her hands.“Well played.”She complimented him,“But how about you play with a real opponent, and not some rich weasel you can easily push over.”

Laughing the man watched her, not taking her challenge seriously he sat back on a stool and looked over at her. He was still a male and so the exposed skin and skimpy outfit was noted, but it was obvious that at that moment he had no intentions of taking her up on her offer.“And who would the real challenge be sweet heart? Certainly not yourself.”He grinned.“Unless of course you want to try your luck in the bedroom. I wouldn’t mind taking your little ass for a ride.”

Why were they always crude? She thought to herself before slipping off the table, and picking up the right cue. Tossing the eight ball back on the table, she waltzed back towards the table and bent over providing the cocky son of a bitch with just the right view before simply calling out the shot like she had done it hundreds of times before. Her shot was perfect, and had as much grace as his had before her.“Of course, if you’re afraid to lose, I will understand.”She stood straight tossing her loose strands of hair over her shoulder as the open mouthed man stared at her. It wasn’t that he didn’t expect women to be any good at pool, he just hadn’t met one that was as good as he was. The grin replaced the shock quickly and he pushed away from the women that were hanging off of him–much to their disappointment–before making his way over to her. His hands resting down on the pool table on either side of her he paused as he took in the sweet scent of her vanilla perfume.“And what will be the stakes there sweetheart?”

“Why don’t I make it interesting for you.”She smirked back at him, her manicured hand pushing into his chest as she shoved him back a few steps. Walking around him now, she took the chalk hanging from the wall and brushed the top of the cue, carefully blowing away the excess.“You win, you get to take this ass for a ride.”She smiled at him.

“And if you win?”He smiled back at her, obviously interested in this little wager so far.“Though I don’t think it would matter, since I doubt it’ll be an issue.”He had confidence coming out his ears.

With a small laugh she walked past him now, her finger brushing under his chin as she paused before him.“The money you just took off the poor fool before me, and you buy me a drink.”She returned before stepping up to the head of the table.“Ladies break.”She told him, without giving him much of an option. In his dumbfounded state he didn’t really seem to care, either. Instead he took his cue from one of the men that had helped his previous opponent find his way downstairs, and readied for his upcoming win. To him this was going to be a walk in the park and while she knew how to sweep the table, never giving him a chance to even take a shot, it wouldn’t get her anywhere. She made it a challenge for him but in the end she let him have the win and let him claim his prize.

Arms wrapping around her, she fought the instinct to squirm and instead grinned up at him.“My my, let’s hope you ride as well as you play then.”She spoke in a sweet tone as he once again leaned in to take in her scent.“Even better.”He returned and she found herself wanting to roll her eyes. Where did they get these attitudes?

She didn’t argue though when he took her hand and led her away from the crowds of now disappointed women towards the lower level. They were leaving much sooner than she had anticipated, then again pool was such a dirty game if one spent enough time thinking about it. Perhaps he was more wound up than she had originally thought, any way it went it was better, she’d get what she wanted soon enough. It was out onto the cool street, his arm around her as he tossed keys to a valet that promptly brought the sports car around. Sliding into the passenger seat she made herself comfortable and was certain to buckle up. These rich types were all the same. They liked speed, and they didn’t care how reckless they were with it. All the better in this case though, the sooner this was over with the better.

It had taken little more than ten minutes to get to his condo, and she was far from surprised when he brought her up to the penthouse suite at the top of the overpriced building. The suite was breathtaking with panoramic views of the city, beautiful oak floors and neutral toned walls. Expensive modern furniture and a kitchen that was likely rarely used but would have been a chefs dream. It had all the signs of a bachelor though with the shag carpets, the lack of flowers, and personal pictures and the monotone colors. Once inside though he was quick to move in close, his hands attempting to almost instantly remove her clothes as he acted on the lust of a teenager.“Hey…hey now.”She laughed, pulling back a bit.“Are we alone?”

“Of course.”He returned, pulling her back into him, expecting the entertainment he had rightly won, only to be shocked as her voice changed and the word“Perfect”rolled off of her tongue in almost a purr. Her elbow snapping up into his lower jaw, she spun sharply sweeping him off of his feet as she leveled a small pistol on his skull. Pressing her boot down onto the precious jewels she smiled down at him.“Because you and I, need to have a little chat.”She grinned as she watched his face pale, his body tremble as fear was plastered all over his eyes.

“W…w…who are you?”He stuttered out, having never seen this coming. Truthfully he should have, but men rarely saw what was right before them when they allowed the wrong head to do all the thinking.

“Victoria, but you can call me Vicky.”She told him. Her name would mean nothing in the end, he wasn’t leaving that condo alive. But just how much he wasn’t leaving it alive she had no idea. Her mouth had opened to ask the important questions when the sound of a helicopter caught her attention. Turning swiftly she barely had enough time to throw herself out of the line of fire as the machine gun opened fire shattering the floor to ceiling windows that had provided such a sensational view of the city only moments earlier. Her man was nothing more than Swiss cheese as the helicopter lifted back up into the air, flying away from the scene it had just created and Vicky stared out at him, with her heart racing. That had been closer than she had ever wanted and she was cursing up a storm as she crouched low to the ground and made her way across the blood stained floor to the victim. There was no use checking for a pulse, he had likely died rather quickly, but her fingers felt his neck anyway and she pulled back just as the door to the condo flew open. Kicked in, it slammed into the wall before falling back towards the person who kicked as Vicky leapt to her feet and leveled her weapon on the man. Her eyes widened for only a moment as she stared back at the man she had seen earlier that night. The scent of urine on his clothes almost overpowered the scent of blood.“FBI FREEZE.”The man shouted, his gun aimed steadily on her chest.

At that moment, she wasn’t sure if she wanted to laugh or if she wanted to cry.“CIA.”She stated firmly, as she lowered her weapon and allowed the man to take it from her. Somewhere someone screwed up and when she found them, she was going to make sure they paid.
