 Not really Pizza Planet! 

 Advantages: Nice pizzas
 Disadvantages: Small pizzas and poor decoration.


...The advantage of counter service restaurants at Walt Disney World in Orlando is that you don?t need to make an Advance Dining Reservation, you can just stroll up when you are feeling peckish and you don?t have to plan your vacation around the ADRs you may have booked 180days before to guarantee a reservation.

Disney Hollywood Studios has several counter service options and the one we use most frequently is Toy Story Pizza Planet. This restaurant is located in the Muppet Show courtyard so is best avoided just after a 3D Muppet presentation as it gets very busy. It takes Disney Quick Service Plan and Snack credits for people on those schemes. It is open for both lunch and dinner. The restaurant has always been very clean whenever we have visited.

Out of all the Disney restaurants I have visited I must say this one is probably the most...

 Fabulous Bar&amp;Restaurant in the Heart of Glasgow 

 Advantages: great bar&amp;amazing food
 Disadvantages: none


...Urban Bar and Brasserie is a fabulous restaurant and bar right in the heart of Glasgow city centre, located in St Vincent Street right round the corner from Buchanan Street one of Glasgow&apos;s premier shopping destinations it is the perfect place for a pit stop from shopping, a night out, a romantic dinner or a few cocktails. 

It is located in one of the impressive old buildings which was formerly the Bank of England&apos;s Scottish Headquarters. The building has been refurbished sympathetically and makes for an impressive bar and restaurant. As you climb the small set of stairs and enter through the arched entrance way you enter into a warm and welcoming venue full of buzz and atmosphere. The bar is the first place that you find and is a cosy clubby style feel with a main bar area and a small wood paneled room off to the side (a kind of cosy...

Review of Urban Bar&amp;Brasserie, Glasgow 
 
 Pizza as good as that at any restaurant - at home! 

 Advantages: How I make proper restaurant style pizza at home
 Disadvantages: You might prefer to ring for a takeaway?


...This pizza maker makes wonderful pizza, as good as any that you would eat at a restaurant if you get it right. 

I would have to say I had never heard of this appliance or considered buying one, but we all love food in my family, so when we sampled the pizza that a friend&apos;s husband had made with one of these we were hooked. Seeing him in action and turning out pizzas that were better than those I had eaten in many restaurants was a really good selling point. I had to have one! 

I purchased my pizza cooker online at amazon, and paid 49.99 at the time. I have also seen this particular model in Bentalls department store in the kitchen section.

What is it?

The pizza cooker is a table top cooker with a proper pizza stone and heating elements above and below the stone. It looks a bit like a clam shell, it opens up to reveal...
