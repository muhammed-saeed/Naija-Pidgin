JOB CORPS OVERSIGHT 



WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1995 

U.S. Senate, 
Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 

Washington, DC. 
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:55 a.m., in room 
SD-430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Kassebaum 
(chairman of the committee) presiding. 

Present: Senators Kassebaum, Jeffords, Coats, Frist, DeWine, 
Ashcroft, Grorton, Pell, Dodd, Simon, Harkin, and Wellstone. 

Opening Statement of Senator Kassebaum 

The Chairman. It is a few minutes early, but since everyone is 
in place, I think we will go ahead and call to order the hearing this 
morning, which is the Job Corps oversight hearing. 

I would just like to say a couple of words first £U)out this hearing, 
which will be one of two on the Job Corps program. This follows 
up on the oversight hearing that was held last October, which I 
think is an important responsibility of this committee on all of the 
areas over which we have oversight. We must be able to look at it 
in an objective and thoughtful way and analyze both the strengths 
and weaknesses of whatever initiative we are undertaking. 

At the outset, I would like to thank the ranking member. Senator 
Kennedy, for agreeing to call that hearing last fall when he was 
chairman of this committee, and it is my regret that he has to be 
away today. I know he shares my interest in seeing that the Job 
Corps as well as any of the other Federal job training programs 
meet high standards and perform in a cost-effective manner. 

Job Corps is the oldest and most expensive Federal training pro- 
gram designed to help economically disadvantaged youth. It is also 
considered to be the best program of its kind. Labor Secretaiy 
Reich has described it as &quot;the jewel in the crown of the Federal joD 
training programs.&quot; 

Certainly there are many centers throughout the country that 
are performing effectively. These centers are offering skills training 
and education that are making a difference in the lives of many 
young people. Tomorrow, in fact, we will hear from the director of 
one of these centers. 

The goal of these hearings is to take a balanced, in-depth look 
at the realities of the Job Corps, the good and the bad. My own 
goal is neither to tear down the successes nor gloss over the fail- 
ures. It is to determine what works and what does not, so that Job 
Corps performs as intended, not merely as we hope it might. 

(1) 



A central issue is whether we want Job Corps to be a quasi-cor- 
rection s program or a training program. It has become a bit of 
each. The goal has become blurred and the mission, I would sug- 
gest, is ambiguous. 

There is growing evidence, however, that the rave reviews given 
Job Corps as a whole are based more on faith than on fact. Prior 
to the October hearing, the committee had not taken a close look 
at the Job Corps program in over 10 years. During that time, the 
program has enjoyed the strong support of Republicans and Demo- 
crats alike, despite a steady stream of negative reports issued by 
the Department of Labor&apos;s Inspector Greneral, going back into the 
late 1980&apos;s. Both parties share the responsibility for turning a blind 
eye toward the disturbing picture drawn by these reports. 

Last fall&apos;s hearing offered a sobering accoimt of low performance 
and poor accountability in the Job Corps, underscoring problems 
identified and documented by the inspector general. We learned, 
for example, that with an annual budget of $1.1 billion, Job Corps 
costs $23,000 per student per year; yet it only places 12 percent of 
those students in the jobs for which they are trained. 

We also found that 50 percent of Job Corps students drop out of 
the program after the first 6 months. 

We c£m no longer focus only on the success stories while sweep- 
ing the failures under the carpet. To do so is a disservice to the 
American taxpayer and, more importantly, to the young people who 
see Job Corps as a beacon of hope for their futures and who are 
committed to making their dreams a reality. 

Unfortunately, in far too many cases, these hopes are being 
dashed. The dreams of training and a good job are being replaced 
by the nightmare of an environment which tolerates unacceptable 
behavior in the interest of keeping up the numbers. 

Following last October&apos;s hearing, individuals from throughout the 
country began calling my office to offer disturbing accounts of ac- 
tivities within many Job Corps centers. I realize one has to be very 
cautious about calls of that nature, because some have vendettas 
that they wish to exercise. But I think the most troubling is the 
pattern of uncontrolled violence which has been a common thread 
among so many of these accounts. 

Just this past weekend, a Job Corps student was brutally mur- 
dered, and three other Job Corps students are being held for the 
murder in Knoxville, TN. Sadly, this is not an isolated case. 

Several of the witnesses who will appear today will tell their own 
stories about the violent actions which drove tnem away from the 
opportunity they thought they had found in Job Corps. I believe 
their testimony will offer a vivid portrait of the realities which lie 
behind the disappointing statistics of overall Job Corps perform- 
ance. 

Thank you. I turn now to Senator Pell, standing in for Senator 
Kennedy today. We welcome your opening comments. Senator Pell. 

Opening Statement of Senator Pell 

Senator Pell. I thank you. Madam Chair, and I thank you for 
holding these hearings. 

There has been a lot of discussion about the Job Corps, and I 
think it is a good idea to clear the air. At an earlier time, when 



the subject of Job Corps was being discussed by the Senate, I spoke 
about solutions to the important problems and challenges facing 
our young people — the need for originality and new ideas, the need 
for knowledge to combat ignorance, and above all, the need for 
broadening horizons for youth — so that each young man and young 
woman in the United States can develop the best of his or her tal- 
ents in a climate of maximum opportunity. 

To be precise, those remarks were made in March of 1964, 30 
years ago, during the debate on President Johnson&apos;s poverty pro- 
gram which, among others, created Job Corps. Those comments are 
just as relevant today as they were then and they continue to em- 
phasize the importance of the Job Corps. 

Thirty years later, the challenges that faced the youth in 1964 
are the challenges of young people today, as evidenced by the cur- 
rent appeal of ooot camps, teaching marketable skills to poverty 
youth still remains a novel idea. 

It is just as important today to replace ignorance with knowl- 
edge, and most importantly, to broaden the norizons of all of our 
young people, regardless of economic status. The Job Corps pro- 
gram is a vital cornerstone in our efforts to see that our young peo- 
ple can develop their talents to the best of their ability. 

It is my understanding that we will see and hear some pretty 
spectacular testimony during the next couple of days. As one of 
only two members of the committee to vote for the original creation 
of Job Corps, I have always been a strong supporter of it and be- 
lieve, as I said before, that Job Corps will probably show itself to 
be the most successful overall domestic program. 

I recognize that there are some warts, some flaws, but in gen- 
eral, I believe they have a pretty good record. That does not mean 
I am opposed to a responsible review, with the goal of making the 
program work better. It would be my hope that we might be able 
to make this program better able to expand the horizons of yet an- 
other generation. 

I might add my own personal hope that someday, we will get a 
Job Corps center in my own State. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Pell. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Kennedy follows:] 

Prepared STATEME^^^ of Senator Kennedy 

I commend Senator Kassebaum for convening this hearing to fol- 
low-up on the hearing we held last October to review one of our 
most important and successful education and training programs — 
the Job Corps. 

The Corps has been a success story for 30 years. It now serves 
more thgm 60,000 new students a year. Since its creation in 1964, 
it has helped prepare 1.5 million youth for jobs and careers. Seven 
out of every 10 Job Corps graduates get jobs, enter the military, 
or pursue further education after leaving the program. 

Its success is even more remarkable, since it targets &quot;at-risk&quot; 
youth. The average Job Corps student is 18 years old, reads at a 
seventh grade level, has never held a full-time job, and comes from 
an economically disadvantaged family. Seventy percent are minori- 



ties, 80 percent are high school dropouts, and 40 percent of their 
families receive public assistance. 

Job Corps participants receive good support, including residential 
supervision, counseling, food, clothing, education, job training, med- 
ical services, transportation, student allowances, and job place- 
ment. 

For every dollar invested in the program, $1.46 is returned to 
economy through taxes paid by graduates, reductions in welfare 
and lower costs for crime and prison. 

Because of this record. Job Corps has enjoyed bipartisan support 
in Congress and by Republican and Democratic administrations. 

Last week the Labor Committee held 3 days of hearings on re- 
forming and streamlining Federal job training programs, I share 
Senator Kassebaum&apos;s concern for ensuring that all job training pro- 
grams are accountable and cost-effective. In the wake of recent vio- 
lent incidents at Job Corps centers, it is particularly important to 
do all we can to ensure the safety of participants in the program. 

I look forward to hearing from our distinguished witnesses, and 
to working with Members on both sides of the aisle in Congress 
and with the Clinton administration to make our job training pro- 
grams as effective as possible. 

Prepared Statement of Senator Harkin 

This hearing will examine Job Corps, an education and training 
program for disadvantaged youth. We will hear from some partici- 
pants and staff about their experiences with the program. I am 
aware of some of the problems with the Job Corps program and di- 
rection on how to resolve those problems. 

A 1982 longitudinal study of the Job corps program by 
Mathmetica Policy Research estimated that each dollar spent on 
this training program returned $1.46 on the investment. The study 
is being updated^ but the new data is expected to yield the same 
or similar results. 

Job Corps is working in Iowa. In 1993, the Denison Center 
served 480 students and placed 80% in jobs or advanced training 
programs, I have visited the center on several occasions with my 
most recent visit occurring last fall to dedicate a new child care fa- 
cility. The center will now recruit and train mothers with their 
children, I would note that most of these families could most likely 
be on welfare without this addition to the Denison Center. On 
every visit I have been impressed by the program. 

I would like to include a letter from Iowa&apos;s Governor, Terry 
Branstad aflRrming his support for Job Corps and a packet of let- 
ters I received from students at the Denison Job Corps Center 
made a part of the hearing record. 

Madam Chairwoman, I know there are some problems. I am very 
concerned about the experiences of violence at certain Job Corps 
Centers that will be outlined by some of our witnesses. Even on act 
of violence at Job Corps Center is unacceptable and I want to find 
a way to make sure that the zero tolerance policy is reality for 
every participant. 

I want to find constructive solutions to these problems to build 
a more effective, residential job training pro-am for disadvantaged 
youth. I look forward to the testimony at this hearing and look for- 



ward to working with you and my other colleagues on this commit- 
tee on the major issues affecting the training and retooling of the 
American work force. 

[Letters from Governor Branstad and the Denison Job Corps 
Center may be found in the appendix.] 

The Chairman. First, we will see excerpts from a series of tele- 
vision reports by a station in Dallas, TX concerning the State of 
conditions at the McKinney Job Corps center in Dallas. 

Following the airing of these reports, the Department of Labor 
closed down the center prior to the scheduled Christmas break and 
has since, as I understand it, terminated the contract with the cen- 
ter operator. 

[Videotape shown.] 

The Chairman. I would like to welcome the first panel by saying 
how much I appreciate your willingness to come here and tell us 
about your experiences at the Job Corps. Your testimony is very 
important to us as we tiy to sort out what needs to be done to im- 
prove this program, and we look forward to hearing from vou. I 
know it is not easy, and for that reason, I think we are all very 
appreciative. 

First, I would like to welcome Rhonda Wheeler, who lives in Ven- 
tura, CA. She was a student the Job Corps center in McKinney, TX 
and was shown on the tape that was just previewed. 

Fred Freeman is from Carlisle, PA. He was a student at the 
Woodstock Job Corps Center outside Baltimore, MD. 

I would very much like to welcome both of you. Rhonda, we will 
begin with your testimony. 

STATEMENTS OF RHONDA WHEELER, VENTURA, CA, AND 
FRED FREEMAN, JR^ CARLISLE, PA 

Ms. Wheeler. My name is Rhonda Wheeler. Last year, I was a 
recently separated single mother of a 4-month-old son. I moved to 
Dallas, TX to move with my mother until I got on my feet. I had 
dropped out of high school in my second year, and I was faced with 
the fact that without an education, I would never earn enough 
money to support myself, let alone my son. 

While staying with my mother, I searched the want ads of the 
newspapers every day, finding nothing that I was qualified for. I 
had no driver&apos;s license, so that made it even harder to find work. 
That, plus the cost of day care, made my situation overwhelming. 
That is when I saw the ad for the Job Corps in McKinney. 

That ad stated: &quot;Training, room and board, transportation, child 
care and clothing allotment provided and a biweekly salary.&quot; It 
sounded wonderUil. It sounded too good to be true — and as it 
turned out, it was. 

During orientation the first day, we were given a briefing by se- 
curity, which was very strange. They told us the names and ad- 
dresses of drug dealers in McKinney, and they told us not to go 
there. They warned the women in my orientation group about 
places we should avoid on center because of the recent rapes that 
had occurred. They also told us the best hiding places on center 
where kids go to have sex, which included under the buildings and 
in the bushes. 



During the 10 days I was at McKinney, I saw kids having sex 
all the time, and often right out in the open. When I mentioned one 
incident to one of my counselors during my second or third day on 
center, I was told, &quot;Welcome to Job Corps. You might as well get 
used to it.&quot; 

From my second day on, whenever I walked anywhere alone on 
center, or passed a large group of females, they would start shout- 
ing, &quot;Bitch&quot; or other obscenities. When I mentioned this to one of 
the security people, he said, &quot;We have got bigger problems than 
name-calling to worry about,&quot; and that I should get over it. 

On my third day there, I was harassed by a student to the point 
that she had to be held back from assaulting me. The student then 
threatened to &quot;get me when I was asleep.&quot; I went to security and 
filed a complaint against her. The counselor talked to me and said 
the student said she had not meant anything by what she said, 
that it was just a misunderstanding and that I should put it behind 
me. 

As for the violence on center, I saw 12 fights in the 10 days I 
was there. During orientation, we were able to tour our various 
classes on center, I went to the clerical class because that was one 
of my choices. Five minutes after I got there, two students started 
punching each other. Both were bleeding, and one student picked 
up a typewriter and threw it at the other. The teacher acted like 
this happened quite frequently. He sent both students to security. 
I never found out if they were punished, but both students were 
back in class the next day. 

Illegal drugs were rampant at McKinney. I was approached fre- 
quently and asked if I wanted to buy anything from marijuana to 
acid, and nobody tried to hide it. It was another one of those things 
at the Job Corps that was part of the atmosphere of the place. 

For example, everyone knew the drug dealers would come to the 
east side of the campus and sell it openly to students through the 
fence. 

And security rarely did anything about it, probably because they 
were scared of the students. On one occasion after dark, I saw a 
security vehicle patrolling the bushes near the center administra- 
tion building. I was sitting on the steps. I saw about 10 students 
coming out of the bushes, yelling, &quot;Get that spotlight off my 
woman,&quot; and shouting all kinds of four-letter words at the security 
patrol. The students surrounded the vehicle in a threatening way, 
and I thought they were going to beat up the two security guards 
in the vehicle, but one student recognized one of the guards and 
said, &quot;OK, he&apos;s cool,&quot; and the security just drove away. 

By my 10th day at McKinney, I could not wait to go home. It was 
a madhouse. I wanted out. I called my mother and asked her to 
come and get me. Some of the managers from the Job Corps center 
called me at my mother&apos;s house, trying to get me to reconsider. 
They came over first thing in the morning. But there was no way 
that I was going back there. 

I would like to say one last thing in closing. I am aware that 
Wackenhut, the center operator of McKinney, has sent information 
regarding me to members of this committee. I have read the infor- 
mation that was sent, and I would like all of the members of this 



committee to know that the information sent by Wackenhut is ab- 
solutely untrue and is a malicious attack on my character. 

The other information regarding my health histoiy is distorted 
and untrue, but even if it were true, it is a clear violation of my 
right to privacy that I was promised when I joined the Job Corps. 

1 want the committee to know that I am contacting an attorney 
to discuss taking legal action against Wackenhut for sending this 
information to the committee. 

Thank you, and I will be happy to answer any questions. 

The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Wheeler. 

Mr. Freeman? 

Mr. Freeman. Grood morning. Madam Chairman. 

Chairman Kassebaum and members of the committee, my name 
is Fred Freeman, Jr. I am 19 years old, and I am from Carlisle, 
PA. I attended Woodstock Job Corps Center outside Baltimore, MD 
in March of 1992. I lasted for about 23 days before I became con- 
vinced that the program was not for me. I left voluntarily; I was 
not terminated. 

The reason why I left was simple: I was tired of getting beat up 
and being threatened by other students and having the center ig- 
nore what was happening. 

The Job Corps program that the recruiter told me about was very 
different from the one I experienced at the Woodstock Center. The 
reason I went there was to learn a skill that would help me get 
a good job and to get my GED. I was a high school dropout. My 
Job Corps recruiter. Bob Settle, said so many nice things about the 
program. He showed me a listing and beautiful color pictures of 
various Job Corps centers. Judging from the pictures, they all 
looked like expensive summer camps and resorts. 

But when I arrived at Woodstock in early March of 1992, the dif- 
ference between what Mr. Settle had said the program would be 
like and the reality was shocking. 

The condition of the buildings and the residential living areas 
was rundown. Many of the dormitory rooms had cracks in the ceil- 
ings, and there was no way to secure your possessions. But the big- 
gest downer of all was the violations and the threats of violence 
from other students that occurred on a daily basis. 

The first night I got there, one of the other new students got into 
a fight with another student who had been there for a while. The 
new guy got beat up and knocked down, but no one told the resi- 
dential advisor. I was told that this was part of the landscape, and 
I should get used to it. 

The second night, I got mv &quot;blanket party.&quot; This was standard 
treatment for all new guys. A blanket party, for those not familiar 
with the term, is when you are sleeping in your bunk, somebody 
suddenly throws a blanket over you, and eight to ten guys take 
turns punching you and kicking you. The blanket is so that you 
cannot identify who is doing the punching and kicking. After it 
happened, I told the residential advisor. He said he would make a 
report on it, but nothing ever happened. That was part for the 
course at Woodstock. 

There were fights regularly, aft«r-hours in the dorm area, but no 
one was ever put on report for it. Many of the students carried 
knives and other homemade weapons that they made in the metal 



8 

shop. I even saw two students who had pistols in their rooms. It 
was pretty scary. As for drug use people were always smoking 
dope. The residential advisors knew about it, but nobody did any- 
thing about it. 

One might, a guy came up to me in the hall of my dormitory and 
asked me if I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I said sure. He told 
me to come into his room, which I did. Once inside the room, he 
closed the door and forced me up against a wall, holding a fork to 
my throat. He told me to give him all the money I had or else. I 
had $10 in my pocket, and I gave it to him. 

I mentioned to my roommate what happened, and he said, &quot;Go 
ahead and report it, but you had better be ready for that guy to 
come after you.&quot; I never did report it, for fear that the guy would 
come after me. 

There was a lot of gang activity in the center, too. Gangs wore 
their colors, gave their gang signs and travelled in packs. If you 
messed with one of them, you had every other guy in his gang com- 
ing after you. 

Theft was another problem. When I went to Woodstock, I took 
two big suitcases of clothing, including a pair of Air Jordans. With- 
in the first 2 weeks, most of my clothes were stolen right out of 
my room. A few days before I left, a guy came into my room with 
a few others. I looked at his feet, and I realized he was wearing 
my stolen Air Jordans. 

I said, &quot;Hey, you got my Air Jordans; I want them back.&quot; He did 
not deny it, but he told me if I wanted them, I would have to fight 
him for them. I said, &quot;All right, let&apos;s go.&quot; 

Suddenly, someone turned out the lights in the room, and I was 
kicked and punched by him and his buddies. About 20 guys jumped 
me, and I got kicked from head to toe. After they left, my room- 
mate took me down to the duty officer, and they took me to Balti- 
more County Hospital. I had two cracked ribs, and my right temple 
was swollen up like a balloon. 

I never got my Air Jordans back, and to my knowledge, no one 
was disciplined for the incident — ^no center review board, no noth- 
ing. 

I left the center 2 days later to go home on emergency leave be- 
cause my sister was sick. When my parents saw the bruises on me 
and my swollen face, plus my cracked ribs, they did not want me 
to go back. I did not want to go back, either. I wanted to get my 
GED and learn a trade, but not under those conditions. 

A couple days later, my father drove me back to Woodstock to get 
my stuff, and I voluntarily left the program. When I got there to 
pick up my stuff, my dormitory had been torched. Luckily, my room 
did not get burned. There were a couple of other kids firom Carlisle 
who were also quitting at the same time. One of them had cigarette 
burns up and down his arms as a result of an incident in the dor- 
mitory. He said he had had it with all the abuse. 

When I left, I signed a form stating that I had had clothing, 
shoes and personal items stolen from me worth between $400 to 
$500. They said they would reimburse me. That was 2V2 years ago. 
I have made several calls to the regional office in Philadelphia 
about it, but nothing was ever done about it. They still owe me for 
the stolen items. 



In closing, I would like to say that Job Corps seemed like a good 
idea when I first heard about it. It was supposed to be a pro-am 
that helped you get your high school diploma and gave you training 
in a trade that would help you get a good iob. 

The reality is that Job Corps is more like a reform school or a 
place that the court sends you instead of jail, where the strong 
dominate the weak. I think it is a waste of taxpayers&apos; money. If I 
were a parent, I would not allow my kids to go there. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. 

I have just a couple of questions. First, Rhonda, I would just like 
to say that I share your concern about the memo that was sent out 
by the Wackenhut Educational Services. It is an invasion of pri- 
vacy — it was sent to every member of the committee — not only re- 
garding yourself, but others who were in the television series about 
McKinney. 

I know that in the past, this has been something that, when we 
have asked for records, there is always the question of wanting to 
protect privacy, and no records have been available. So I think that 
this is unfortunate. We have had situations regarding these hear- 
ings which create an atmosphere of intimidation which I really 
think is uncalled for. 

We have tried very hard to not make this in any way a sensa- 
tional atmosphere regarding these hearings. There would have 
been far more that we could use that would have been very sensa- 
tional if indeed that were the intent. But the intent is to try to fig- 
ure out what we can do to make Job Corps a stronger £ind better 
program. 

Both of you have really shown a great deal of courage to come 
here, because I know it has been difficult. I would iust like to ask 
you, Fttionda, while you were at the center, it is obvious that the 
violence there had a great effect on you and I assume on many oth- 
ers there. Did you find that for the brief time that you were there 
that there was an effort to have a strong training program? 

Ms. Wheeler. No. The first 10 days is orientation, and the only 
training that I saw there — I toured the clerical class, and the only 
thing I saw was them throwing typewriters at each other. But dur- 
ing the 10 days that I was there, we were really just briefed by se- 
curity. We played video games a lot is what we did. 

The Chairman. From your experience in talking to the other stu- 
dents who were there, did you get a feel for whether students were 
there with an intent to try to learn some skill? Was the focus on 
job training skills, or were there students there who were referrals 
from the courts? 

Ms. Wheeler. Yes. A lot of the kids just did not have any other 
place to go, and that is the truth. A lot of them had warrants, but 
most of them iust did not have anyplace to go. 

I had a real close friend who wanted to leave Job Corps because 
in 10 days, 10 of his friends had gotten beaten up real, real bad, 
and he knew he was next. So I went and picked him up from Job 
Corps; he left, and we took him to his parents&apos; and his parents told 
him that he would have to live out on the street — ^he was 19 — that 
he would have to live out on the street before he would come home 
from Job Corps, and they made him go back. Three days later, he 



10 

was viciously attacked, viciously attacked. And he had to stay; he 
is still there. He just had no place to go. 

The idea of studying — it is not an atmosphere that you can really 
study in. And I am sure that at first, a lot of kids have the inten- 
tion of coming to get the training they need, but then all the dis- 
tractions that come in are so overwhelming that you lose that in- 
tent. 

The Chairman. Fred, when you were at Woodstock, did anyone 
mention to you — and perhaps this would be true at McKinney as 
well — that there is a zero tolerance requirement for violence at the 
center, that this is the policy of the Job Corps program, trying to 
reinforce zero tolerance of violence? 

Mr. FREEMAN. Some members of the security guard and some 
residential advisors did, but they did not go by what they said. 
What they said to me was one thing, and then when some violence 
happened, they did another thing; basically, they ignored it. 

The Chairman. Did you find a similar situation at Woodstock as 
you heard Rhonda Wheeler describe at McKinney? 

Mr. Freeman. Yes. 

The Chairman. And as you have talked to fiiends since you have 
been out, did you feel that you gained anything while you were 
there that has been of use to you since? 

Mr. Freeman. No, nothing that I can remember right now that 
I can use. 

The Chairman. If either one of you had to give some suggestions 
for what should be done first to improve the program, do either of 
you have a suggestion you would make? Rhonda? 

Ms. Wheeler. I would say you would have to first decide wheth- 
er you want Job Corps to be like a prison camp or you want it to 
be a school. If you want a place like Job Corps to be a school, you 
would have to weed out all the people with warrants, all the gangs; 
you would have to weed out the drugs. You would have to do that. 
You would have to decide whether you wanted it to be a prison 
camp, because if you are going to keep the same kids there, you 
are going to have to run it like that; you would have to run it like 
a prison camp in order for them to learn anything, because it is 
just that violent. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

My time is up. Senator Pell? 

Senator Pell. Obviously, these incidents that you have spoken 
about, your experiences, are pretty dreadful. How widespread do 
you think those incidents are, from the gossip amongst the kids 
who were in your camp, in other camps around the country? Maybe 
yours were rogue camps. What are your thoughts? 

Mr. Freeman. Well, I just recently spoke to a girl who went to 
the Utah Job Corps. While she was tnere, she had her nose broken, 
she was stabbed with a pencil. A lot of people at the Job Corps in 
Utah were sent to I guess different psychiatric hospitals, from what 
she told me, because it is just so violent. I believe that it is wide- 
spread. 

Senator Pell. Do you have any thoughts, Mr. Freeman? 

Mr. Freeman. I recently spoke to one of my friends who attended 
the same Job Corps I did, but she attended the year before. While 
she was there, she was severely beaten. She got stabbed; she has 



11 

scars on her body from a bunch of gangs and stuff like that down 
there. 

To me, from what I went through, when I was in Woodstock, 
MD, everyone who was there who had been to other Job Corps, Hke 
in Pittsburgh and stuff Hke that, said that it is basically the same 
thing with all the other Job Corps. 

Senator Pell. Thank you both very much and for your courage 
in coming forward this way. 

I have no further questions. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

Let me first thank both of you for testifying this morning. You 
describe in your separate testimonies about the separate facilities, 
Ms. Wheeler, a case where you saw open sex, open use of drugs, 
fights; and Mr. Freeman, you were personally assaulted, personally 
robbed, and you saw drugs. You have both described a situation 
that, to put it charitably, is certainly not conducive to any kind of 
learning or study. 

Let me ask both of you who really was in charge in your separate 
facilities. Who ran the place, really? 

Ms. Wheeler. The kids; the students ran my Job Corps. I do not 
know legally who ran it besides Wackenhut, but the students ran 
the Job Corps, the gangs. 

Senator DeWine. And there were gangs there? 

Ms. Wheeler. Oh, yes, definitely, definitely. 

Senator DeWine. Mr. Freeman? 

Mr. Freeman. Basically, the students, the gangs ran it. I am 
sure there was somebody who was supposed to be running it and 
taking care of weeding out all of the violence and problems like 
that, but basically, the kids ruled the school. 

Senator DeWente. You described it as an environment where the 
strong dominated the weak, basically. 

Mr. Freeman. Yes. 

Senator DeWine. So it was basically the subculture inside the 
operation that was controlling it. 

Mr. Freeman. Right. 

Senator DeWine. You both described the situation, and both of 
you lefl after a short period of time, one of you afler 10 days, and 
Mr. Freeman, I believe, afler 23 days. If that was your reaction, 
what was the reaction of some of the other students? You have said 
that some of them had no place else to go, but certainly there were 
some there who could have been other places. I mean, did anybody 
else complain to you? Did you find anybody else who had a com- 
mon 

Ms. Wheeler. Oh, yes — everybody, everybody. I was always told, 
&quot;If you fight one, you fight them all.&quot; Mainlv during the day, the 
kids who did not want to have anything to do with the drugs and 
the gangs would go in their rooms and sit afler school. They did 
not walk outside, they did not go to dinner unless it was a school 
day and they had to. They would sit in there rooms. There would 
always be somebody afler you, always. 

I literally slept with one eye open. I was literally told not even 
to leave a pair of panties out because they would get it. So yes, ev- 



12 

eryone there had some sort of problem or another — I mean every- 
one. 

Senator DeWene. So there clearly were people there, though, who 
were like you, who did want to learn, who went there for a specific 
purpose? 

Ms. Wheeler. Oh, yes, yes. 

Senator DeWine. What learning did you observe? I know you 
were there for a relatively short period of time, and Mr. Freeman, 
you were there for 3 weeks or so, but in each of your cases, was 
there learning going on, was there teaching going on, was there 
training going on that you observed? 

Mr. Fmjeman. Well, I went there wanting to get my GED and 
further my education, and second, I wanted to taJte culinary arts. 
In the period of time that I was there, they bounced me back and 
forth, so that basically I did not get a chance to learn the trade I 
wanted to. I learned a little bit of it, but they bounced me back and 
forth between landscaping, brick masonry, welding, culinary arts, 
and their other training. 

And for the schooling, the stuff they taught I already knew. 
When I would tell the person who was teaching the class, &quot;I al- 
ready went through this, I already know about this; can I take a 
test and go on and advance to another level?&quot; she would say, &quot;No. 
You are going to stay right here at this level with the whole class.&quot; 

Senator DeWeste. For some students, though, Mr. Freeman, 
would you say that the teaching was appropriate? What I am try- 
ing to get at is — ^you have described the culture of violence here 
which is not conducive to learning — ^but we are trying to get a full 
picture as well. For some of the students, was the teaching appro- 
priate, that you could see? 

Mr. Freeman. Yes. 

Senator DeWine. So there was some learning going on there. 

Mr. Freeman. Yes. 

Senator DeWine. Ms. Wheeler? 

Ms. Wheeler. Well, I was there for 10 days, and that was ori- 
entation, and I just never observed any teaching going on. When 
I toured the classes, I toured about five classes, but I never actu- 
ally saw anyone teaching anyone anything. I mean, the printing 
class that I toured, there were no students in the class, and the 
teacher was just sitting there, doing nothing. And the clerical class 
that I went into, they were throwing typewriters and fighting. 

Senator DeWine. Literally, throwing typewriters? 

Ms. Wheeler. Literally, throwing typewriters. That was the 
class I was going to choose as my clerical class, and I walked in 
there, and there were people bleeding — it was bad. 

And then I toured tne electricians class, and that was insane; I 
mean literally, it was insane. The teacher went back into the office 
and took the three kids, myself and two others who were touring 
the electrical class, took us back there and locked the door. They 
were beating on the door, pounding, just pounding, and they were 
not doing anything — ^they were not doing anything, nothing. It was 
insane. 

Senator DeWine. Thank you very much. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

Senator Kassebaum. Thank you. Senator DeWine. 



13 

Senator Dodd? 

Senator Dodd. First I would like to thank you, Madam Chair- 
man, for holding these hearings, and let me also thank our wit- 
nesses for coming today. 

As someone vmo has chaired a lot of hearings over the years 
where young people are asked to come and testify, I know it is al- 
ways a difficult thing to do, and we certainly appreciate your pres- 
ence here today. 

Madam Chairman, I really do not have any questions for our wit- 
nesses, but I would like to make a couple of comments if I could. 
First of all, I would like to introduce in the record a letter we re- 
ceived from George Foreman who is, as you know, a graduate of 
a Job Corps center and feels very, very strongly about the Job 
Corps experience and what it meant in his life. 

To quote from his letter, he says, &quot;I want to be known as in Job 
Corps&apos; comer as it was once in mine. Since 1968, when I went to 
the Parks Job Corps Center in California to Mexico City, where I 
won the Olympic Gold Medal, I have gone on record before all 
kinds of audiences and in one congressional hearing about what a 
youthful direction-changer it was for me. It was more than a skill 
training experience. It showed me there were well-intentioned and 
caring people, from the biggest American corporations to dedicated 
individuals who were helpml, if there was a matching effort and 
response from us youthful disadvantaged in quest of opportunities. 
They provided first steps from the swamp we were in, and that 
there was a way out and up in lives for which no hope was appar- 
ent before.&quot; 

&quot;Job Corps has known both praise and criticism, winners and los- 
ers. As one who was in it, knew it from the inside and the hope- 
lessness of those to whom it reached out, I have always felt it at- 
tacked a problem likely to be with us always, and until something 
comes up that is a better way, it should be retained. To me, it was 
indeed a friend in need. It is a sad moment in one&apos;s life when he 
denies his roots or where he comes from, but I acknowledge that 
whatever I have been and am today, the Job Corps was my start- 
ing point. Treat it kindly.&quot; 

Signed, George Foreman. 

I will put that in the record. 

[Letter from George Foreman may be found in the appendix.] 

Senator Dodd. Madam Chairman, I just want to make a couple 
of points. As I understand it, there are roughly about 100 of these 
centers around the country, and I do not know how many people 
are presently in the program. We have had testimony now from our 
two lead-off witnesses totalling about 20 or 30 days of an experi- 
ence there — and a dreadful and tragic one. 

I would hope as we go through this process — and vou stated so 
in your opening comments — ^there are, obviously, the dreadful anec- 
dotal stories that can doom a program, and the only thing people 
may know about this will be the testimony of a few witnesses who 
have had a terrible experience. As I understand it, the McKinney 
Center is now closed. It was shut down. You made that point ear- 
lier, and I think that is worth noting. I do not know all the reasons 
why it was shut down, but I suspect in part it was because of the 
experiences that Ms. Wheeler has had, perhaps among others. 



14 

But I think it is important to note, as we look at the kinds of 
people we are trying to deal with in our Job Corps programs after 
3 decades, and some tremendous successes, that these are the 
toughest, toughest situations that these young people are living in 
in our country, age 16 to 24. They come from our roughest neigh- 
borhoods and communities, under the most difficult circumstances. 
All Job Corps students are economically disadvantaged. That is a 
criterion for getting in. Approximately 40 percent are 16- to 17- 
year-olds; 70 percent are members of minority groups; 50 percent 
black, 14 percent Hispanic, 6 percent other minorities; 40 percent 
are women; 80 percent are high school dropouts; 70 percent have 
never held full-time jobs; 43 percent are from families on public as- 
sistance. More than 4 out of 10 entering students read below the 
4th grade level. That is 16- to 24-year olds. 

I would point out that of those who complete the program — one- 
third drop out in the first 90 days for a lot of reasons — but of those 
who complete the program, 60 percent end up going on to higher 
education and jobs and completing their high school equivalency. 
So that as we look at this — and clearly, things need to be done to 
improve security and performance — I hope we do not, as I am fear- 
ful will happen here, destroy something that has meant a great 
deal to an awful lot of people and can work better and work well. 
And I did not hear either one of our witnesses say that if they were 
sitting on this side of the table, they would vote to eliminate Job 
Corps altogether across the country. They had bad experiences and 
got out of the program. 

Madam Chairman, I served in the Peace Corps in the 1960&apos;s 
when the Job Corps and a lot of these programs came up. Peace 
Corps volunteers came from by and large suburban, upper-income, 
middle-class communities, and we went to work in Third World 
countries. In a sense. Job Corps is just the reverse of that. What 
we are looking at is a lot of children coming from neighborhoods 
and communities that mirror the Third World countries that many 
of us went to work in. 

So I sincerely hope as we go through these 2 days of hearings 
on this issue that we will not lose sight of the important value this 
program has and will have. 

We have all been victimized and seen in the past these programs 
of an investigative report, and the eye of a little camera moving 
around — ^it was hard to see in that program, and it was kind of a 
sensational approach to it — and it can end up destroying something 
that is just terribly important. 

It costs somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 a year to keep 
a person in jail in Connecticut. It costs about $60,000 a year to 
keep a young person in a residential treatment program. This is an 
expensive program, and I hope we can reduce the cost, but we have 
to start to work with these young people who are the toughest to 
place. 

And again, maybe there are better alternatives. As George Fore- 
man said, maybe someone will come up with a better idea, and if 
thev do, then let us consider it. But in the meantime, let us try to 
make this program work. Let us get it on track. Let us come up 
with some good ideas and suggestions on how to improve it. 



15 

So I am sure that of the thousands of people who have gone 
through these programs and have completed the programs, some 
have had tough experiences in them. It sounds in some ways not 
unlike an urban high school in my State when I hear what is going 
on from our two witnesses here, or college campuses in some ways. 
Now, that is not an excuse, but nonetheless this is an endemic 
problem we are facing today in our society. It is not, unfortunately, 
focused just on Job Corps centers. Today, you can go into what 
once were nice, polite, safe neighborhoods, and there is violence ev- 
erywhere. That is an endemic problem we have got to try to do 
something about, and I think this is a reflection of what is happen- 
ing in some of these places. 

So again I thank our witnesses for being here this morning and 
look forward to the testimony of the coming panels. And again, I 
sincerely hope we will really focus on how we can make this work 
better. 

Thank you, Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. I thank you. Senator Dodd. I would just say, as 
I said at the beginning and have said before, that the intent is to 
make the program work better. When George Foreman was in the 
program in 1969, it was a relatively new program with high ideals. 
I think it is a real disservice to the young people who are in the 
program today to not make sure that those same ideals and criteria 
are maintained. 

The inspector general at the Department of Labor since 1987 has 
been raising concerns about the program that we here in Congress 
have passed over and others have passed over, and that is why I 
feel that sometimes it takes witnesses who bring the worst to light 
in order to get our attention. Nobody was paying any attention to 
the inspector general&apos;s report at the Department of Labor, and I 
think in order to make sure that we are doing what we should do, 
we have to view it in the context of trying to find some answers 
to make it work better. 

I value what you said, but I also want you to know that that is 
the intent of these hearings. 

Senator Dodd, I appreciate that. And you are right, when Greorge 
Foreman was in the program in 1968, tne United States was a lot 
different then as a country, too. 

The Chairman. Senator Harkin? 

Senator Harkin. Thank you. Madam Chair. 

Again, I appreciate the witnesses coming this morning, and I 
want to echo what the chairman of the committee said when she 
said we want to make the Job Corps centers work better and find 
out if there is anything we can do to help make them work better 
and more effectively, more efficiently. I am all for that. So I appre- 
ciate your coming this morning to tell your stories. 

As I xmderstand, there are 111 centers in the United States. Ms. 
Wheeler, you spent 10 days at McKinney. Have you ever been to 
another Job Corps center? 

Ms. Wheeler. No, I have not. 

Senator Harkin. And Mr. Freeman, you spent 23 days at Wood- 
stock. Have you ever been to another Job Corps center? 

Mr. Freeman. No. 



16 

Senator Harkin. Well, I guess I would just echo what Senator 
Dodd was saying. We have 111 centers, and they serve really some 
of the toughest populations in the United States. These are some 
pretty tough kids. And quite frankly, I am surprised there are not 
more stories like this when you tnink of the population that is 
being served and some of the environments that some of these 
young people come out of. I am surprised there are not more. 

But I think, quite frankly, that the vast majority of Job Corps 
centers are doing an outstanding job in the United States. 

We have one in Iowa, the Denison Job Corps Center. I have vis- 
ited there many times, and I have never heard stories like this. I 
am not saying that it has not happened; I would not have first- 
hand knowledge of it. But the private businesses in the community 
of Denison think it is probably one of the best things that ever hap- 
pened to Denison, lA. And these are the Main Street business peo- 
ple there. It has support from that community. 

At first, when it moved in there, people were a little leery of it. 
And Denison is a small community of maybe a few thousand peo- 
ple, but I am telling you that the members of the private sector 
there are the biggest supporters of the Job Corps center. And these 
are kids who come fi&apos;om all over the State, out of State. Again, 
these are some pretty tough kids who come in there. 

We just added a facility onto that Job Corps center where moth- 
ers like you, Rhonda, who have young children — now, you probably 
were not able to take your child to the Job Corps center, were 
you 

Ms. Wheeler. No. 

Senator Harkin. At the Denison Job Corps Center in Iowa, a 
young woman like you with a young child can be there with her 
young child. There is a day care center there, there is a Head Start 
center there, so that you can go to classes, and your child has great 
day care, preschool, nutrition programs. They are all right there in 
the Job Corps center. 

There are not many like that in the United States. This was one 
of the first centers that got such a system. But it tends to make 
it a more family-oriented type of experience, rather than just single 
people nmning around there; it makes it more family-oriented. And 
with the Head Start center there, I thought, gee, we ought to have 
more of those around the country, where we combine the young 
people with their children, and a Head Start center right in the Job 
Corps center itself I think it tends to take some of the hard edge 
off of people. 

So there are innovative things that we can do, I think, to change 
the Job Corps centers to be able to reach out to people like you and 
to make your experiences there a little bit more pleasant. And I 
think if you could have had your child at a center like this, your 
story here today would have been completely different, if you could 
have been at Denison. 

Ms. Wheeler. No, I do not think it would have. I am sornr. 

Senator Harkes[. If you had been at Denison and could have 
taken your child to the Denison Job Corps Center in Iowa and got- 
ten training, you say your story would not have been any different 
today? 



17 

Ms. Wheeler. No, no, that is not what I am saying. I am saying 
that if I would have had my child with me 

Senator Harkin. No. I said if you could have had an experience 
at the Denison Job Corps Center in Denison, lA, where you could 
have taken your child and lived with your child, and your child 
could have gotlO day care training, and you could have gone to 
classes and so on, and where there was no violence, I think your 
story would have been different today. 

^ls. Wheeler. It might be, it may nave been, yes. 

Senator Harkin. That is what I am saying. So I guess this Job 
Corps center has been shut down. I am not going to defend every 
Job Corps center and every manager that runs one, but you cannot 
paint all the Job Corps centers with a broad brush. 

You have probably never been on a college campus, either, have 
you? 

Ms. Wheeler. No. 

Senator Harkin. Have you ever been on a college campus, Mr. 
Freeman? 

Mr. Freeman. No. 

Senator Harkin. Well, I am telling you, there is a lot of sex and 
a lot of drugs going on on college campuses, whether it is Ohio 
State or the University of Kansas or Connecticut or Iowa. 

Senator DoDD. Be careful, now. We are number one in basket- 
ball. [Laughter.] 

Senator Harkin. But I am saying you cannot paint all of these 
things with a broad brush stroke. 

Madam Chair, I would like to submit for the record a letter from 
the Reverend Wayne Hoehns, Des Moines, lA, in support of the Job 
Corps center. He is a volunteer who works with Job Corps people 
when they complete Job Corps and go on to get jobs. 

He says, &quot;I am proud to be one of the thousands of volunteers 
all across America who are able to help many Job Corps completers 
make successful transitions into our Nation&apos;s work force.&quot; 

&quot;I have observed that the finest training programs at Job Corps 
centers are those which are in partnership with free enterprise cor- 
porations. My conclusion is that we need to encourage more of this 
kind of cooperative opportunity.&quot; 

[Letter from Reverend Hoehns may be found in the appendix.] 

Senator Harkin. Last summer was the 30th anniversary of Job 
Corps. I was honored to be at one and to be honored for my support 
for Job Corps at that time. I was not the only one — Senator Simon, 
Congressman Williams, Congressman Hoyer, and Senator Dole 
from Kansas were also honored. 

I would like to include in the record a letter from Senator Robert 
Dole, the now Majority Leader of the Senate, and I will just read 
a couple paragrapns. 

He says, &quot;Well, first let me thank Rick Littinberger for an earlier 
presentation of the award. I am very honored to receive the award. 
We have a great Job Corps center in Manhattan, KA — Flint Hills 
Job Corps Center. I was there for the dedication. I was there trying 
to get it built. We had a lot of help from Republicans, Democrats, 
and people in the area.&quot; 

&quot;It has been a great success story, as other Job Corps centers 
have been across the coimtry. It gives young people opportunities 



18 

they never dreamed of and makes them successful workers. They 
get back in the work force, do good things and are on the tax rolls 
and payrolls all across America. And I mink this is one program, 
Mr, Secretary, we ought to take a look at when we talk about ex- 
pansion.&quot; 

&quot;I used to know the Secretary of Labor pretty well; I think her 
name was Elizabeth Dole. And I talked about the Job Corps pro- 
gram to her, and she was a very strong supporter of the Job Corps 
program.&quot; 

&quot;I am sorry I cannot be here for the main program, but I thank 
you very much for this outstanding award. It will be displayed 
proudly in my office.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Signed, Senator Robert Dole. 

Senator Harkin. So again, I do not doubt what you say at all. 
I do not doubt that these incidents happened. To the extent that 
thev do, we need to tighten down on them, and any suggestions 
and advice that we can get on how we perhaps restructureTnow we 
take care of these kinds of things, I am all for. We cannot let one 
or two bad apples spoil the barrel. 

Quite frankly, I think the vast majority of Job Corps centers in 
the United States are doing a great job. So I think your testimony 
here this morning will encourage us to take a look at how we might 
revise, how we might streamline, how we might make them more 
effective and able to do a better job. 

And as I said, rather than holding up McKinney or Woodstock 
as prime examples of Job Corps, Madam Chair, I would like to hold 
up the Denison, LA Job Corps Center as the prime example of what 
Job Corps can do. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Harkin. 

I would just like to point out, though, that McKinnev is not an 
isolated incident. The Department of Labor itself has identified 25 
centers as being ones with potential problems relating to the condi- 
tions at the centers. 

As I said earlier, we tried hard not to have a whole array of wit- 
nesses here wanting to tell stories, because it is difficult not to re- 
gard everybody tarred with the same brush, and that is not the in- 
tent. But I would suggest to you that just because someone is eco- 
nomically disadvantaged, we should not tolerate the levels of vio- 
lence that are being tolerated. That is very unfair to those who are 
wanting to seek job training and assistance at these centers. And 
that was the purpose of this hearing. 

Senator JL^kin. Madam Chair, I could not agree more with you 
on that. You are right on point on that. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

I thank Ms. Wheeler and Mr. Freeman very much. We appreciate 
your testimony today. 

It is a pleasure to welcome our second panel. I would like to in- 
troduce Grerald Peterson, the former assistant inspector general for 
audit at the Department of Labor. Randall Godinet is a former resi- 
dential advisor at the Flint Hills Job Corps Center in Manhattan, 
KA. He now works with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America in 
San Diego. CA. Shirley Sakos was a licensed practical nurse at the 
Edison Job Corps Center in Edison, NJ from 1992 to 1994. Ser- 



19 

geant Ron Stall worth has been a law enforcement officer for 20 
years. He is a gang intelligence coordinator with the State of Utah 
Department of Public Safety, Division of Investigation. 

It is a great pleasure to welcome you. Let me first say that your 
full statements will be made a part of the record, and if you could 
hold your statements to around 5 minutes, it would be appreciated. 
Thank you. 

Mr. Peterson, we will begin with you. 

STATEMENTS OF GERALD W. PETERSON, FORMER ASSISTANT 
INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, WASH- 
INGTON, DC; RANDALL GODINET, OCEANSIDE, CA; SHIRLEY 
D. SAKOS, PISCATAWAY, NJ; AND RON STALLWORTH, DE- 
PARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, SALT LAKE CITY, UT 

Mr. Peterson. Thank you, Senator Kassebaum and members of 
the committee. 

As you have already mentioned, Job Corps is a very expensive 
program. It costs taxpayers over $1 billion per year, and this trans- 
lates to about $23,000 per year per participant. 

Let me say at the outset that I am one of those people who be- 
lieves very much that the Government needs to support a progn&apos;am 
similar to Job Corps. I also very much believe that the progfram 
should be improved £md can be improved and made more effective 
in helping participants to become more employable, responsible and 
productive citizens. 

In our reports, we have reported that over $100 million is wasted 
annually; that is to say, there is no measurable gain for 15 percent 
of total Job Corps funds. Only about 12 or 13 percent of the partici- 
pants obtain jobs for which they were trained. That is the job 
match category. Most of the information I am revealing today. Sen- 
ator, is for program year ending 1990, which was the last year that 
the inspector general audited the statistics for the Department of 
Labor. 

A full one-fourth of total Job Corps participants are lost in the 
system, and I think this is very disturbing. Job Corps simply does 
not know what happened to them. What we have said is that know- 
ing what happens to students after leaving Job Corps is essential 
before any evaluation of program effectiveness is possible. 

One out of five of total Job Corps participants are not placed in 
any jobs or returned to school or enter the armed forces. 

Only 17 percent of total Job Corps funds actually go toward the 
educational/vocational training piece. As you know, the residential 
part of the program is a very expensive part of the program. 

Classroom aosenteeism averages 33 percent in some centers and 
as high as 50 percent in other centers. I believe the inspector gen- 
eral, later on in the year, will have a more detailed report on mis, 
but before I retired, we had developed a pilot which suggested a 
very high rate of absenteeism at the centers that we visited. 

The poor-performing centers consistently rank at the bottom, yet 
they continue to be fmly funded despite the fact that they show lit- 
tle or no improvement. 

Also disturbing, I think, is that by Job Corps&apos; own count, there 
are approximately $400 million in unfunded renovations necessary 



20 

to make the current Job Corps centers a more desirable environ- 
ment, more conducive to learning and intensive trsiining. 

I think what is really troublesome about that is that at the time 
when Job Corps had $400 million of unfunded renovations on their 
books, they were trying to at the same time expand the program 
considerably. 

I believe that the program operations and performance need to 
be carefully evaluated and corrective actions taken if the American 
taxpayers are going to continue to support a program like Job 
Corps. 

I think more important than the statistics is ensuring that you 
have a management that is intent on doing something about these 
statistics. Most troublesome to me was that shortly after we briefed 
you. Senator Kassebaum, the Secretary of Labor characterized the 
data that we used in that briefing as isolated facts and misinter- 
pretations of isolated facts. I think that is not the way to go about 
evaluating this program and getting it fixed. 

More troublesome than that, the current Job Corps director told 
me that I was wasting his time when we conducted an exit con- 
ference using this data and refused to even appear at future exist 
conferences because he felt that this data was, I guess, not nec- 
essary for his management of the Job Corps centers. I think that 
type of approach to management of Job Corps assures you are 
going to get into problems, have serious problems, and that you are 
not going to solve them. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Peterson. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Peterson may be found in the ap- 
pendix.] 

The Chairman. Mr. Godinet? 

Mr. Godinet. Good morning, Chairman Kassebaum and mem- 
bers of the committee. 

My name is Randall Godinet. I reside in Ocean side, CA, where 

1 work as the executive director for the Ocean side Boys and Girls 
Club. I have been involved in Boys and Girls Clubs since the early 
1970&apos;s. 

In January of 1992, I left my job with the Boys and Girls Club 
to take a position as a residential advisor at the newly opened Flint 
Hills Job Corps Center in Manhattan, KA. I was later promoted to 
senior residential advisor. It was a position I occupied for the next 

2 years, in which I received and completed a certified reviewer&apos;s 
training, phase one, in Reno, NV. 

I along with other staff was involved in the start-up of this Job 
Corps center in Manhattan, managed by the Management Training 
Corporation. I came to this position with high hopes that I would 
be able to use my experience and education to improve the future 
prospects of at-risk youth who look up to Job Corps as a real alter- 
native to the dead ends to which their untrained lives are leading. 

But my experience with this MTC facility showed me a cynical 
reality far-removed from my lofty aspirations, one where little at- 
tention was paid to the needs of these young kids and where selec- 
tions and retentions were based upon the things which would best 
contributed to the luster of MTC&apos;s image. 



21 

I left feeling that much of the funding designated for this vital 
need was wasted through malfeasance and incompetence. With a 
heavy and disillusioned heart, I returned to California smd re- 
sumed my previous career as executive director. 

Prior to opening Flint Hills Job Corps Center, the center director 
stated at a meeting that we would be serving 250 students; a popu- 
lation which would include men, women, and single-parent mothers 
and their children. From the onset, the director stated that we, 
staff, needed to be primarily concerned with the students&apos; average 
length of stay, or ALXDS, the completion rate of vocational trade, 
and/oT GED, and the termination rate. He also stated that he 
would not tolerate any violence on this campus, nor would he toler- 
ate the students damaging the facilities. He also stated that he 
would not hesitate to load all the students onto a bus if this was 
called for by violations of the PRH, which is the policy regulation 
handbook. 

From the beginning, we had problems retaining students, and it 
became more apparent that our student retention rate was deterio- 
rating. To oflFset this, management staff became more creative in 
manipulating the numbers. We increased our medical terminations 
for students who were experiencing homesickness at the direction 
of management, and instead of reporting how many students were 
absent without leave, or AWOL, the center would report that they 
were on unpaid administrative leave. 

As time went on, the staff became concerned with the amount of 
violence on the campus. Reports included a disproportionate num- 
ber of students of color, altnough the same act of violence was ig- 
nored when committed by a nonethnic counterpart. When the stu- 
dents would report &quot;blanket parties,&quot; beating up a kid at night in 
his room by throwing a blanket over his head and physically abus- 
ing him, the center standards officer, or CSO, would disregard this 
since it meant that a sizable number of students could be termi- 
nated for their participation, at a time which would impact finan- 
cially on the center&apos;s income. 

When students would go out during the evening and on weekend 
trips, they would often come back under the influence of alcohol 
and/or drugs; also, with these substances on their person or in 
their belongings, we were not allowed to search their rooms or 
their person. However, we were allowed to search their suitcases 
or bags. If a substance was found, very rarely did we involve our 
local law enforcement, although a close relationship had already 
been established with the chief of police and the county attorney, 
both of whom served on the center&apos;s board. 

When a student would report that he or she had been victimized 
by a gang in the center, the victim&apos;s safety was not a priority. 
Often, the solution to this problem would be that the victim would 
be medically terminated or transferred to another center, leaving 
the gang element intact. If a student did not complete his or her 
vocational and/or GED, the center would still take credit for the 
student as if he or she was able to find employment, even at a fast 
food restaurant or local McDonald&apos;s, where ne could have found 
work without the Job Corps program. 

Another concern at this center was an increasing amount of sex- 
ual activity, both student/student find student&apos;staff If a student or 



22 

staff was held in high regard, nothing was done. If it involved stu- 
dent-to-staif, depending on the member of staff and their position 
at the center, the complaint might be disregarded, or the staff was 
terminated, and the student was transferred to another center. 

I realize that these allegations are serious, and some may ques- 
tion why they were not presented to the Department of Labor in 
a timely manner. My explanation is that from the beginning, the 
regional office of the Department of Labor collaborated with the di- 
rector of the Flint Hills Job Corps Center, and they would inter- 
cede on behalf of MTC because of their strong personal ties, both 
with MTC management. Therefore, it would he difficult to ask the 
Department of Labor to investigate the allegations. My expectation 
of the outcome would have been that the investigation would have 
been conducted with little honesty and, at best, would have been 
futile. 

It is reasonable to believe that MTC has deliberately misrepre- 
sented Job Corps and has failed to provide an environment that is 
conducive to young adults in achieving a vocational degree so that 
they might become productive members of society. 

I do nave a recommendation. I would suggest that a neutral 
party join the group that oversees the semiannual review that is 
done twice a year, one by the Department of Labor and the other 
by the corporate office. This will obviate the tendency of Depart- 
ment of Labor personnel to act in collusion with MTC staff to turn 
away from problem areas requiring immediate attention. It is of 
primary importance that Job Corps staff, like all members of the 
organizations that were designed to offer service to youth, remem- 
ber that their primary function is to serve the best interests of the 
youth who look to them for support. 

Thank you very much. 

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Godinet. 

Ms. Sakos? 

Ms. Sakos. Chairman Kassebaum, members of the committee, 
my name is Shirley Sakos, and I reside in Piscataway, NJ. I would 
also like to say that I live half a block away from a Job Corps cen- 
ter. 

I was employed as a staff licensed practical nurse by ITT Federal 
Services at Edison Job Corps Center in Edison, NJ from March 
1992 to September 1994. I was acting health services manager 
from March 1993 to May 1993. 

From the onset of my employment, I became aware of the impor- 
tance of maintaining the OBS, or onboard strength, of the students. 
And at our center, which was the first Job Corps center to be con- 
tracted in 1965, our center OBS is about 524 students. 

There were many times when students were on an unauthorized 
leave of absence from center, otherwise referred to as AWOL sta- 
tus. When the students returned, some would claim that they had 
been ill. I was requested by the center director to write a LETT 
form, which is a leave extension, termination or transfer form, 
which would then void out their AWOL status. This was not a pol- 
icy approved by the policy requirement handbook or the TAG, tech- 
nical assistance guidelines, but one rather developed by the admin- 
istration to prevent terminations of students and thus maintain the 
onboard strength. 



23 

I would liken this to if I had a job, and I was awav from work 
for a week; I did not call in, I did not bring back a doctor&apos;s note, 
but I showed up and said, &quot;I was ill, so cover me.&quot; 

There would be daily meetings in the center director&apos;s office to 
review problem students. There was one recommendation among 
many I recall when a student had been continually disruptive in 
classes, exhibiting violent behavior and general noncompliance 
with the program, including failure to participate in the drug pro- 
gram. He was recommended for termination by the staff ana also 
the mental health consultant, who was a Ph.D. We were overruled 
by the center director, who thought the student should not be ter- 
minated due to the already low OBS. And I refer to this as &quot;manag- 
ing by the numbers.&quot; 

Because disruptive students were kept in the program who 
should have otherwise been terminated, violence in the center was 
allowed to proliferate. I observed personally on a daily basis that 
not only were injuries sustained from fights on center, but often 
self-inflicted wounds from emotionally disturbed students. Many of 
these incidents involved drug or alcohol abuse. 

When anybody would come with an injury, we would do drug 
tests, because sometimes they were referred to us as suspicious. 

Students were often very disruptive while in the dispensary. 
Loud, foul, abusive language and disrespect toward the staff were 
common occurrences, with often threatening remarks or gestures. 
When students thought they were waiting too long for care, they 
would often throw chairs about the waiting room to get attention. 
Having to take time out to call security officers and write these 
students up denied time that should have been spent caring for the 
other students who truly needed medical attention. 

Not only did the violence affect the staff, but also students who 
were at Job Corps to take advantage of the program. One evening 
I was called to the center for an emergency. When I arrived at the 
center, I was informed by security that there had been a fight at 
the center between two gangs. The police had come to center, and 
everything was now calm, but there was a female student in the 
dorm who was hysterical. 

When I arrived at the dorm, the female student was in a State 
of hysteria, afraid she may get hurt. After reassurance and emo- 
tional support was given, she felt secure enough to leave the dorm 
to go to the dispensary for further treatment. I suggested that the 
counselor speak to her and the other members of the dorm, since 
everyone appeared to be frightened by the incident. 

There was also the issue of sexual assaults at the center. As a 
member of the sexual assault response team, I was called to the 
center one night when a student claimed that she had been raped 
and wished to press charges. I instructed security to call the police. 
The following day, the ^oup life manager called me to express that 
I had mishandled the incident by calling the police. There was an 
atmosphere that whenever possible, incidents should be handled 
internally and not involve the local police department. 

Students come to Job Corps to leave drug abuse and violence in 
their communities only to find the same conditions exist at the Job 
Corps centers. I believe there has to be a more viable alternative 
than to allow the drug abuse and violence to continue at Job Corps 



24 

centers. Students who are serious about job training should have 
that opportunity to do so, in a drug-free and safe environment. 

I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to share 
my experience at Job Corps, and also for allowing me to take part 
in the process of government. 

Since writing my statement, I became aware that the last utiliza- 
tion report reflects that approximately one-third of our students at 
the Edison Job Corps Center are taking some kind of drugs, mostly 
marijuana. When you asked about alternatives and how we can 
correct this problem, sometimes I think that when students come 
in, a boot camp type atmosphere for students who are positive and 
could be separated from the rest of the students and oe active in 
a very good drug treatment program, so that those issues could be 
addressed before thev start in the educational setting. 

I was shocked to near about the murder; I did not know about 
that until I came here today. 

I would like to share two incidents that happened. Back in 1987, 
a lady was murdered across the street from the Job Corps center 
by a Job Corps students, and he was responsible for no less than 
13 burglaries in my neighborhood. 

Also, several years ago, some students stole a car; they happened 
to be cut off in front of my house, drove over my front lawn, took 
down my mailbox and a telephone pole. So I can attest first-hand 
that there is violence, and my concern is that it is starting to pro- 
liferate. When the Job Corps were first started, I do not think 
these problems existed, and I appreciate the committee having 
oversight hearings so we can deal with these issues. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much, Ms. Sakos. 

Sergeant Stallworth? 

Sergeant Stallworth. Madam Chairman, distinguished mem- 
bers of the committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to 
testify at this hearing on Job Corps. 

I want to say at the outset that I am a supporter of the program. 
Such endeavors are vital to ensuring that some of the have-nots in 
society are presented with the means to elevate themselves into the 
realm of the haves, and in the process become productive contribu- 
tors to the betterment of the Nation. 

Before proceeding any further, you should first know a little 
about me. I am Sergeant Ron Stallworth, a 20-year veteran of law 
enforcement and currently the gang intelligence coordinator for the 
Utah Division of Investigation. It was my concepts for addressing 
the emergence of the gang culture in UtaJi which ultimately led to 
the creation of the federally-funded Salt Lake Area Gang Project. 

I was among the first law enforcement officers to explore the cor- 
relation between gangster rap music and gang culture and have 
lectured nationally on this subject since 1992. Last year I pre- 
sented testimony on that subject to the Senate Judiciary Sub- 
committee on Juvenile Justice. 

In 1989, the Utah law enforcement community began responding 
to the rise in criminal street gang activity. We quickly determined 
that a major reason for this was due to the influence of imported 
gang members by the privately managed Management and Train- 
ing Corporation and Job Corps Center m Clearfield, UT. We sought 



25 

information from Job Corps officials there as to the gang presence 
on the center which bled over into our communities. Our request 
was met with a brick wall of defiant excuses contrary to the truth. 

We questioned whether or not Job Corps officials had an obliga- 
tion to the communities negatively impacted by their program. We 
questioned whether they had a moral and ethical obligation to do 
everything within their means to alleviate the impact of the burden 
placed on Utah taxpayers bv some of their student gang members. 
To us, the answer was clearly yes. 

Clearfield officials have always assumed a defensive posture 
whenever the negative aspects of their program are raised by law 
enforcement. They promote a polished image to sell themselves to 
the community. I have learned over the years that when this image 
is challenged, when any negatives of the program are brought 
under microscopic scrutiny. Job Corps officials adopt what I call a 
siege-like, &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality, and they circle their wagons 
to try to defuse and redirect the focus of attention from the issue 
in question. 

Their most egregious effort to protect that image involves coer- 
cive threats and intimidation. I have twice been on the receiving 
end of such tactics by Clearfield officials. Their compromising of 
public safety efforts to me and to some of my colleagues in Utah 
law enforcement is at the height of defiant arrogance. Such an atti- 
tude to us is, at the very least, irritating and, at the very worst, 
contemptuous of all proper and appropriate ethical behavior. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I am not the enemy of the Clearfield Job 
Corps program, as some of those officials have asserted over the 
years. I whole-heartedly endorse the intent of the Job Corps pro- 
gram. I do, however, think that under the private management sys- 
tem, the private contractor system, as experienced in my State, it 
has become a Frankenstein monster which is rampant and out of 
control. To me, it needs to be brought back into focus and made ac- 
countable to the needs and concerns of the citizens whose tax dol- 
lars support its existence and whose lives are negatively impacted 
by the imported criminal element. 

Toward this end, I would suggest that the following questions be 
deliberated on during this nearing. First, is the private contractor 
system the best resources to administer the Federal funds in pur- 
suit of the Job Corps mission? 

No. 2, should a comprehensive investigation into the administra- 
tion of Job Corps&apos; funding be initiated by an appropriate Federal 
law enforcement agency? 

No. 3, is the money used to maintain the program receiving ade- 
quate return on its investment? Is the program having a positive 
effect on the vast number of its participants, or are the statistics 
reflecting a financial boondoggle that could be better used in a dif- 
ferent format? 

No. 4, is there some Federal guideline that prohibits private con- 
tractors from cooperating with law enforcement officials? If so, 
should that guideline be reevaluated? 

No. 5, if a social disease such as gangs is imported into 
unsuspecting communities as a result of a benevolent social im- 
provement program by the Federal Government, should the Gov- 
ernment then have an obligation to assist those communities in 



26 

funding to address the backlash of having to respond to the nega- 
tive impact of that program? 

In closing, I Feel that we must look at the current State of Amer- 
ica and the impact of its youth on the affairs which threaten to tear 
apart our society. We must ask what effect will todays youth, gov- 
erned by the ethics of gang culture, have on the structure of tomor- 
row&apos;s society if left unchecked, without a Job Corps or similar type 
of program to address certain needs. To me, the outlook is frighten- 
ing. 

As a Nation, we are held hostage by the grip of gang culture on 
the hearts and minds of our young. In the Salt Lake City metro- 
politan area, that grip, ladies and gentleman, has seized the hearts 
and minds of children as young as 6 years of age. We must stop 
the death grip of gangs. Quarantining such a social bacteria by 
keeping it confined to the inner cities rrom which it has tradition- 
ally nestled will forever be doomed to failure. We must seek to con- 
trol this problem in part through the positive benefits of programs 
such as Job Corps. 

To me, ladies and gentlemen, the youth of America represent our 
future. We must seize control now to ensure that the future for 
them is a bountiful one. Well-managed social programs can go a 
long way toward ensuring that that future shines brightly for gen- 
erations to come. 

I would like to thank you, and I would also like to offer as part 
of my testimony a partial list of crimes involving Job Corps stu- 
dents at the Clearfield facility that have warranted police response 
over the years, and also a copy of a report I prepared in 1993 for 
the Governor of Utah&apos;s Summit on Gang Violence, in which the 
first 15 pages are devoted to elements of the Job Corps problems 
we have experienced in the State of Utah. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Stallworth may be found in the 
appendix.] 

The Chairman. Thank you all very much. This has been a very 
impressive panel. I will tell you why I am so impressed, and that 
is because all four of you are dedicated and caring people who want 
to see a program such as Job Corps succeed. You believe there is 
a need for a program like this, and yet your testimony indicates 
that there are some enormous problems that are keeping it from 
succeeding in one way or another. 

I go back again to how often questions have been raised, either 
through the inspectors general reports over the years and/or your- 
selves, as you have reported to the management and have just met 
with a blank wall in being able to carry through su^estions or 
even acknowledgement of problems that exist. Ana Sergeant 
Stallworth, from your experience, you are certainly well-positioned 
to understand the difficulties that are there. 

I just think all four of you have given us some very, very impor- 
tant testimony. I guess I would like to ask all of you a question in 
general, because you have all mentioned that corrective action is 
necessary. 

Sergeant Stallworth, you mentioned a different format perhaps 
would be necessary as one of your points, if I am correct. Have you 



27 

given thought — and some ideas have come forward already — to 
whether it is a training purpose, or is it a correctional purpose or 
a boot camp-tvpe environment? What format do you, witn your ex- 
perience, think we should be looking at? 

Sergeant Stallworth. Really, that is an interesting question. 
We have two Job Corps programs in the State of Utah. One is man- 
aged by the Management and Training Corporation out of Ogden, 
OT, which is the Clearfield Center, and then we have one that is 
managed by the Department of Labor, the Weber Basin Job Corps. 

Wehave virtually no problems at the Weber Basin Job Corps. All 
of our problems, from a criminal and especially a gang standpoint, 
reside and exist on the Clearfield facility. 

My biggest complaint with this program is that I have always 
been a supporter of it, and all I have ever asked from the stand- 
point of doing my job and doing it effectively for my bosses is co- 
operation when the need arises. 

For example, if my public safety commissioner or the Governor 
of Utah asked me the nature of tne gang problem in the State of 
Utah, I could only give them estimates, because I do not know 
what exists on the Clearfield facility, because they will not give me 
the information. If you look at the report that I will submit, my 
&quot;Gangs in Utah&quot; report, I did an informal survey to try to get that 
information when the Job Corps in Clearfield would not give it to 
me, and my survey was basically every time we contacted the 
Clearfield Job Corps kids, which was every night, I would ask them 
what gangs exist on that facility, what are the numbers, give me 
some estimates. And over a period of time in 1989, all of these 
numbers were the same — about 300 gang members at that time, 
Crips and Bloods, about 29 Crip gangs, 21 Blood gangs, 7 Hispanic 
gangs out of Los Angeles, and the two major gang mctions in the 
Midwest, from Senator Simon&apos;s State, the Vice Lords and the Black 
Gangster Disciples. 

Now, that is in an informal survey. I have tried to get firm sta- 
tistics fi-om them, and they refuse to give me anything. All I ask 
is for numbers so that I can do my job. When we contact these kids 
on the street, and they tell us about their gang involvement, I call 
back to the center or have called back and ask for follow-up on 
some of this information, and the response I always got was, &quot;We 
don&apos;t have gang members out here. We have wannabes.&quot; I ad- 
dressed that issue in my &quot;Gangs in Utah&quot; report also. 

So clearly, I think the program is needed. I think that this pri- 
vate contractor system needs to be seriously reevaluated; why do 
I have these problems at the Clearfield facility, but not at the 
Weber Basin facility? Is there a management issue here? I do not 
know, but I think something needs to be done to rectify these prob- 
lems because it impacts what people such as myself have to do in 
terms of public safety efforts. 

The Chairman. Mr. Peterson, from your standpoint of audits 
through the years, do you think there is a problem with private 
contracting? Is that it, or is it something much different? 

Mr. Peterson. I am not sure if there is a problem with private 
contracting. I think maybe there is more of a problem with large 
versus small. My memory of Clearfield and Weber Basin is that 
Weber Basin is a very, very small center as opposed to Clearfield, 



28 

with a veiy large population much of which was imported from 
New York City and major metropolitan areas. 

Sergeant Stallworth. The population at Clearfield is primarily 
fi&apos;om south-central Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, St. Louis, Kan- 
sas City. 

Mr. PETERSON. Yes. So there are very different types of people 
at the two centers and very different in terms of the size of those 
two centers. 

I do have some thoughts on what Job Corps should be doing and 
what they should not he doing. Certainly, Madam Chairman, there 
should be no thought of expanding and opening new centers while 
Job Corps has $400 million of unfinanced, unftinded maintenance 
building up. Many of these centers are in very bad shape, and we 
certainly should take a look at what we have — maybe close some 
of those centers because they may not be economical to run any- 
more—but certainly we should not be opening new centers while 
we are carrying these older centers with a heavy unfunded mainte- 
nance problem. 

I think the next thing is that management needs to look and get 
back to the roots of this program. If you look at why we had a resi- 
dential training program, it was because many of these young peo- 
ple were coming from very disruptive environments, and this resi- 
dential program was about changing the environment. 

Well, what you have heard today is young people sitting here 
saying that the change is from a decent environment to a disrup- 
tive environment. Certainly if we are going to justify a residential 
program, priority one has to be that you change the environment, 
that the environment is a safe environment, that the environment 
is conducive to learning. That is essentially what the program was 
all about, but I am afraid we got away from that. I think we got 
management that was too much interested in building the size of 
their program. Down at the Department of the Labor, you often- 
times heard the thrust of getting it to the billion dollar level, in- 
stead of the concentration on the kids and on a safe place for young 
folks to be trained and educated. 

So I think if we did those two things, if we went back and picked 
up that unfunded maintenance and got it cleaned up — either closed 
or cleaned up — and we had a greater concentration on making sure 
that the young people coming into this program came into a place 
where the environment could in fact be adjusted, could be made 
safe, then I think Job Corps may be on the right course to satisfy 
this potential. But until those thmgs are done, I think there is very 
little hope. 

The Chairman. I have some further questions that I would like 
to ask Ms. Sakos and Mr. Godinet, but my time is up for right now. 

Senator Simon? 

Senator Simon. Thank you very much. 

Let me say that I start with some prejudice — I think the Job 
Corps program is a great program. I also agree with what you say 
in that it needs improvement. And I think. Sergeant Stallworth, 
your opening statement was just precisely right. It is a good pro- 
gram, but it does need improvement. 

And I would add — and I have visited a couple of Job Corps cen- 
ters — that we have to remember we are not dealing with the Sun- 



29 

day school class of the First Presbyterian Church in Topeka or the 
First Baptist Church of Cleveland or Our Savior Lutheran Church 
in Carbondale, IL, The average student is an 18-year-old dropout, 
reading at a 7th-grade level, is from a disruptive home life, and has 
never held a fiill-time job. 

You mentioned, Mr. Peterson, the $23,000 cost, and that is a 
high figure, but we also have to look at what it costs to put some- 
body in prison, and you are talking about a very similar annual 
cost and not doing, frankly, the constructive things that need to be 
done. 

Mr. Peterson, in your written remarks, you say &quot;the last Senate 
oversight hearing on Job Corps took place in February 1984.&quot; Just 
for your information, we had one in October of last year. And I 
commend the chair of this committee for holding this hearing 
today. 

Charles Masten, the inspector general for the Department of 
Labor, had these comments in testimony in October: &quot;In its 30-year 
history, the program has enjoyed a great deal of success. However, 
as is always the case for programs of this size and magnitude, 
there is room for improvement.&quot; And then he adds, &quot;In most cases, 
management has addressed our recommendations for changes and 
taken necessary corrective action.&quot; 

My impression, Mr. Peterson, is that you hit right on part of the 
problem in small versus large. When we try to deal with too many 
people in a Job Corps center, I think then we have problems. I 
think that is one of the things that we should learn in the process 
of all of this. 

The second thing, you mentioned. Sergeant Stall worth, and that 
is the private contracting system. I am not opposed to it, but I 
think we have to be very careful, and when people do not perform, 
they do not get any more contracts, period. 

One of the problems — and I have helped to create it, and I hate 
to say it, my colleagues may have even helped to create it — ^is that 
we try to keep down the number of Federal employees, so the De- 
partment of Labor and every other department try to figure out 
how can we get the job done and not have so many Federal employ- 
ees — so we contract out, when sometimes that is not the wise thing 
to do, as you have pointed out. 

I would like to enter into the record a letter from Mike Monroe, 
the international president of the painters* union, which is very 
supportive of this program, as are, I would add, the homebuilders. 

[Letter from Mr. Monroe may be found in the appendix.] 

Senator Simon. Ms. Sakos, you mentioned the drug problem, and 
I guess all of our problems are interrelated, but our failure to pro- 
vide drug treatment for people when they need it is just a tragedy 
in our society. 

The Chicago Sun Times had a story the other day stating that 
90 percent of the people who come in and say, &quot;I want drug treat- 
ment&quot; cannot get it; they are told to get on a waiting list. 

I visited the Cook County jail. There are 9,000 people in the jail, 
and in this kind of dormitory, minimum security area, there were 
about 45 people. And in going around visiting, one of the prisoners 
told me, &quot;I would like to get into drug treatment.&quot; I turned to the 



30 

assistant warden and asked, &quot;Why can&apos;t he get into drug treat- 
ment?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we have 120 places for 9,000 prisoners.&quot; 

I turned to the other people there and I asked, &quot;How many of you 
would like to get into drug treatment?&quot; and probably 25 raised 
their hands. 

Your point that we have to move on this I think is very impor- 
tant, and the gang problem. I know I am digressing from the sub- 
ject here, but oecause you have so much experience in this gang 
issue. Sergeant, if all oi a sudden, you were a member of the U.S. 
Senate, and you could do anything you wanted to do to deal with 
the gang problem, what would you be doing? 

Sergeant Stallworth. That is a dangerous question to ask me. 
Senator. For one thing, I do not believe in giving up on these kids. 
I believe very strongly in this generation. The vast majority of 
these kids who are involved in gangs and causing the problems 
which are epidemic in this country are really good kids. They are 
confused kids. They are at a stage in their lives where they are re- 
volting against something, and in many cases, they do not know 
what they are revolting against. 

I liken it to the time when I was growing up in the 1970&apos;s, and 
we had the Vietnam War, we had all the protests that were going 
on and so on. But we had something we could attach ourselves to, 
and when we went through that rebellious stage, we latched onto 
it, and whether we were right or wrong was not the issue; it was 
an issue for us, and we latched onto it. Kids today do not have 
that, and a lot of these kids, especially in my State, are looking for 
something to revolt against, there is nothing, and this gang issue 
is the big thing. They latch onto it, and they do not know what 
they are getting themselves into, and if we do not act quickly, we 
will lose them; mey literally get lost. 

When we talk about the problem out there, we are looking at 
probably 3 percent of this generation that is involved in this, that 
is causing the problem, and in my State, commit about 50 percent 
of the crimes. 

So I do not believe any of us should give up on these kids. They 
are good kids. They need a lot of help. Programs such as Job Corps 
can nelp in that respect if they are managed properly. I think we 
need to look at some other things, such as alternative programs, 
alternative education programs, for a lot of these kids. A lot of this 
generation is not cut out for college, so we should not try to force 
them in that direction when they probably want to get involved in 
a good, well-paying job, raise a family, and move on with their 
lives. There is a lot of variety. If you ask 10 different people who 
have worked on gangs, you will get 10 different answers on how 
to respond to this issue. 

Senator Simon. I thank you. 

Madam Chairman, I would just note in the back of the room, 
Sarge Shriver, who played a leading role in not only Job Corps, but 
a lot of other good causes. We are pleased and honored to have 
Sarge Shriver here in the audience today. 

The Chairman. Come on up and take a seat. It is a pleasure to 
welcome Mr. Shriver. He has been a long-time supporter and activ- 
ist and initiator of many of these efforts that have been so impor- 
tant. 



31 

Senator SiMON. Absolutely, 

The Chairman. Welcome. 

Mr. Shriver. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. Madam Chairman, thank you. 

Let me thank the members of the panel for their testimony this 
morning. 

Mr. Peterson, let me start vsdth you. I want to follow up on a line 
of questioning that Senator Simon was exploring a moment ago. 
My questions to you are just so I can better understand where you 
are coming from and what your philosophy is and really, what your 
testimony is. 

I do not think there is any doubt that any time you have a resi- 
dential facility, it is going to be, by most people&apos;s standards, 
shockingly hign. 

For example, in the prison system in the State of Ohio, we think 
we do it cheaper than just about any State in the Union, and it 
still costs us on average $11,500 per inmate per year. That is a lot 
of money. Residential facilities for young children, troubled chil- 
dren, teenage children, run anywhere between $30,000 to $60,000 
or even $70,000 a year in my experience. So I think you would 
agree that residential by definition is going to be expensive. 

I would ask you what your opinion is in regard to one of the 
basic premises of Job Corps, which is that it should be residential, 
that it is moving people from one environment into another envi- 
ronment. Is that as correct a premise today as we thought it was 
in this country 30 years ago? 

Mr. Peterson. I suspect that the premise is still correct. Unfor- 
tunately, many of the centers, or a number of the centers, do not 
do a very good job of adjusting to that environment. So that while 
some of the centers are doing an excellent job of providing a safe 
environment, an environment which is conducive to learning, a 
number of other centers — I can think of 20 or 30 of them — do not 
do a good job and are below the average in virtually every category 
of measurable benefits. 

Senator DeWine. And I think that is pretty clear from your testi- 
mony and some other information that we have received. But just 
to summarize, you would not change the basic concept — ^you do not 
like how many of them are working out, but you do not have any 
problem with the basic concept. It is going to be expensive; we are 
targeting a very difficult group in the sense that they have been 
deprived that most of us have had during our lifetimes, and so 
going into it, we know it is going to be expensive. 

Mr. Peterson. I think. Senator, that we should expect it to be 
expensive, but we should also expect it to be a safe environment 
and one in which they can learn. 

Senator DeWine. I appreciate that and certainly agree with that. 

Let me look at one of the figure that has been quoted and that 
you spoke about this morning. I believe you said that 13 percent 
of the people in Job Corps found jobs that matched their vocational 
skills. What is the significance of that statistic — and let me just ex- 
plore that with you a moment, and then I would like you to re- 
spond to that. 



32 

That assumes that there is a higher level that found other jobs 
that did not fall within the category of matching their vocational 
skills. And is the basic premise that these individuals who found 
these other jobs who do not fall within that could have found the 
jobs anyway, even though they were not involved in Job Corps? 

Mr. Peterson. Well, we know that a certain percentage of yoimg 
folks are going to get jobs with or without intervention on the part 
of Job Corps. What Job Corps seems to be is an established envi- 
ronment in which a young person can get vocational training or 
educational training and then qualify for a specific job. That is not 
the only rating factor, certainly for Job Corps, but if you rate Job 
Corps just based on how effective they are at getting young folks 
jobs in the vocation being trained, they are not terribly effective — 
onlv about 12 percent. 

Senator DeWine. Let me explore that further with you, then. Is 
it possible that Job Corps is also teaching work habits and is also 
teaching other things that might not directly show up? In other 
words, let us take another example. Let us take a child of mine 
who might have an English degree from college. That child may not 
go on to teach English. That cnild may use that English degree to 
get something else. Maybe some of the discipline that was learned 
in college somehow translates into getting a job that is, ostensibly 
at least, totally unrelated to what the specific degree is. 

What I am trving to explore with you is what are the correct cri- 
teria that we should use to judge the success rate of Job Corps — 
and I understand what you are saying about the 13 percent, but 
what I am trying to understand is do we give them credit for any- 
thing beyond that. 

Mr. Peterson. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. And certainly, as you 
point out, there is much to learn in some of these centers tnat 
stays with a kid perhaps his or her whole life and may be more 
important than the vocational training. But we do think that the 
matched employment should be part of the criteria, that if in fact 
we are going to afford this vocational training, then we ought to 
be measuring how effective that training is. And unfortunately, it 
is not as effective as one might think, particularly given the discus- 
sions that go on about the need for developing skill training. You 
know, we keep hearing that there are lots of jobs out there if the 
young folks just had the skills. Well, Job Corps seems to shoot that 
in the foot because it does not appear that we are able to get that 
training across in that environment in such a way as to make that 
person employable. 

Senator DeWene. My time is up. I do have some additional ques- 
tions, and I hope we have a second round. Madam Chairman. 

If I could, though, let me just finalize this by saying that I think 
one of the things this committee has to look at is what are the cri- 
teria that we should use for a program that costs over $1 billion 
a year, that is targeted at young people who are going to have a 
very, very difficult time, wnere the success rate percentage-wise 
may not be as high as we would expect if the criteria for entering 
Job Corps were different, and how in fact do we judge this in the 
future. I think one of the things that we should insist on from the 
Department is that the longitudinal studies be in place and that 
we truly measure not just the process, but also the results. And 



33 

with you, Mr. Peterson, I was trying to explore what those results 
should be and how we should actually measure them. 

Mr. Peterson. I think if you looked at all the statistics, probably 
the one that correlates most closely with a person being successful, 
both in terms of getting the job and the wages received, is probably 
length of stay — in other words, how long a person stays at the cen- 
ter. If we could keep that person in the center for a full year, for 
instance, the opportunity and the chance that that person is going 
to get a job in fiie field trained goes up significantly, and the wages 
that that young person is going to get upon graduation goes up sig- 
nificantly. But we have got to get back to finding out how to keep 
them there. You certainly cannot keep them in the center, listening 
to the first panel today, when the kids do not consider themselves 
safe and so on. 

So I think we need to concentrate on the environment and then 
get some decent standards. For instance, there is no standard on 
classroom attendance. In a program like this, you would guess that 
there would be some kind of a standard that says you need to go 
to class. There is no standard. So that when we went out and took 
a look at the centers, we were finding an absentee rate of 33 per- 
cent and up. The kids just are not there. 

So I agree with you that we need to agree upon some meaningful 
criteria and then hold Job Corps management responsible for re- 
porting on a timely basis, and I think active oversight on the part 
of this committee will do a great deal. 

Senator DeWine. Thank you. 

Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Senator Well stone? 

Senator Wellstone. Thank you. Madam Chair. 

Since I was not able to hear the testimony, and I know you have 
one more panel, I have just one very brief question — and I thank 
each of you for being here. 

Regarding the statistic about 12 percent placed in trades, my un- 
derstanding is that the Department of Labor, looking at the first 
6 months of program year 1994, found that 25.7 percent of all par- 
ticipants had been placed in jobs in which they were trained, and 
of all the students placed into jobs, 41 percent are job training 
matches. 

I do not want this to become just a battle of statistics, but I just 
wonder whether the panelists might want to respond to that, just 
so we can know which data we are working with. 

Mr. Peterson. Well, if that figure is correct, it is an enormous 
step in the right direction. I must say that I come from a back- 
ground that would question that a bit, and I would wait until you 
get an audited figure before you conclude that the statistic is cor- 
rect as presented. 

Senator Wellstone. I think that is fair enough, Mr. Peterson. 
I just want to point out that some of the information is from the 
1990 report, and that was 1990 

Mr. Peterson. Yes, that is correct. 

Senator Wellstone [continuing]. And there is some other data 
that I think is important, and we can all look at it and see whether 
we think it is rigorous. But I just wanted to get that out as part 
of the record. 



34 

Mr. Peterson. The reason why I was using 1990 data is because 
that was the last audited data. 

Senator Wellstone. I understand. 

Madam Chair, first of all, I would like to thank you for this hear- 
ing. I am really looking forward to the next panel — Karen Ander- 
son is here fi^om Minnesota — so I will just wait. 

I do want to make the point that I know others have made as 
well, and that I think Karen Anderson can speak about with more 
eloquence and more personal experience than I ever could, which 
is that for whatever problems there are — and one of the things I 
appreciate about what you are trying to do is the rigor of your ap- 
proach — for whatever problems there are that we have to deal 
with, for whatever accountability — more accountability has to be 
built into the system — this program also has some startling success 
stories, has an extremely important mission, and sends a very im- 
portant message to some yoimg people in this country who live 
amidst some pretty brutal and pretty awful conditions. And I would 
like to focus, of course, on the success of it, so that we can really 
build on that and make sure that we do not move away from what 
I think is a terribly important mission to Job Corps. 

I just wanted to get that on the record, and I think that is the 
spirit in which we will work together. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

I would like ask another question, because I did not get a chance 
to hear either Ms. Sakos or Mr. Grodinet respond. What corrective 
action do you think would be important? I think, building on what 
Senator DeWine and others were asking, it again goes to the pur- 
pose of the Job Corps program and what should it be for us in the 
next decade. And all four of you are supportive and feel a need 
there, but what do we need to do to answer that need? Both of you 
have worked in Job Corps centers, are dedicated to seeing it 
achieve what we want it to achieve, so I would like to hear both 
of you suggest some corrective action that you think would be use- 
ful. 

Ms. Sakos? 

Ms. Sakos. While I was at the Job Corps center, I was also a vol- 
unteer in women and community service, which is a program fund- 
ed by the Department of Labor for the women at the Job Corps 
center. I think these programs are very good for the young women 
who come into the progframs, but the main thing that I see is the 
drug problem on the center, and I think this leads to some of the 
violence. 

Before we expand the program, I think we need to look at alter- 
native methods. This week in the news was very interesting. We 
had the Bill Moyers report; I saw another program on teenage 
pregnancy. And one of the problems I saw at our Job Corps was 
lack of adequate staffing. When I would go into one of the dor- 
mitory, there would be maybe 100 girls in the dormitory and only 
two residential advisors for the primary shift, 4 p.m. to 12 p.m., 
and maybe only one at night. This is totally inadequate. 

And I think there should be better educated staff to deal with 
these problems. When you have one psychologist, one center mental 



35 

health consultant for 524 students, I think that is inadequate as 
well. 

So I think before we go ahead and expand the program, we 
should look at the staffing, the training of the staff, and whether 
we should have a separate drug treatment program before the edu- 
cation program starts for those students who come in and are posi- 
tive for drugs. 

The Chairman. Let me just ask you — I thought there was a drug 
treatment program in place for students. 

Ms. Sakos. We have one drug treatment counselor and one cer- 
tified alcohol counselor for the whole center, and then we have a 
part-time, subcontracted drug counselor, 20 hours a week. To me, 
that is inadequate, especially when you have the CAC, who has to 
test all these urines. You are testing maybe 500 urines a month 
doing drug screening. There should be somebody separate just to 
do that. The staffing is just totally inadequate to deal with the pro- 
gram. 

The Chairman. And then, too, there is no real enforcement for 
students who continue to use drugs, so you have got an unbalanced 
sort of approach there, it seems. 

Ms. Sakos. And also, I found when I was the health service man- 
ager, and I went into the managers&apos; meeting in New York for Re- 
gion 2, they were just totally unaware of the reality of the situa- 
tion. The regional director got up, and the first thing he said to me 
was, &quot;My main priority this year is to stop smoking on centers.&quot; I 
just could not believe that this was his main priority when we had 
all of these other drug problems, teenage pregnancies. In the mas- 
ter plan at the Edison Job Corps Center, they talk about opening 
a day care center, bringing women who have children to live on 
center. Before we even address that, we should address the drug 
problems. Are we going to bring children into this setting in a cen- 
ter where one-third of the students are on drugs? Is this going to 
be a safe environment for opening a day care center, or bringing 
women and children onto the center? 

I think we just need to deal with the problems at hand first, 
which are the drugs and the violence, and I think part of the cause 
of the violence is the drugs. 

I am also a police matron in my town, and again, with most of 
the young women who come in, it is drug-relatea violence. I think 
all the health issues are connected to this, and if the committee 
will only look at the cost of not taking care of these problems now, 
later on the problems are going to be much worse — the drugs are 
going to lead to health problems, the cost of the health problems, 
the cost of incarcerating students who get arrested for the drugs. 

This is a great opportunity to do something in the community for 
students who have problems. Years ago, I remember the word 
&apos;latchkey&quot; was the prominent phrase of the 1980&apos;s. Now, unfortu- 
nately, these latchkey children are known in my community as 
&quot;throwaways.&quot; And that disturbs me greatly, that we would even 
think of using a term like that for young adults in our society. We 
are a great society, and I just think that having the Job Corps cen- 
ters right now is a good perspective for students who have prob- 
lems to come, if only we will do something more as far as staffing 
and education; I think it will help.

The Chairman. I am sorry, I am using more than my time, but 
I feel this is a very informative panel. 

Mr. Godinet, could you give us a few thoughts about what correc- 
tive actions you think should be taken? 

Mr. Godinet. As you heard some of the testimony from students 
who were there, even though they said they were only there for 3 
weeks or so, the bottom line is that Job Corps has to realize that 
they have a problem, and they need to get out of the denial stage 
about the gang element. 

When I first took the job at Flint Hills Job Corps Center, I had 
a lot of experience with gangs. I listened to Sergeant Stallworth 
speak, and one of the first things I identified in my first week of 
training at the Denison Job Corps and with the first influx of stu- 
dents who came to the Flint Hills Job Corps Center was an in- 
creasing number of gang members. 

A lot of people say if you have no idea what a gang member is, 
and the director of your center is saying that these kids are 
&quot;wannabe&quot; gang members, those kids are just as bad as gang mem- 
bers. They are very intimidating to some of the students, the quote- 
unquote good students&quot; that you have on center; and you lose a 
lot of those students through termination because of the intimida- 
tion that some of these gang members are bringing into the center. 

One of the biggest things that we had on our center was this 
&quot;hands-oflf,&quot; attitude; nobody can touch the Flint Hills Job Corps. 
We were the first brand-new start-up center, and we had this per- 
sona about ourselves that nobody from an outside agency could 
come in there and ask any questions about us. We had a closed 
door policy, and nobody could come in there. And the staff were in- 
timidated from saying anjrthing because they thought they were 
going to lose their jobs. And Flint Hills Job Corps had probably the 
most educated out of all 108 Job Corps at the time that I was 
there, as far as percentage of graduates. Probably 25 percent of the 
residential advisors were taking jobs at $7.40 an hour, with de- 
grees, at the Flint Hills Job Corps. 

I visited four Job Corps centers — ^it is not just one Job Corps cen- 
ter that I visited — and I think the biggest issue is that we have lost 
focus of what Job Corps is all about. When I first heard about Job 
Corps, and I thought about the process of Job Corps and what it 
could do for at-risk youth, somewhere along the line, the impor- 
tance shifted to how much salaries the management was going to 
make, increasing the dollar amount, and the lack of experience that 
the managers had in working with the kids. You hire the line staff 
who know how to work — and they often refer to residential advi- 
sors as &quot;line staff&apos; — they hire these people to make them look good, 
and then, when they thought they were burning out and they were 
questioning management, they got rid of them. These were the peo- 
ple who understood the kids. 

So when you go in and look at a Job Corps center, a lot of people 
who have no affiliation and do not understand the students at the 
center, ask the questions of the wrong people, because these people 
are only going to give you an image of what Job Corps is all about; 
they are not going to give you the truth about what Job Corps is 
all about. The only way you can find that out is to know where to 
ask the questions and to get down there with the students and to 



37 

get out of the denial stage and allow outside agencies to come in 
and evaluate your program to improve some of the positive things 
that can come out of Job Corps for the students. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. 

Just one further question, Sergeant Stall worth, about your re- 
sponse to Senator Simon about the gang problem. How prevalent 
is the gang problem in Job Corps nationwide? Do you have any sta- 
tistics at all that would give us some indication? Is this prevalent 
nationwide? I think most of us have a hard time even understand- 
ing this. 

Sergeant Stallworth. No, there are no statistics nationwide to 
the best of my knowledge, and I will be honest — I would be very 
surprised if any one of you in the positions you have could find that 
information out, because Job Corps refuses to acknowledge that the 
problem exists. They try to downplay it or to just flat deny that 
there is any such thing as a gang problem. 

As I mentioned in my testimony and in my written statement, 
in 1989 we started addressing the issue, and we immediately iden- 
tified that the bulk of our influence was coming from the Clearfield 
Job Corps. So we tried to address the issue at that time, and we 
did not get any response. 

The Chairman. And partly, too, I suppose it is a reflection of dis- 
advantaged youth in our society today; there are more gang initia- 
tives in and among disadvantaged young people today which did 
not exist that much in the mid-1960&apos;s. 

Sergeant Stallworth. Yes. 

The Chairman. So I suppose it is reflecting that, but to ignore 
it as a problem is to then jeopardize the whole program, I think, 
and that is what we have got to address. 

Sergeant Stallworth. One of the things that happened in my 
State was that we had officials at the Clearfield facility tell us they 
tried to downplay the gang past of a lot of their incoming students. 
All we asked for was to identify that problem and let us know that 
you have this particular gang member, from this particular gang, 
in our midst, so that we can be prepared to address such issues. 

All we wanted essentially was numbers — how many gang mem- 
bers are out there, what gangs do they represent — and then when 
we contact them over the course of doing our job, we will deal with 
the issue at that time. We could not get the basic numbers from 
them. 

The Chairman. I think Senator DeWine had another question, 
but first, Senator Simon. 

Senator Simon. If I could just ask Mr. Grodinet and Ms. Sakes a 
question that both Mr. Peterson and Sergeant Stallworth ad- 
dressed. The idea of having smaller Job Corps centers, smaller 
numbers, they have both indicated that that makes sense. Does 
that make sense to you, too? 

Mr. GoDiNET. Absolutely. I believe that a smaller Job Corps cen- 
ter with smaller numbers — instead of opening up new centers, have 
a waiting line of students wanting to come in, and show the suc- 
cesses of the students who are already there. It makes no sense to 
open up a new Job Corps center and bring a lot of other students 
into the same tjT)e of environment without improving the existing 



38 

environment that you have in Job Corps. So I do beheve that that 
is a very important issue. 

I also think that Job Corps cannot be used as a substitute for 
jail. A lot of students that I met with indicated that their probation 
officer told them, &quot;Either you go to Job Corps, or you go to jail.&quot; 
That perception in the community is what went out in Manhattan, 
KA and in the Midwest during tnat time, and that was the wrong 
perception of the community about Job Corps. 

Senator Simon. Ms. Sakos? 

Ms. Sakos. I agree that smaller Job Corps would be better. At 
our Job Corps, we have two programs. I the Prep program, a num- 
ber of inmates come from the youth detention center in Jamesburg, 
and they are housed, and they intermingle with the regular stu- 
dents. I think that there should be a separate program for inmates. 

And the PAY program was a program where students were sent 
to Job Corps in lieu of going to jail, or that was their sentence, was 
to go to Job Corps. Again, I think there should be a separate pro- 
gram for these students. 

I think when they screen for these students, they need to screen 
them better. One of the problems I found as a health services man- 
ager was that some students were being sent to Job Corps with su- 
icidal histories, severe emotional problems — ^they needed to be test- 
ed prior to coming to Job Corps. Some of them were at borderline 
mental retardation and were not even appropriate for the program. 

So I think these students need to be looked at separately. When 
you have a student who is incapable of understanding that he has 
tested positive for exposure to tuberculosis, and he needs to take 
this medication on a daily basis, and he cannot even comprehend 
that, and we have to have the residential advisor give it to him on 
a daily basis, I do not think these students are appropriate for Job 
Corps. 

So I think smaller Job Corps, smaller programs, and keep it spe- 
cific. Focus on what it was originally meant for. 

Senator Simon. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. Ms. Sakos, let me start if I could with you. 
Your testimony earlier, and actually, the testimony of all the panel 
members, would indicate that build into the system todav is sort 
of an economic incentive for the contract agency to be in denial, to 
deny the violence, to keep as many students on the rolls as they 
can, which ultimately leads to. Sergeant Stallworth, what happens 
when you try to investigate and find out and get some information, 
no one wants to give you any information, frankly because there is 
an economic incentive for them not to tell you wnat is going on. Is 
that a fair summary — or, I guess I would ask if anyone on the 
panel disagrees with that. 

Ms. Sakos. I agree with that. When I started getting more in- 
volved in the management side of Job Corps, everything was fo- 
cused on the numbers. We cannot terminate anybody from health 
services for medical this week, for example, because we have had 
too many already. And these statistics — ^from what I understand 
today, there has not been an oversight hearing in many years — so 
we need to re-look at the statistics. 



39 

I am told in the policy requirement handbook that I should only 
see in a Job Corps as big as ours something like only 10 percent 
of the students for nonphysician visits. 

Well, I would like to know when those statistics were written. 
Was it 10 years ago? Health issues on our young adults have really 
changed. So— especially when something is for profit — but that was 
more or less the atmosphere throughout the Job Corps, was the 
focus on the numbers, to keep the students there no matter what. 

Senator DeWine. Ms. Sakos, you have alluded to the fact that 
some of the individuals who are in Job Corps perhaps should be in 
a different t5T)e of progpram. And you talked about the alternative 
of you either go to prison, or you go to Job Corps. And I do not 
know whether any of the members of this panel can comment on 
it, but I think it is an appropriate question for the committee, and 
for the committee to ask not only this panel, but additional panels, 
and that is to try to put the situation in a little historical perspec- 
tive as to whether or not the group of individuals who are sup- 
posedly being served by Job Corps today is a different kind of popu- 
lation than it was 10 or 20 or 30 years ago. 

I do not know the answer, because I do not have the institutional 
memory, I do not have the history of this. But if any of you have 
a comment on that — Mr. Peterson or anybody else — I would just be 
curious to know whether, as we are trying to judge how Job Corps 
is doing today, we are comparing apples and oranges versus how 
it was doing in 1970 or 1980. 

Mr. Peterson. Well, there is a very strong desire to keep the 
beds full as the program speaks to it. And I think perhaps that 
drive does ensure that you are getting somewhat of a different mix 
of students today than you did sometime back. 

You speak of some of the criteria. Maybe the criteria we ought 
to apply to this program should include what kind of a waiting list 
of young folks do we have to take this $23,000 scholarship that we 
are offering. 

Unfortunately, at many of the centers, there is not only not a 
waiting list, but there is active resistance to going there. So that 
while there are some centers that have been identified by that tar- 
geted population as being good and people want to get into them, 
particularly on the West Coast, there are many centers that people 
are trying their very best to avoid. 

Senator DeWine. Well, also, is there not a recruitment process? 

Mr. Peterson. Yes. 

Senator DeWine. There is obviously an economic incentive to 
keep it filled, so there is a recruitment process which goes with 
that — ^which may not all be bad, but that is the fact of life. 

Mr. Peterson. That is a fact of life, yes. 

Mr. GODINET. The screeners who screen students into Job Corps 
receive bonuses for the length of time that a student goes to Job 
Corps. So it is almost more important that they get any kid in 
there, and they realize that a Job Corps center will try to keep the 
student as long as possible, whether the student is nt to succeed 
in Job Corps or not. So maybe you ought to take the incentive away 
from the screeners that they will receive a bonus for sending a stu- 
dent, which will protect the Job Corps center from allowing some- 



40 

one to be sent to them, and the next thing you know, as soon as 
they check on center, they have to stay on center. 

Senator DeWine. Maybe the incentive should be how many of 
them actually get jobs and keep the jobs. I do not know if that can 
be built in or not, but that ultimately is what we are trying to do. 

Mr. GoDlNET. And there is a misconception, because you have 
students who are on center for 100 days, 150 days, and then those 
students basically walk on water, because you cannot lose those 
students or they will screw up your ALOS — excuse my language — 
but they try to keep those students on center as long as possible 
so their ALOS looks really good. 

Sergeant Stallworth. I would just like to add. Senator, the 
Clearfield Center states that their capacity is 1,200 beds. They rou- 
tinely are at around 1,400, and they have even cited as many as 
1,500 in the past. So they clearly are constantly over the allowed 
capacity, and I think that goes to the incentive factor that we have 
discussed. 

As to your statement about the nature of the kids coming into 
the program today, I think clearly we are dealing with a different 
breed of animal, if you want to call it that. This problem is mani- 
festing itself all over this country. It quite clearly is a plague, an 
epidemic — you can call it any variety of names that you want — 
but gang culture has quite literally gripped this country and is 
holding it hostage. 

I use my State as a perfect example. Stereotypically, we should 
not have a gang problem in the great State of Utah. It is 93 per- 
cent white, and 89 percent of that is conservative Mormon. And yet 
I have got Mormon missionary kids returned and planning to go on 
their missions who are doing driveby shootings all over me State. 
It does not make any sense, but yet these kids are as dangerous 
to us as the kids in South Central and East Los Angeles and other 
parts of this country. 

So it is clearly something that has to be addressed. Going back 
to your question, Senator Simon, we have to look at the issues of 
why these kids feel the need to identify themselves as gang mem- 
bers. We have to look at the issues of poverty. We have to look at 
the educational factors. What is causing this thing to take hold of 
the hearts and minds of our children and make them want to be 
gang members and literally become outlaws of society? Something 
is wrong. 

Senator DeWine. Thank you. 

Thank you, Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. I thank every member who has testified on this 
panel today. It was very important testimony, and we appreciate 
your coming. 

Thank you. 

Senator Simon. While the next panel comes up. Madam Chair, 
I would like to enter into the record a response by Friends of Job 
Corps to a Dallas news series. 

The Chairman. I would be happy to do so. Thank you. 

[Document referred to may be found in the appendix.] 

The Chairman. It is a pleasure to welcome our final panel. I 
would like to introduce both of you, and then I know Senator 



41 

Wellstone, who has to be gone for a few moment, wants to make 
a special introduction of Ms. Anderson. 

First, Officer Luis Melendez, who has been a New York City po- 
lice officer for 8 years and youth officer for South Bronx. It is a 
great pleasure to welcome you. 

Karen Anderson is a Job Corps graduate, a success story and 
owner of a small business in St. Paul, MN. It is a pleasure to wel- 
come both of you. 

Senator Wellstone just wants Karen to go first. 

Senator WELLSTONE. Thank you so much. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Do you wish to say anything before she begins, 
Senator Wellstone? 

Senator WELLSTONE. Just to offer a warm welcome and my 
thanks for being here. Karen is a graduate of Hubert H. Humphrey 
Job Corps Center, a center with an excellent track record and a 
great reputation in our State. I just want to be here while Karen 
testifies, because I have another meeting to attend soon. Thank you 
very much, Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. Ms. Anderson? 

STATEMENTS OF KAREN ANDERSON, ST. PAUL, MN, AND LUIS 
MELENDEZ, NEW YORK, NY 

Ms. Anderson. Thank you. 

I want to thank you for having me here today, and I must say 
that I feel slightly like a minority, but hopefully after I tell you my 
story, you will not think so. 

I am here in defense of the program that saved my life. I had 
a life of hardship and despair, and Job Corps basically saved my 
life. 

Although you have heard about other Job Corps experiences, I 
can only tell you my own. I guess I c£in say I am your classic story 
of growing up in an alcoholic, abusive, struggling mmily on welfare. 

Where does that word &quot;classic&quot; come from? It is not a word to 
be used when describing despair. It saddens me to know that this 
type of upbringing has become all too common, and here is my 
story, my classic story. 

My father was an overworked St. Paul policy officer. When I was 
4, he was shot in the line of duty and nearly lost his life. After 
that, he became a violent, abusing alcoholic, and I would wake up 
in the middle of the night to hear the horrifying sound of my moth- 
er, a drunk herself, being beaten, at times nearly unconscious. 

When I was 9 or 10, my father was gone, my mother was a 
drunk on welfare, and I found myself raising a younger brother 
and sister. 

At the age of 16, I was basically living on the streets, because 
I had burned every bridge imaginable. By the time I was 18, I 
found myself in total despair, and I was homeless. This was exactly 
the place where even^one said I would be: Nowhere. 

You see, the word classic&quot; does apply. 

One day, I was reading the want ads, and I came across an ad 
that read, &quot;Job training. Earn while you learn. Free room and 
board, free meals, clothing allowance.&quot; I signed right up. It was Job 
Corps. 



42 

I was only going tx) stay at Job Corps until something better 
came along, because the school part did not appeal to me at all. 
But Job Corps saw me coming, attitude and all. The messages I got 
from them were: No conning, no Ijdng, and no destructive behavior 
whatsoever — although I did give them a rwn for their money, until 
1 day, my BAM instructor called me into his office, and he asked, 
&quot;Karen, aid you ever consider going into sales for a living?&quot; 

I replied, &quot;No.&quot; 

Then he said, &quot;Well, you should. You are the biggest con artist 
I have ever met in my life. Now get out of my office. 

Wow, these people really knew me pretty well. That was the day 
I started my new life. Job Corps really did change my life. It gave 
me the opportunity to learn job skills, do some self-healing, learn 
communication skills and new and better life skills. Job Corps gave 
me a vision. Job Corps taught me to take responsibility for my ac- 
tions and credit for my accomplishments. 

At times, I struggled through the program, but Job Corps did not 
give up on me. Job Corps taught me tnat I was really important 
and that I should not give up on myself. So I did not. I completed 
the Job Corps program, and it was the proudest moment of my life. 

Like many other 17- and 18-year-olds in the Job Corps, when I 
left, I did not find a job in my trade, but I did not give up. Job 
Corps taught me that if you do not find a job in your trade, just 
findf a job. 

I found a job working at a 7-Eleven for about a year. It was the 
first time in my life I could ever pay rent. I then moved to Califor- 
nia, where I got a job working in a copy center. Eventually, we got 
a computer in the store, and I started messing with it after work. 
I decided that this was it; this was what I came here for. 

I taught myself how to use the computer and how to do design 
work. Ironically, after leaving California and returning to Min- 
nesota, I found myself unable to find a job because I was overquali- 
fied. 

With my new skills and the commitment to succeed which I dis- 
covered at Job Corps, I got an entry-level position working at a 
new sign company in St. Paul. I proved to be an asset to the com- 
pany and presented the owner with a business plan to incorporate 
graphic design into our sign business. 

With trust in me, she made an investment for the company&apos;s fii- 
ture and made me a 50 percent partner. We have been open for 5 
years now, and the business is very successful. We are an active 
business in the community, we pay taxes, and we do a lot of com- 
munity work. We also act as a work experience site for other Job 
Corps students. 

So you can say I may not have gotten a job in my trade, but at 
least I got a job. In fact, I have never been unemployed since I left 
Job Corps. Now I am a business owner, giving back to the commu- 
nity more than I ever would have if I had stayed in my trade. 

And for those who say that the program is not serving enough 
and is not worth the investment, I would say that in taxes alone, 
I more than paid back the Grovemment for my stay at Job Corps. 

I am not alone. Each year, the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps 
Center serves and helps 500 students. Seventy-five percent of them 
get jobs, join the military, or pursue ftirther education. That is just 



43 

the tip of the iceberg when you consider there are 88,000 poor kids 
in the State. 

That is why about a year and a half ago, I became a part of the 
Job Corps system again as an advocate. In the spring of 1994, the 
Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center, the Midway Chamber of 
Commerce and my company planned and participated in a graffiti 
removal project. It was a one-day event, and teams of volunteers 
were sent out into the streets of our community to clean up vandal- 
ism off of our buildings. 

The following Monday, I got a call from a local bank executive 
who helped in the cleanup. He said he was amazed at how sincere, 
caring and hardworking the students from the Job Corps center 
were and that he felt guilty about his opinion of Job Corps before 
that day. On a greater scale here today, I wish to hear the same 
reaction. 

I also got a call from a local business owner who said that in the 
20 years that he had been in business, no one had ever done any- 
thing this good for the community. What a proud moment for Job 
Corps. Those students finally got the respect they deserved. 

That event was just one of many proud moments for those stu- 
dents. I truly believe it is not always the big college grad who 
makes and gets opportunities. Job Corps gives young, disadvan- 
taged adults their spirits back. 

I met a young woman named Samantha 2 weeks ago. She had 
graduated from Job Corps and was just starting out on her own 
and had nothing to furnish her apartment with. So I went to 
Samantha&apos;s to bring her some items for her apartment. What we 
found was a rundown efficiency with not one ounce of furniture, 
not even a lamp. But she could have cared less. She had a job, and 
she was proud of herself and her accomplishments. She told me she 
was going to get some furnishings eventually, but she was happy 
just the way things were. Furniture was not even relevant. And I 
remember myself, when I left Job Corps — it did not matter to me, 
either. I am sure Samantha will not be unemployed again if she 
has anything to do with it, thanks to Job Corps. 

Newt Gingrich once said, &quot;If you are on welfare, you are not 
free.&quot; That is true, because I have been there. 

So I would like to close my testimony with a question. If you 
were 18 years old, unemployed, homeless, and without resources, 
would you a) enter the Job Corps program, where you have a 
chance at a better future, or b) enter the system of the not free? 

I made my choice, and I am very proud of it. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. 

Officer Melendez? 

Mr. Melendez. Good afternoon. Madam Chairman and distin- 

?iished Senators. My name is Luis Melendez. I have been a New 
ork City police officer for 8 years, assigned to the 46th precinct 
as a youth officer. 

I am here to officer testimony based upon my personal experi- 
ences with the South Bronx Job Corps Center, 

As a youth officer, my primary function is to act as a liaison with 
the community in dealing with all area youth in the Bronx. 
Throughout my tenure as a youth officer, one of my most positive 



44 

experiences has been the special relationship the precinct has 
shared with the South Bronx Job Corps Center. 

As a youth officer, I have had the opportunity to visit a number 
of schools within the precinct area, as well as to be in a position 
to be acutely aware of negative incidents that occur daily in the 
New York City public school system. In contrast to what is happen- 
ing in both tne schools and in the streets, the South Bronx Job 
Corps Center offers a safe sanctuary for those kids who believe 
that an education is still their ticket out of an uncertain future. It 
not only offers them an opportunity to complete their education, 
but for many, the residential setting has helped countless youth es- 
cape homelessness, hunger, abuse, and other conditions associated 
with their home environments. 

The majority of the South Bronx Job Corps Center student popu- 
lation is from the immediate Bronx area, where most of the youth 
of the same age category are high school dropouts. Yet I am aware 
that many of the South Bronx Job Corps students are now attend- 
ing college-accredited courses throughout the City University of 
New York system. 

Many kids from the Bronx are borderline in that a little push ei- 
ther way makes a difference. These kids by and large do not have 
the sense that anyone cares, but they do when they become stu- 
dents at the South Bronx Job Corps. 

The foundation for the success for the South Bronx Job Corps 
Center is &quot;tough love,&quot; with a strong focus on old-fashioned values. 
&quot;Doing the right thing is the only thing&quot; is a way of thinking and 
a way of life. Often, this may be the first time these young people 
have been made to understand what is acceptable and unaccept- 
able behavior and that every action has a consequence in a manner 
which is supportive and nurturing instead of hostile and threaten- 
ing. 

The staff work hard to impress that living by these values will 
be necessary for the young adult to get and Keep a job somewhere 
down the line. 

Over time, reverse peer pressure is a natural progression. So 
many of these kids come to truly believe that Job Corps is their 
salvation, that it is a wonderful privilege, and they themselves 
exert pressure over their peers to behave and get the most out of 
their experience while at the center. This generates a tremendous 
amount of positive motivation among the student population and, 
coupled with a consistent discipline system that sanctions inappro- 
priate behavior and extensive counseling support, makes for a win- 
ning formula. 

The premise of practicing ^ood values is constantly being rein- 
forced with a reward system m place for positive behavior and re- 
sults, be it in the student&apos;s educational and vocational progress, or 
learning to live and become self-sufficient among 250 peers of sev- 
eral different nationalities. 

Over the year, there have been very few calls to the 46th Pre- 
cinct from the center on violence-related activity, and whenever I 
have visited the center, the halls and grounds are free of graffiti 
and trash. It is my impression that the South Bronx Job Corps is 
doing a terrific job with these kids, and I understand it is rated one 
of the best in the country. 



45 

Every day and in every way, the message at the South Bronx Job 
Corps Center is to strive for excellence. Over the years, the stu- 
dents and the staff of the center have become the oest neighbors 
to the 46th Precinct and its community members. They have 
opened up the facility to host a number of events, including joint 
community relations meetings held monthly. They have hosted and 
catered a number of meetings for community-based organizations 
that do not have the room or the resources to do so on their own. 

Every year, the 46th Precinct is host at the center for the police 
clergy conference, the police business conference, and the police fel- 
lowship breakfast. 

When our community members need assistance cleaning up a 
park or renovating a church, these kids are there. They have orga- 
nized and participated in anti-drug and anti-violence rallies, 
worked in soup kitchens, delivered meals to their peers in the ado- 
lescent AIDS ward of Montifiore Hospital, collected and wrapped 
boxes of toys for the 46th Precinct&apos;s &quot;Toys for Tots&quot; campaign every 
year — and the list goes on. 

Every year, our precinct sponsors a talent show for the commu- 
nity though, and South Bronx Job Corps Center students with both 
students and police officers participating alike. The center has par- 
ticipated in the &quot;Cop of the Month &quot; program, which recognizes he- 
roic behavior from my fellow police officers. Job Corps students are 
part of the monthly ceremony, presenting the awards with our com- 
manding officer. 

ClearW, for a lot of these kids, this positive interaction is the 
first such interaction they have had, and likewise, both cops and 
kids share the experience as partners, breaking down the barriers 
and historical way students have viewed law enforcement in the 
past. 

Students from the South Bronx Job Corps Center lead by exam- 
ple, and as a police officer, I must say that one way or another, we 
will deal with most of the youth in the community. Watching the 
students at the South Bronx Job Corps Center growing into caring 
and responsible adults, and channeling their energies into positive 
things is very rewarding personally, versus meeting up witn them 
in a public safety arena. 

Our precinct is very grassroots-oriented, and after 7 years of 
working with the South Bronx Job Corps Center, I can without 
hesitation say that they are one of our best neighbors. If schools 
in New York City and throughout the Nation could replicate what 
goes on at the South Bronx Job Corps Center, my job would be 
easier. 

Many articles have appeared in the New York City newspapers 
about the severe adolescent high school dropout rate. Job Corps 
fills a much-needed niche that, if not available, would surely result 
in an even bleaker picture. 

In closing, I know what the South Bronx Job Corps Center 
means to the kids from the Bronx. It means breaking free of gen- 
erations of poverty and getting much more than piece of paper 
when they leave. It means receiving love and support that they 
may never have experienced. It means learning to be a productive 
member of our community and giving something back uncondition- 
ally. It means everything to some of these kids, especially those 



46 

waiting to get in and those we know are still out there who need 
the services. 

From my experience as a member of the New York City Police 
Department, 46th Precinct, Job Corps works. 

Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Melendez may be found in the 
appendix.] 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. I appreciate the testimony 
from both of you ,and I will reserve my time for questions and yield 
to Senator DeWine, since Senator Wellstone is not back yet. 

Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. Madam Chairman, I really have no questions. 

I would just say we appreciate your testimony very much. Your 
testimony clearly indicates that Job Corps can work and that it cer- 
tainly is very, very cost-effective in some cases. I do not think this 
hearing todav is about whether it is worth it to spend $20,000, or 
$22,000 or $24,000 to save a human being and turn their life 
around. I think it clearly is. I think the question is whether or not 
Job Corps as it is currently constituted is the best use of those 
funds, and your testimony, Ms. Anderson and Officer Melendez, 
has been very, very helpful to me. 

Thank you. 

The Chairman. Senator Wellstone? 

Senator Wellstone. Thank you, and I apologize to both panel- 
ists for missing their testimony, which 111 read later with interest. 
Every once in a while — and I know my colleagues know exactly 
what I am going to say — every once in a while, a phone call comes 
at exactly the time you want to be in committee. So my apologies. 

First of all, let me thank both of you. Mr. Melendez, and Karen, 
whose draft testimony I did get a chance to read before coming. I 
would like to ask a couple of questions. 

Karen, you have been willing to kind of lay bare your own per- 
sonal life because you feel so strongly about the importance of Job 
Corps. And of course, it is great because in Minnesota, it is named 
after a great Senator, the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center. 

But what would have happened to you if you had not found Job 
Corps? I know it is sort of hard to look back, but I think we need 
to understand what this all means in personal terms. 

Ms. Anderson. Well, I cannot say tliat I would have stayed on 
welfare, but I am sure I would have been on welfare for quite a 
while. I would say that I had a lot of problems personally — alcohol, 
myself — and I just do not think I was old enough or intelligent to 
make major decisions in my life. I probably would have just stayed 
where I was. I did not really have the smarts to interview for a job 
even at minimum wage, like McDonald&apos;s or something like that, or 
the clothes or anything. I felt like I was at a point in my life where 
I just did not have a thing, any means to really pursue a life. 

So I probably would have been on welfare, public housing, and 
getting foodstamps for quite a while if I had not entered the Job 
Corps system. 

Senator Wellstone. I have a couple of other specific questions. 
I know that this letter from George Foreman has already been re- 
ferred to, but I want to just read the last paragraph again because 



47 

of the way in which I think it reinforces your testimony, Karen, or 
your testimony reinforces this letter. 

The last paragraph of this letter from Greorge Foreman to the 
chairman of our committee reads: &quot;Job Corps has known both 
praise and criticism, winners and losers. As one who was in it, 
knew it from the inside and the hopelessness of those to whom it 
reached out, I have always felt it attacked a problem likely to be 
with us always, and until something comes up that is a better way, 
it should be retained. To me, it was indeed a friend in need. It is 
a sad moment in one&apos;s life when he denies his roots or where he 
comes from, but I acknowledge that whatever I have been and am 
today, the Job Corps was my starting point. Treat it kindly. Job 
Corps took me from the mean streets and out of a nightmare life- 
style into a mode where the most incredible of dreams came true.&quot; 

My point, before I just ask a couple of more specific policy ques- 
tions, is that at this hearing, it should be emphasized that however 
we talk about improving this progn&apos;am, however we talk about mak- 
ing this program accountable, however we talk about streamlining 
this program, let that be only with the purpose of providing con- 
structive criticism. Let it not be for the purpose of weakening this 
program or abandoning our commitment to the mission of this pro- 
gram, because there are many problems with many different poli- 
cies in this country — I cannot think of one program that does not 
have its problems and its imperfections — ^but that cannot detract 
from what Mr. Foreman is saying here today. It cannot detract 
from the testimony of the two of you, because if you think about 
it, it is the same old story — either you make the investment in 
young people in the skills and the health and the intellect and the 
character of young people, and you have hope for them and what 
they can do for our country, or you pay the price later on. And 
when I think of the cost of this, and then I compare the modest 
cost of your training, Karen, versus who you have become and what 
you do with your business and what you contribute to the commu- 
nity, it seems to me that this is a very worthwhile investment. And 
I believe that that is what Mr. Foreman is trying to say; I believe 
that this is what you are trying to say. 

I would say to the chair that I hope that whatever we do is only 
in the direction of building on this program and improving it, not 
in the direction of moving away, financially or in any other way, 
from what I think is a very, very important commitment and a 
very successful program. 

Mr. Melendez, since I missed what you had to say — and I apolo- 
gize for that — given what Fve just said, what is your sense of Job 
Corps&apos; mission? Should we build on what is there, should we try 
to make it stronger and more positive and expand it, or do you 
think there is a need to begin to scale back this program? 

Mr. Melendez. I can only answer that as to how it applies to 
my job as a police officer in the Bronx. The Job Corps that I work 
with is a vital resource for a lot of the kids that I deal with. You 
have to understand that working with today&apos;s youth is hard 
enough; you have to have things at your disposal, tangible things, 
that they can get into and that can give them some kind of hope, 
can give them a way out. 



48 

Lots of times, they feel that people are too caught up with other 
issues and do not have time for them. The sergeant was speaking 
about gangs before, and I think it is a sense of family and a sense 
of support that they are lacking, and with the Job Corps that I deal 
with, that is the sense I get. We deal with a lot of different organi- 
zations in my precinct, and we do develop a sense of family, where 
we deal with each other on a professional level, of course, but we 
have helped each other so much that it is more of a family type 
of atmosphere, and the kids see that, the kids that I deal with. 

I do not have to State enough how hard it is for a police officer 
nowadays to deal with youth. 

Senator Wellstone. Thank you. 

And the final question for the two of you — and Madam Chair, I 
have visited the Hubert Humphrey Center in St. Paul and had a 
chance to meet with a lot of the students and staff and to talk to 
them about their lives, and also have had a chance to talk with the 
graduates and have seen what they have been able to do in their 
lives — what would each of you say about Job Corps&apos; mission? The 
most important thing is that this hearing begins to lay the basis 
for that analysis. 

What would each of you say is the single most important key fac- 
tor for success, based upon your own experience, so that we can 
make sure that that is a part of all of the Job Corps programs — 
because that is key if we are going to maintain this program, and 
build on what we&apos;ve done in the last 30 years. We had better not 
move away from our commitment to the program. Are there ways 
of improving the Job Corps to make it more effective. 

Ms. Anderson. It is obvious to me that from what I have heard 
today, it is who is running the Job Corps center. It is good manage- 
ment. I know that the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center is 
run by the Vanel Corporation, who obviously must do a tremendous 
job running that center, because I see nothing but positive. And 
when there is negative in any situation there, it seems to get taken 
care of pretty quickly. 

I was shocked to hear some of the stories today. I would say 
management. You know, it starts from up top; it is your staff. I 
think it is important that maybe those Job Corps centers in those 
real hard areas need more security. 

You know, when I went to Job Corps, I did not just get out of 
Yale. I was living on the streets; I was a mean kid; I caused a lot 
of trouble. But I learned to accept that troubled side of myself as 
a positive in how I brought it into my future. 

So I think management has a lot to do with how those Job Corps 
centers are being dealt with. 

Senator Wellstone. Thank you. 

Officer Melendez? 

Mr. Melendez. I would pretty much piggyback on what Ms. An- 
derson said. I think you have to accentuate the positive and the 
good things that are being done. Just like in £my major corporation, 
any department, you can look at any facet of life, and there are 
problems with certain aspects, but you have to look at the good 
that is being done. And the things that are not working out so well, 
you just have to take a better look at them. 



49 

Just looking at it from my standpoint, in New York we have 76 
precincts, and what may work in one precinct may not work in an- 
other precinct. I think you may have to do the same thing with 
some of the Job Corps centers — ^look at what is working in some 
of them and maybe take some of those programs or projects or ini- 
tiatives or ideas and see if they will work somewhere else. 

Senator Wellstone. Thank you very much, and I apologize for 
my impoliteness of stepping out while you were testifying. 

Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Officer Melendez, you mentioned that what 
works in one precinct might not work in another. As I understand 
it, the South Bronx Center has as their students only those from 
the South Bronx area; is that correct? 

Mr, Melendez. I think it is a little wider than that. I am not 
sure, but I do not think they are just from the South Bronx. I think 
they probably bring kids from all over. 

The Chairman. From the New York area, though. 

Mr. Melendez. Right. 

The Chairman. In some of the centers, they come from other 
States; there is an active recruitment to bring them in. I was just 
wondering if, when you said it was sort of like family, they were 
basically there from the same area, so they did feel a certain close- 
ness, and if that is an advantage. 

Mr. Melendez. I understand what you are saying as far as com- 
ing from different States and areas, but I am a firm believer that 
kids are kids, and most kids are willing to embrace certain con- 
cepts. I think that is one of the reasons why we have gangs; they 
are following 

The Chairman. And how do you deal with that problem in the 
South Bronx center? 

Mr. Melendez. Well, I am not saying it is an easy problem, and 
you are not going to cure it overnight, but there has to be some 
sensitivity at the site. I have met people at Job Corps who used to 
go to Job Corps and are now working there. I think that is helpful, 
because the kids see that you can come into the center and go out 
and prosper and come back, and give back something to the kids 
who are in there. So that is something that you may want to look 
into, something like a mentoring program where the kids can see 
people who have made it. A lot of kids who are out on the street 
just see drug dealers making it, or people who rob and burglarize 
making it, and that becomes, unfortunately, a mentor to them. So 
that is something you may want to look at. 

The Chairman. Ms. Anderson, I was impressed that you are in- 
volved with a work experience program, that you initiated a work 
experience site, I guess you call it. I have the feeling that you actu- 
ally would have done quite well, even without the Job Corps pro- 
gram. I think you have a lot of abilities and a keen understanding 
of some of the needs that exist. You have put into place, I think, 
not only dealing with your own problems successfully, but you have 
translated that into some very positive work. 

Follow-through is one of the things that has troubled me. There 
is not good data on where young people have gone and one helping 
them. Maybe their first job only lasted a month, if that long. Is 



50 

there a place to go — tell me what you do at this work experience 
site. Do you help graduates of the Job Corps center? 

Ms. Anderson. They are actually students who are still in Job 
Corps. They call it a work experience site. After a person completes 
his or her program and has not yet left Job Corps, they would come 
to my business for 6 weeks, from 8 o&apos;clock in the morning until 2 
o&apos;clock in the aftiemoon, and treat it as their employment. 

I feel like my work experience site is kind of special in the sense 
that we do not necessarily cater to the office occupation student, 
the BAM student, the TCU, culinary arts, or whatever; but we 
bring students into my business so that they can see first-hand 
what it is like to operate a small business, whether they are in cul- 
inary arts or any other trade that they took, so they can see what 
happens in accounting, what happens up front with the customers, 
how do we rim production through. 

So every Job Corps student that I have had in my store has just 
been a tremendous help. They have all worked hard, they have 
really tried hard to prove themselves. And that is kind of the sad 
part where I feel bad about those students, because they have to 
work twice as hard as the next guy. They really have to try to 
prove themselves, and it is very important for those kids in Job 
Corps to see a business operating and how things work and all 
that. So I feel that it is really an important part of Job Corps. 

The Chairman. I agree with you, and I am really pleased to hear 
what you are doing in that regard and how that is working. 

I would gather that both of you feel that if there were a drug or 
violence problem at the centers with which you have been involved, 
that it was not great; is that correct? 

Ms. Anderson. The Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center real- 
ly does have zero tolerance policy. Did I see drugs while I was in 
Job Corps? Absolutely, I did. On a large scale? No. But at the same 
time, if I were to look back on it, that exactly the kind of kids who 
go to Job Corps, people who are going to turn it around. But those 
people did not last long at Hubert H. 

The Chairman. They were either dismissed or helped; is that 
right? 

Ms. Anderson. We did not have zero tolerance while I was in 
Job Corps, but I will tell you they did get a lot of chances. But I 
think it does not matter how old you are, 17 or 47, if you are not 
going to take to having somebody help you, then you need to leave, 
obviously. 

I think people get to the point where they say this is not working 
for this person, and they are not helping us in any way, and so 
they do not last in the program; but that is going to happen. 

The Chairman. And that is management, too. 

Ms. Anderson. Management, too, absolutely. 

The Chairman. Thank you both very much. 

Senator Pell? 

Senator Pell. I have one question, and that is how do you ac- 
count for the difference between the testimony of the earlier wit- 
nesses and your own experience? You said, Ms. Anderson, that it 
was a question of management? Is that what your thought would 
be — leadership? 



51 

Ms. Anderson. I would think that if a Job Corps were nin prop- 
erly — I know that the Job Corps center in St. Paul may possibly 
be a model Job Corps center— but I gprew up on the streets, so I 
would imagine that any Job Corps that you go to is going to be a 
real tough environment, although in areas where the populations 
are either way too large, or their are mismanaged, I thinlc that is 
a problem. 

I think the basic point for Job Corps is that it is going to take 
young adults who have absolutely zero other options and get them 
into the work force, and I think that is the main objective. 

I would say my opinion, just having an opinion about it, is it 
would be a management issue. If a Job Corps does not have the 
proper security, that could be a problem. My story is very different 
from their stories. I would have never spent 21 days in a Job Corps 
center. I would have spent maybe a couple of months, to adjust to 
the environment. So I spent a year at Job Corps, and it was a posi- 
tive experience for me. That is kind of how I feel about it. 

Senator Pell. Thank you. 

Officer Melendez? 

Mr. Melendez. Actually, I was kind of surprised at some of the 
testimony and a lot of the negative things that I heard, compared 
to the Job Corps that I am associated with and that I work with. 
I kind of thought that all the Job Corps centers were like the one 
in the South Bronx, and that they were all doing an outstanding 
job. Everybody has problems, and you are going to have isolated in- 
cidents, but I was shocked at what I heard today. I thought every- 
body was going to come in here and just rave about the Job Corps, 
and so to near some of the things that are going on is surprising. 

Senator Pell. Thank you. 

Thank you very much. Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. Senator Simon? 

Senator Simon. Just an observation. My impression — and I have 
to say my experience is extremely limited — ^but from just visiting 
two Job Corps centers is very positive. When you mention manage- 
ment, I think that really is a key, and I think the most important 
point on management is not in itself enough, but management real- 
ly has to care about young people and not just the bottom line and 
how many bucks you can make on a situation. 

Officer Melendez, in your excellent testimonv you talked about 
the Job Corps participants being &quot;borderline. I think that is a 
pretty good description. And if you will forgive me, Karen Ander- 
son, you were bor(krline 

Ms. Anderson. I was probably a little bit less than borderline. 

Senator Simon [continuing]. But you have turned into a great 
asset to your community, and I think your testimony was terrific. 
George Foreman was borderline, and Job Corps lifted him. 

I think what we have to do is say that yes, we have to improve 
the situation; we have some situations that are not as good as they 
should be — but we should keep your testimony in mind. 

I thank you very much. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Thank you, and I agree. We should keep your 
testimony in mind. It is important to hear the success stories that 
do exist. I think also, because we do care about wanting to reach 



52 

those who are troubled and who go to the Job Corps program seek- 
ing help, we owe them the very best Job Corps program we can 
provide. 

And where there are problems, and where violence may exist, it 
is not fair to those who wish to succeed in that program not to look 
at it with a critical eye. That does not mean that it is not very im- 
portant, and I think that is what this committee is trying to do. 

So we value your testimony; I think it helps give us a side of the 
picture that we need to keep in mind. Thank you very much for 
coming today.

APPENDIX 

Prepared Statement of Senator Hatch 

Madam Chairman, I want to thank you for initiating these hearings to review the 
Job Corps program. 

As you know, the Job Corps has recently celebrated its 30th anniversary, it is one 
of the few programs that came out of the Great society era that I actually agree 
with and believe has done a lot of good. 

I am proud that Utah has two Job Corps Centers — Clearfield and Weber Basin — 
which have posted records of adiievement. 

I believe, Madam Chairman, that there is a place in an integrated job training 
system for a residential program. While I agree that Job Corps is an expensive pro- 
gram to operate, there are some young people who simply must get away from the 
poor and unhealthy environments that nave contributed to their unemployability, 
substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, or other difficulties. 

At the same time, I agree with your concerns about maintaining the Job Corps 
as a job training program, not a quasi-correctional program. And, I am most dis- 
turbed, as I am sure all Job Corps supporters are, about gang involvement in Job 
Corps centers. It should be obvious to everyone that steps must be taken to protect 
the integrity of the program. 

Additionally, the type of intensive residential remediation and training offered by 
Job Corps is not for everyone, however. Perhaps we also need to make more effec- 
tive determinations about those young people who can succeed in Job Corps and 
those who are likely to drop out or who may have a harmful effect on other partici- 
pants or on the community. 

I agree with the chairman that the taxpayers do not have money to waste on the 
ineffective placement of youth in Job Corps as opposed to a job training program 
liiat may be better suited to them. 

As much as I support the Job Corps, I do not believe that it is perfect. I held an 
oversight hearing on the Job Corps during my tenure as chairman of the Labor 
Committee. During that hearing, we exposed several Job Corps Centers that had 
been allowed to deteriorate. 

I believe oversight is essential to ensure program integrity and effectiveness. In 
my opinion. Congress does too little of it. Almost any Federal prop-am can be im- 

6 roved, and I support the oversight of job training programs initiated by Senator 
[assebaum. This particular hearing has identified important specific areas for im- 
provement in the Job Corps, which, if we act on them, will help Job Corps meet 
our expectations for performance as well as its own goals for assisting young people 
in our country.

Dear Cbalman Nancy L. Kassetaan: 

My aail and my telephone eince Novanber 5th, laat year have been Cull of appeals 
that I be heard fran on many subjects. Qae is the great honor of an invitation 
to ai^jear before your congressional haarings regarding the Job Corps. My 
sdiedule is so jairraed, including impending departure to Europe, a perianal 
appearanoe is iipoEsible. But I vant to be known as in Job Oorpe&apos; oomer ae it 
was once in mina. Since 1968 when I went from the Parks Job Corps C«nt«r in 
California to Mexico City vhere I von my Olyapic Gold Medal, I have gone or 
record before all Kinds of audioncss and in one Congressional hearing about vhat 
a youthful direction-changer it was for oe. It vas acre t^an a slclll training 
experience. It shoved me there -were well-intentioned&amp;caring people fran the

there was matching effort and response from us youthful disadvantaged in quest 
of opportunities they provided first steps frou the swamp we were in and that 
there was a way out and up In lives for which no hope was apparent before. 

Job Corps has Icnown both praise and criticisn, winners and losers. As one

Dear Senator Kassebaun: 

I aja writing to share vith you my firm support of the Job 
Corps program, 

I am a volunteer who contacts Job Corps completers when they 
return to Polk County, Iowa. I have assisted them with finding 
jobs, going on to college, locating housing, and securing medical 
care . 

In addition, I have visited six Corps centers during the past 
year to improve my follow-up skills with these young men who 
are usually beginning their first job in the &quot;real world&quot;. 

I&apos;ve observed that the finest training programs at Job 
Corps Centers are those which are in partnership with free en- 
terprise corporations. My conclusion is that we need to encourage 
more of this kind of cooperative opportunity for at-ristf young 
men who are being equipped for Lifetimes of tax-generating and 
incoae producing employment. 

I am proud to be one of thousands of volunteers all across 
America who are able to help many Job Corps completers make 
successful transitions into our nation&apos;s workforce. 

If there are any ways I may work with you to improve Job 
Corps training for at risk youth please feel free to solicit my 
support. 

IhiaUH you for your leadership.

Prepared Statement of Gerald W. Peterson 

Madam Chairwoman and Members of the Committee: 

I am pleased to appear before you today to testify on the 
Job Cflrps Program, Specifically, I will attempt to 
convey some o£ my concerns that result in unsatisfactory 
performance outcomeB by students. 

Concern II - Lack of Conaras sloBal Oversight . The last 
Senate oversight hearing on Job Corps took place in 
February 1984. For a program costing more than a billion 
dollars a year, you should do better. 



56 

concern •2 - Lack of Maaaaf ■«»»*• Co»»it:«eBt. My Initial 
briefing of you and your staff pertaining to much of the 
data I will discuss today was dlsnissed as &quot;erroneous . 
or misinterpretations of Isolated facts&quot; by 
secretary Reich. The current Director of Job Corps told 
me I was wasting his t lae when w« bciefed him on this 
data and in fact refused subsequent briefings offered on 
our &quot;Analysis of Costs Invested In Human Capital In the 
Job Corps Program.&quot; 

Concern 13 - Policy and pTa^rmm Prnhlaan. 

$100 nlllion spent with no measurable benefits - 
15\ of the resources Invested in the Job Corps 
program had no measurable return. Participant 
did not get a job within six-months of leaving 
the program, did not demonstrate any educational 
achievements, and did not complete a vocational 
program. There were 13,112 students who fell 
into this category in PIE 1990. This represented 
20. 6X of total output. 

Students are not being placed in jobs for which 
they are trained - Only 13% found jobs that match 
the vocational skills they gained in the program 
for Pys 1990. 

In pre 1990 24.1% of the total Job Corps 
participants were lost in the system - Job Corps 
simply do&lt;^s not know what happened to them. 
Knowing what happened to students after leaving 
Job Corps is essential, before any evaluation of 
program effectiveness is possible. 
Approximately 1 out of S of the total Job Corps 
participants are not placed In any job, returned 
to school, or entered armed forces. 
Only about 17% of the total Job Corps funds 
actually went towards educational/vocational 



57 

training In PYE 6-90. Co«t« were Incnrred In tbe 
Eollowlng cateqorles: 

* Aaalnlatration - 26% 

•t^ Residential Ilvlnq - 24% 

* Educational and vocational training - 17% 

* Facilltlas, cquLpaeot, and 
depraciatlon - 14% 

* Allowances - 10% 

■i- Medical and Dental - 4% 
f Outreach, ■cccenlnq, plac«nent-3% 
4 Travel and transportation - 2% 
Consistently poor partoralnq centers are not 
closed. Thase poor performing centers place 
fewer students upon termination, assist Cewer 
students In obtaining their GEO or in achieving 
learning gains, have fewer atudente who complete 
their vocational training, and have a higher 
turnover o€ students. At some point. Job Corps 
must decide whether it Is wise to continue to 
invest in a center which Is performing poorly 
and not meeting program objectives, or whether 
these funds are better invested elsewhere. 
There la $400 millioD in unfunded renovations 
necessary to make the currant Job Corps centers 
a more desirable environment and conducive to 
learning and Intensive training. This may help 
to explain why In PYE 1990 39% dropped ont within 
the first 90 days. Job Corps management says the 
drop out rate results from Its strict discipline 
which they see as a sign of the program&apos;s 
success. In actuality only 13% drop out for 
disciplinary reasons. 



Job Corps Is a very expensive program, costing tax payers 
over $1 billion a year. This translates to about 823,000 
per year, per participant. I believe that program 
operations and performance need to be carefully evaluated 
and corrective action taken if we are to continue 
investing in this program.

Prepared Statement of Ron Stallworth 

Madam nhairwuman, disdngoisfacd members of the comminB&amp;, Udies aoi gcntlcmcii; I 
wani to Thank&quot; you for allowmg mc this opportunity to present tEstimony on a matter I feci is 
crucial in adrtressmg the needs of a particular s^ment of American yootiL Before proceeding 
atty further I would first like to introduce myself. 

I am Sergeant Ron Stall-worth, of ^ Utah. Depanmenr of Pnblic Safety&apos;s Division of 
Investigatioiis. I have been a law enforrgment ofBccr for approrimaiely 20 years. I am the 
senior gang investigator in the State of Utah and axuemly serve as its Gang Intsnigeoce 
Coordinanir. I have been invtiLved in the Utah law enfbrcement response effon against gangs 
. stnrr. its JTirrption in April, 1989. It was rny concepts for addiessiiig this issue diar later tesuhed 
in the creation of ±e federaHy flmdcd Salt Lake Area Gan£ Prqjca (a mnlti-jurisdicrioiHl gang 
suppression and diversion unit). In addition I was a pioaaeer in the study of gang behavior and 
mentality as espiessed in the tyncs of &apos;gangster&apos; r^ music. I have authored two selT-pobiistied 
boGJcs on the snbjcct and have coaducted uaiiiiiig throu gh o ut the councry ar seminars sponsored 
by federal law enfarcemect agencies. rnrinAm^ the offices of the Drug Enforcement AdminiS&apos; 
nation, Btffcan of AlcohoL, Tobacco&amp;Fiteanns, U.S. Marshall&apos;s Servioe, Dwaitment of Agri- 
callnrc/U.S. Fotestty Service, and U.S. AUDmey. In Frfjiuary, 1994 1 presented testimony on 
the sobject of &apos;gangster&quot; rap music to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Sobcommiitee on Juvenile 
Justice. In Noveanbex, 1994 at the invitation of Ae Naiiooal Drag Intelligence Ccmcr, under 
tile au^iccs of tiie DqanmenT of Justice, I was invited to particq»te in a Street Gang 
SynqKwium. I along with fifteen (15) other &quot;recognizBd s tre et gang experts from state and local 
law enfarcemeot agencies across the connrry. &quot; were brought together to exaxoine die street gang 
problem ftom a. Tiatinml pearapective. 

Let me state ai the onset that I am fiist and foimost a believer in and sapporter of tlie 
mission of social progiams, such as dot of the Job Corps. Programs such as ttiis, wliich. are 
designed to hi^ disadvantaged youth achieve a basic mwPTP*- of education anri vocational tiaii&gt;- 
ing, ffben efifectiv^ and responsibly mataged, are noble eSbrts on the part of the American 
consciousness and very, verv necessary. When snch endeavors are successful they embolden 
^le impacted individual to bolster self-esteem and in the process eccoarages the coniinned poisuit 
of achievement towards becoming a prodnctrve member of sodecy. 

The America of tlie 90&apos;s, ladies and genflemen, has becotne a hostile land of inane 
aggression and violent acts of defiance by the &quot;have noes&quot; of soday towards the &quot;haves.&quot; 
NowiMTC is tins attitude and behavior more evident than amnnc the youth , especially diose 
whose lives unfold amidst the fii«;mai sordid squalor in die &apos;concrete jungles&apos; of the inner cities. 

Fuel far this cycle of violent aggression frequently lies in tiie sense of disfranchismcnt 
anH despair brought on by the social isolation of inner city living Tn such circmnstanccs the 
despair I speak of ofben lies in the faihne of irtner city inhabitants to feel a &apos;connecdon, &apos; a sense 
of community, with the maiiBtieam of Amedcansodcty. Too often ttie feeling of social isoia^ 
tion results in a destroctiveiniiid-set among the yoa&amp;of iimerd^ America. In thdr misguided 
effort to express a sense of sdf-wurth and achievement^ diese young people all too oftoi fiud 
tiiemselves on the path of destruction— towards themselves, their peers (who are often innocent 
bystanders), anH the co mmnni ty-at-large . 

It theiefore becomes inqierative that those m positions of power and authority do every- 
thing within their Tnrwni: to address such issoes. If we as a society are to have any bape of 
reducing and/or dimiDBtiiig this feeling of de^tair and social isolatkn, it k esential that we 
arrest the derelopment of the &quot;rloknce as a narmal nspaose&quot; attitude wliich finds l^or 
amoog the youth of America, espcdaDy tliose in die inner dties. 

Having expressed my suppCHt for ttie Job Coips mission, I traist iktw express some 
concerns that I have r^arding tiic pxogia m. The t esetv ati ons I have are based on my peocmal 
kiKTKricdgc and tzpcocncc of having worked on the gang issue in fiie State of Utah during tiie 
past six (6) years and of involvemait in tiiis issue ficm. a TwtinnHl perspective over the cocrae 
of my roleasamCkxsIlcctDierdurii)gdiepasttliree(3) years. Ttie issue* I discuss have been 
experiexKcd, personally, by me over the coorae of my years as a Gang Investigator in my state.

(pages 2-15 spedficaJQy Hiyiif^ the connection with Job Coips). This rqpait was picpaied in 
cxnjmKaion with tJK Utah Depaitaicnt of Public Safety&apos;s 1993 Smnadt(niOa% Out 

of faimrtiR to tbc cor r cn t i«i&lt;w^»hTp of the Job Corps progEsm in OeaxfMd, Utah I most state 
that thcxc has been a iHgTiifiraint ciiange of direcdon, for te better, where concems for Job 
Corps stDdeat/gHng members arxl tiierr D^ative hnrfl^ on Qic sonounding coannunities has 
amen. Ibis change, tboo^ not as encompaasing as I and ottier gang invcstigatots in the stale 
would Uke to see, is ncnetfaeleas in mxiked conrniv to die pievioas administtation of die deai^ 
field prt^rain. 

As I stzied earlier. iiii-&lt;gi»ii« such as Job Corps are a yory necessary ingredient in the 
recipeforaddiessiDgtiaepli^it of disadvantaged yonfli in diiscoantry. However when it is time 
to add tliis ingredieat &quot;*&quot; ttB mix some impactant considerations mnst first be examined. 
Among themaie: 

1. The efiiectiveDess of the progmm. to podtively tnq&gt;aa the targeted yoodi. 

2. The locale erf (he p DJ grai n til triation to the enyiroiinientalbadcgrDniid of ttie targeted 
youth. For example, rural vs urtmiATig city ^.c., Los Angeks) vs small diy (i.e.. Salt Lake 
City). Cahnrai issnes ghoold also be aobject to review. 

3. The impact Oh (be c o u u u nni ty in the placement of certain groups of tai;getBd ycnth. 

When all of tiKse&amp;ctcHs arc considered and the end icsah is a negative, tiien yon wID 
tind tbar the comnmnily (or some vestige of die comnnmity) will explode in an oproar of 
n^ative verbiage against such programs. It is under such coodirioiis that Job Corps has come 
under dose scrutiny and severe criticism firom die citizens whose taxes st^jpon its existence. 
An ivMpnfiiTm to this would also lie with die failure of Job Corps ofRrials Id adequately assuage 
the conoems of die community i^aiding certain aq&gt;ectB of thfir program, llie issue of gaug 
involvement on the part of Job Corps student/gang members is, perii^s, the best example of the 
latter. 

in die latter part of the 1980&apos;s this coootry was impacted by a major social qndemic: 
the migration of tmiftr city gang monbers across the Vifirn\a-nA of America. This migration, 
primarily from metropolitan Los AageJes, s^ in modon a social phcnnmenon of violcrKc., anti- 
auihority defiance, and revoIuQooary arotrchism among the youth which drastically altered tiie 
larirfitf&apos;app^ of commmiilies across the nation and, in the process, destroyed lives. The migration 
revolved axoond several issnes. As staled in tiie 1994- National Drug Intelligence Center&apos;s 
&quot;Street Gang Symposirmi Report, &apos; among the reasons why street gang members migrate fitom 
larger fitva to smaller cities and commamties are: 

1. Relccatiau of families. 

2. Avoid iqpprdiension and prosecutian. 

3. Avoid letilbiition firom rival street gang moohers. 

4. In connection widi private and public rraimng and refaabilitatinn programs. 

5. New cTTTTiTnal madoets and hi^ber Illegal profits. 

6. Less street gang rivalry and coi!^&gt;etitioii. 

7. Trnwpir to fflt-fmidwfg and iittiuipulate the aintriiiiity. 

8. limitBd law enforcemcot resources and lack of street gang recogmtion/awareaess. 

This TTTi gratimi across tbe expaaae of osidguoas American states spread a cuhnral 
dynamic and aiidr auflj»jiiI i y /iTffi- fT&gt;&apos;&apos;&apos;TTnrT Twm vataie system i^dch, as a byproduct of the criminal 
association of SV*S involvBtneai, has torn, at the fthric of our socieiy. This cultural dynamic has 
empowered our youth, most notably those in the so-called &apos;at-dslc/troubled&quot; cai^ory, to tnglits 
of jrrfhvnrr&apos; and powcT previously unbeard of in the comnumities 6um which fljcy onginatBd.

Over time and under such circnmstaDces as listed above, many yotdi came nrviw ^ 
wingofttie Job Carps program (in particalar see caD^ary #4 above). In perbapsttc vast major- 
ity of cadcs these individDals saagbt out Job Corps as a legitiiiialc and bonafide ttimhh; of social 
bettEnnenL UnfommalEly, thnngh sooie of tbcsc youth hrr-ajn^ products of the progx &apos; am as a 
result of corat onkicd Trmndmr rcfcnal; Lc, &quot;join Job Corps or go to jaE. &quot; It shoald be noted 
that in my encounters widi Job Corps snirifflifs over the years, many iiave told me that tbey wcr 
in the p ro gram as a result of having committed a criminal ofBsnse in thar city of cdginand was 
given sucli an option by tte coart. 

As evidenced by my report on the history of the Utah gang mviiomnent, &quot;Gangs IiT 
Utah...,* since at least 1978 the lole of some Job Corps smdaot/gang members has been a 
negative one in teons of ttieir Tmpart cm Utah society, especially among its youth - 

In pen that iit^ativiiy has been based oo a foim of &apos;colmre shodc&apos; expezicnced by the 
tran^lantedstudeot/gang members. This ciiltnre shocJ: relates to my staiemeat on die previous 
page r^aiding locale betng given prime coosiderarion when determining the placerxKot of some 
Job Coaps students. 

For same of the inner city gang meaiilcis placed at the Clearfield, Utah Job Corps Pol- 
ity the relalivdy pristine and sedate Utah li&amp;style (in relation to the lifestyle and mttnral 
eiiviraimietitofthenei^ibcHchoods tern whiditbcycaiiie) is an alien experience. In sodi instan- 
ces it is only nalnzal to search for and/or cling to ttiar tefaich provides £ainiliaiity to a mra^. 
com&amp;Hiable zone of cxpedeace. This, in part, accoonts for the propensi^ of Job Corps student/ 
goTTg membecs to r eqxmd to the foreigoess of the Utah enrironment by rimgfng to the lifestyle 
of the gang cohure which mu t m e d tiKm. Their e ffui ts to adapt broo^ then in close contact 
with Utah youth who admired the Hi-finnt antL-atitharity/anti-estabUshnieni ffry^ of f fv^ parti- 
colar cahnre&apos;s value systoiL This, m Omi, led to the adoption of the coamer-caltiiral lifes^Ie 
of gangs on the part of Utah&apos;s yoong. The end result of this &apos;cross-breecfing&apos; of cnltuies has 
spawned anew generatiQn of hankned Utah yootb-gang members— whidi, in turn, led to a level 
of violence previoosly tmseen on the streets of Utah commrmities. 

For Utahns the inability of the Job Coips student gai^ miember to accultuiatc to a diGkr- 
ect social rfimatf! reflects a amative stain on the pristioe setting I spoke of eartier. That stain 
faindsns totiic social pheawiTienfm canaed by ti&gt;e gang migrarirm. 

As I previoosly mentiQned. rritifHein of the Job Corps program, e^xciaUy among law 
enfoiccmcnt nefjit-m throughoat tlie country who have had the nusfortnnc to come into conflict 
with its negative aspects, lies in the fubnc of hs administrative officials to respond to L^- 
im&amp;tely cxpiessed coocexos fro m the mmniiniiiiy The issue of gang involvemeot among its stu- 
dents is an cxcdlfiast exan^le. 

The Utah law e u fc a ue i nentcQiimmiii^b^an to proactively address the issue of crironial 
street gang activity in April, 1989. It was qoiddy dctEnained thai aome Job Corps studenc/gaog 
members finom the Qearfidd ftdlity were, to a great exico:, prhne reasons for doe iurrrairing 
metamorphosis of Utah youth into acc^tance of the gang culmi^ value system as their preferred 
mode of bcbarionl expiession. To aid ns in ideatliying die extent of tbc gang presence in the 
Salt Tjttnp City metropolitan area, we in the Salt Lake Area Gang Prcrject sought the aarisrance 
of officials with the privatdy tun (Managemetji and Training CcipcaatioD-MTC) Job Corps 
fiir.il ify m ClcaifieLd, Utah. The stndoc/gaiig members we were routinely encountering or citv 
streets were fiom tiiis partjcnlar&amp;cOiiy (tiiere is a second Job Coips program operating in die 
Ogdcn-Salt Lake City metropoKtan area wiach is managed by the Department of Labor). The 
nature of the assistance we requested was as follows: 

1. Name of g?Tig&lt;: represented on the nrarfirlfl facility. 

2. Names of idexitified Job Cocps gang members (or vedfication of infonxtadoD 
independently obtained biy gang invcsdgatais). 

3. Monilxrs used by f^rr*^*^ Job Corps gang mcDabcQ. 

4. Dates of btrdL

5. Social Seamty NumbcB. 

6. Home address of dc dty of ongiD of idotifiod Job Coips gang members (many dmes 
if aaindtvJdnal&apos;sgaiigaffilijstiaaisDotieadifykiiownitcanbedetexmmedbo&apos; viitD£ of a hcxne 
address in flic city of ongin). 

RegietftiOy our nm|&gt;le request far g™&apos;«^&quot;^ went unanswered. In&amp;ct, tite rwcj OTiwa^ 
cfaoscD by Job Corps ofBcials was to not coopaxte wMi our cfEorts to address public safety 
issues invidviDg a small peiccdage of tbdr stodeots. They resarted to a semantical game of 
denying tiiey bad &apos;true* gang membeis at ibe QearSdd fKdli^, botralbcrif tbcy had asyttting 
it was nothing inoic than &quot;waniBbe* gang mexobos. To nukistBnd the use of tbis term by Job 
Corps o£5cials in an eSbtt to deny a downplay tbe frisi^TK^ of gang membeis in tiimr pro- 
gram, please refer to page #12 of my &apos;Gangs In Utah...&apos; rq&gt;OTt. 

From the very b^iiming of oar contact with Job Coips ofEcials legarding tbe negative 
nnpart some of dieir student/gang members were having od tiic oxiummity, we asked a few 
simple questions: Does Job Corps bxve an obligation to iic commnnities n^atively impacted 
by die effect of its tirugram? Do Job Corps officials, in tbeir zEaknsncss to Tnumfatri smdeni 
capacity, have an obligation to assure Utah ciiiifaw Aat die social pjmi mumftfitjii ii npj rf of ih^m- 
somewhat dyKftinctinrwl famnan imports will not be a stain on the Utah lifestyle? Is there a 
moral, ethical., and puifawinnal obljgaticxi on the part of Job Corps officials to do everydiisg 
wjdm dieir means to i BU i£y (or kaBcn) die inqnct of die boidcn placed on Utah taxpayers aixl 
its criminal justice systtin by a groop of its ont-of-control charges whose basic foondation is 
rooted in placing a faig^ regard on aggression and violent expression against aiTthority. and 
whose cnlmnl eOaic is diametncaDy opposed to that of the mainsoeam? To us the answer was 
a clear and resounding YES! 

The Cleaifield Job Cocpe ptogtam is fodenDy sobakBzcd whh tax dollars which are 
administered throo^ the private Maoagemen: and Training CorporatioQ in Ogden, Utah. The 
corporation and its employees are rootEd in Utah sode^ «n&lt;i, like all citizeos in die state, iiave 
a vested inTCTPiST in issues of pal&gt;lic wel&amp;ie and sa&amp;ty. A conflict seemingly occurs when die 
interest of a private enterprise&apos;s efifbit to ensme a profit reQcdres diat they promote a false image 
to the community by siq^picssing viable infoimatian ^bdch could aid in secmlag the safety of 
the general public and which, in fact, trndetmines all legitimate efforts to ttiat emL 

PiivatBly managed Job Corps piograms mainnip a &apos;polished&quot; pnblic ft^v&gt;in order to sell 
itself to the commnnity. I have learned over the years that when tiiis image comes under fire, 
when any aspea of die pi o giam with tiie slightest hint of negativity attached to it is broo^ to 
the f(xos of public scmthry. Job Corps officials adopt a siegc-likic &quot;Us versos Them&quot; mentality. 
In essence they circle their wagons to try and diSiise or redirect die focus of attccdon&amp;om the 
particular issoe in qaestiorL 

The most ^legious act on the part of thcac officials to protect tiieir image in the wake 
of law enforrwnent efforts involving their stodeot/gang members has been tibe sobtls nsc of 
threats and intimidatioiL I have twice been en the receiving end of such tactics by MTC/Job 
Corps officials. 

There have been othex e£Eons on die pait of these officials to protect their program and 
its public image &apos;v^iencvcr conSicts or potential conflicts occor with law enteccemeoL Such 
arrogant deSance is, at the very least, im t atiug and, at die very worst, gi i ite ii ip t u ons of all 
proper peiu^lion of appropnate flthifal bdiavior. 

As I stated at the start of my testimony, I am a believer in anl suRxmer of the basic 
mission of die Job Corps pr u gr anL I camuit, lioweva, snpport such eQorts when re8p&lt;nsQ&gt;le 
rffiriaJK act itxcspooaibly to the needs and concerns of the pobBc interest wiien it regnrds 
issues of public safWy. 

My remaxics throogboot die tcstimcHiy have ceiiiBcd on the pr o gram aod actions of offi- 
dals of die Job Corps program m Qeacfidd, Utah. The aeoood piogiam I spoke of eadiei,

Is the Job Carps piugiam in Utah the only one of its land corSributiDg to die spread of 
onng coltnie Ttim nghnn t the United States? In Joly, 1993 I ti^^rifi*^ in a coital homicide trial

tcd he b^an esdnbiting gang btiiavior and expressing a propensiry towards violent acts of

I have tiad conversations widi law eufi a icem ent coDeagnes in the midwest and along tlK

I have described in my tesdmoi^. Hie only difEerence in tbeir cxpedeoces and mm^ has been

discnssions with Idaho officials of the U.S. Department of AgDcalQiic who have had negative 
eocomneis with Job Corps smdent/gang memhen;.

response to law cnfbrcemesit e&amp;irts have strictly come ouder the aoqiioes of die anient 
administratioiL 

Ladies and gcaidanen of the commiitee, I am sot &apos;^ enemy* of Job Corps, as some 
officials with the nrarfifilH program have asserted over the years. I wtolc-heartedly endorse 
the basic rntrmt of the prn gram I do howcver tiiit^ that under tlie tnffnHgemenT of certain 
private eiseqjrises it has become a &apos;Ptanlcenstein&apos;&apos; mooster tampaging oat of concroL It needs 
to be broogiu: back into fbcns and made accoadabb to the needs and concerns of die citizens 
v^bose tax dollais support its ezJEtcoce. Towards diis end I would suggest the following 
questions be asked and df^UbfrcatRd on dnring die coarse of diese heanngs: 

1. Is fie private contractor system tlic best lesourcc to adoinister tiie fedaal fimds in 
pmsnit of fiie missicHi of die Job Corps program. Should this system be abolished and reaffir- 
med orxkr the Dcpartmait of LabOT as it was origioally intended?

3. Is the mcQcy nsed to TnaintiiTn the Job Corps progiam teceivtng adequate return on its 
investment? Is the progiam having a positive effect on the vast nmnber of its participants or arc 
tiie statistks reflecting a * n«mfi&quot;^ booodog^ that could, petiiaps, be better nscd in a difCeicnt 
format^ 

4. Is tbeie some federal gmddine ttigt prohibits privaie oontracton from coopcrafiuog with 
law enforcement officials in maintaining pobUc safety by providing select infbrmwrinn on &apos;prob- 
lem* stndcnls? If so should it be reevaluated widi provisions Jifta chH tiiai would allow for 
excepdons in seiect cimniistances? 



63 

5. If a veruable &quot;social disease, &quot; such as gangs, is gomg to be imported imo unsmqacamg 
communittfis as a lesalt of a &quot;benevolent social iugjiovement program&quot; administered by tiic 
federal government; should the government fhen have an obligation to assist those connnQnitics 
in funding to address the backlash of having to respond to the negative inquct of their &quot;bottvo- 
Icnl nugcation?&apos; 

In closing, I feel we most take an imrospcctivc look at the ajuem state of America aal 
die impact of its youth on Ihc sffam -windi threaten to tear ap ait oar society. We must thpn 
mm oar sights towards the fniure and ask what effect will the yonlb of today, governed by the

I Job Corps Employee ID of man saying 
&quot;its a madhouse, the students run the 
campus. &quot; 



&quot;Weapons are not allowed on campus 
but weapons are common knowledge on 
center..&quot; 



Hidden Camera: &quot;Here a student brags 
about making weapons in carpentry 
class. &quot; 



&quot;Security guards are shown discussing 
government checks issued to students 
and how they use the funds for drugs. 



FACT: This man is an investigative 
reponer for channel 4. 

According to students, this man 
encouraged, solicited, and orchestrated 
unacceptable behavior among 
McKinney students so he could film it 
instead of performing his hired duties of 
providing for the safety and security of 
stucents. staff and property as stated in 
his joD description. 

FACT: There is a strict disciplinary and 
behavior code that all Job Corps 
students are to follow. In addition, 
regulations require between 12-15:1 
teacher-to-student ratio in academic and 
vocational classes. 

FACT: This is a false statement. 
Weapons are not common knowledge 
on Job Corps centers and by regulation 
are prohibited on all centers. 

FACT: To ensure safety on all Job 
Corps centers, center staff periodically 
check dorms and lockers for weapons, 
drugs and alcohol or other unauthorized 
items. If a weapon Is found, it is 
confiscated, destroyed or turned over to 
local authorities. The owner must then 
appear before a center review board 
which recommends termination or other 
sanctions. 

FACT: This statement is out of context. 
This stuaent voluntarily signed a 
statement saying that the incident he 
mentioned happened several vears ago 
at another eaucational institution. 



The student is enrolled in plastering - 
not carpentry at fvlcKinney. 



FACT: Job Corps students earn a 
maximum of S36.82 every 2 weeks. 
Research shows that most Job Corps 
students use this modest stipend for 
personal hygiene products, travel home, 
and clothing. 

Job Corps maintains and enforces a 
Zero Tolerance Policy towards drugs, 
alcohol, violence and harassment at all 
centers.

&quot;Why the troublemaKers get to stay.. 



FACT: Nationally about 30% of 
incoming Job Corps students test 
positive for arugs. Once oetectea. tney 
are immediately enrolled in drug anc 
alcohol counseling. Any student who 
shows no improvement is terminated 
from the program or referred to a 
community-based treatment center for 
intensive counseling. 



FACT: The female student featured in 
this scene informed the center director 
the day of the taping that it would 
appear in the news story that night. 
She also assisted Channel 4 with 
locating disgruntled students for the 
segment. The footage was filmed with 
a teiephoto lens from a van outside the 
center. 



FACT: All incoming students are tested 

for HIV and AIDS upon entry. The 
t\/lcKihney Job Corps Center has not 
had an HIV individual on center for over 
a year 

FACT: There are no reports of these 
items having been found in the 
crawlspace. If the scene videotaped by 
the channel 4 investigator working as a 
security guard had actually been 
discovered, it should have been 
reported. Nevertheless, the Center has 
sealed all 70 such crawlspaces beneath 
the older buildings on Center. 
There are 600 students enrolled at 
McKinney. Other students offer a 
different point of view. Ms. Wheeler 
remained on center 9 days. 



FACT: A total of 87 Significant Incident 
Repons were filed for a 2-year period at 
McKinney. During that time, almost 
2.000 students were on the center. 
These incident reports range from 
modest disci plinar/ action to drug 
possession. 

FACT: By regulation &quot;troublemakers&quot; 
do not remain in Job Corps once due 
process procedures by staff and 
rtudents have been followed.

&quot;They could care less about those kids.

success. &quot;

Segment shows teacher in profile. Says 
there are kids with 187 absences in his 
class. When asked. &quot;Are they terminating

at all. &quot; 



FACT: By statute and regulation. 
Congress and the Dept. of Labor 
require centers to keep detailed records 
on each student in their care and to be 
accountable to taxpayers for funds 
expended. 

The vast majority of staff work on Job 
Corps centers because they are 
committed to helping disadvantaged 
youth: certainly not because of the pay. 



FACT: Job Corps&apos; success is well 
documented anecdotally and 
statistically. Nationally. 7 out of 10 Job 
Corps students start jobs, enter the 
military or pursue higher education. 

FACT: Job Corps is the most 
thoroughly evaluated program in the 
history of federal job training programs. 



FACT: There are no documented 
reports to support this statement. 



FACT: The roommate was the 
unfortunate victim of an ill-conceived 
practical joke called &quot;hot foot. &quot; The 
student who committed the prank was 
discharged the same day it occurred. 
The injured student was treated at the 
clinic for burns to his left foot and ankle. 

FACT: Over the past year, the iVlcKinney 
Job Corps cente&apos;- terminated 1.030 
students - an average of 20 students per 
week. 



FACT: Regulations do not allow students to 
be retained who have been absent for 10 
or more consecutive days, or more than 22 
days per year 

Job Corps operators use a software system 
that tracks student absences, and this 
system does not allow students who 
exceed these limits to be retained in the 
system. Students who are AWOL from the 
center are not paid for the days they are 
absent. 

In a system as large as Job Corps, there 
are some staff that do not measure up.

Democrats have strongly endorsed the 
Job Corps 50-50 Plan, which proposes 
to gradually add 50 Job Corps centers 
to serve 50% more disadvantaged

Prepared Statement of Luis Melendez 

Hello, my name is Luis Melendez. I have been a New York 

City Police Officer for years, assigned as the 4 6th 

precinct&apos;s Youth Officer. 

As Youth Officer, my primary function is to act as a liasion 
with the community in dealing with all area youth in the Bronx. 
Throughout my tenure as Youth Officer, my most positive 
experience has been the special relationship the precinct has 
shared with the South Bronx Job Corps Center. 

As Youth Officer I have had the opportunity to visit a 
number of schools within the precinct area as well as in a 
position to be acutely aware of negative incidences that occur 
daily in the New York City public school system. 

Several years ago, the New York Daily News ran a front page 
article entitled &quot;Murder Streets&quot;. The article was speaking 
about the area in which the South Bronx Job Corp Center is 
located. It was one of the highest crime areas in New York City, 
with the area immediately surrounding the center plagued with 
devastation. In stark contrast to what was happening in both the 
schools and the streets, the South Bronx Job Corps Center 
offered a safe sanctuary for those kids who believed that an 
education was still their ticket out of an uncertain future. It 
not only offered them an opportunity to complete their education, 
but for many, the residential setting has helped countless youth 



71 

escape homelessness, hunger, abuse and other conditions 
associated with their home environments. 

The South Bronx Job Corps Center has become the one constant 
that was a positive thing in the lives of these young adults and 
it continues to be. A brief review of any New York City paper 
bears out some of the parental atrocities which occur daily in 
the Bronx. And then there is the South Bronx Job Corps Center, a 
shining light in an otherwise very dim existence. 

Ninety percent of the South Bronx Job Corps Center student 
population is from the Bronx, where conservatively, over 80% are 
high school dropouts. And yet, almost 2 0% of these students are 
now taking college accredited courses through the city University 
of New York system while enrolled at the South Bronx Job Corps 
Center. 

The majority of the kids from the Bronx are borderline, in 
that a little push one way or another makes the difference. 
These kids by and large don&apos;t have the sense that anyone cares. 
But they do when they are students at the South Bronx Job Corps 
Center . 

The foundation for the success of the South Bronx Job Corps 
Center is &quot;tough love&quot;, with a strong focus on old fashioned 
values. &quot;Doing the right thing is the only thing&quot; is a way of 
thinking and a way of life. Often, this may be the first time 
these young people have been made to understand what is 
acceptable and unacceptable behavior and that every action has a 
consequence in a manner which is supportive and nurturing instead 
of hostile and threatening. The staff work hard to impress that 
living by these values will be necessary for the young adults to 
get and keep a job somewhere down the line. 

Over time &quot;reverse peer pressure&quot; is a natural progression. 
So many of these kids come to truly believe that Job Corps is 
their salvation, that it is a wonderful privilege, and they 
themselves exert pressure over their peers to behave and get the 
most of their experience while at the center. This generates a 



72 

tremendous amount of positive motivation among the student 
population, and coupled with a consistent discipline system that 
sanctions inappropriate behavior and extensive counseling support 
makes for a winning formula. 

The premise of practicing good values is constantly being 
reinforced, with a reward system in place for positive behavior 
and results, be it in the student&apos;s educational and vocational 
progress or learning to live and become self sufficient among 250 
peers from several different nationalities. There are no calls 
to the 46th precinct from the center on violent related activity. 
The center&apos;s only &quot;family&quot; is the South Bronx Job Corps Center 
&quot;family&quot; and the halls and grounds are free of grafitti and 
trash . 

The South Bronx Job Corps Center is ranked in the top 2 5 
percentile in the country with well over 100% achievement in 
Reading (110%) and Math (104%) gains, GED attainment (157%), 
Placement (102%) , Quality Placement, including Job Training 
Match, college and/or military (121%) and length of stay (118%) . 
They have been the Regional Academic Olympic champions every year 
for the last four years, yet never won a basketball championship. 
Every day, in every way, the message at the South Bronx Job 
Corps Center is to strive for excellence. Over the years, the 
students and staff at the center have been the best of neighbors 
to the 46th Precinct and its community members. 

They have opened up their facility to host a number of 
events including joint Community Relations meetings held monthly. 
They have hosted and catered a number of meetings for community 
based organizations who don&apos;t have the room or the resources to 
do so on their own. Every year, the 46th Precinct is hosted at 
the center for the Police Clergy Conference, Police Business 
Conference and Police Fellowship breakfast. 

When our community members need assistance cleaning up a 
park or renovating a church, those kids are there. They have 

organized and participated in Anti-Drug9 and Anti- Violence 

/ 



73 

rallies, worked in soup kitchens, delivered meals to their peers 
in the Adolescent Aids ward of Montifiore Hospital, collected and 
wrapped boxes of toys for the 4 6th&apos;s &quot;Toys for Tots&quot; campaign 
every year and the list goes on and on. 

Every year, our precinct sponsors a talent show for the 
conununity youthy and South Bronx Job Corps Center students with 
both students and police officers alike participating. Last 
year&apos;s winner appeared in a Spike Lee movie. The center has 
participated in the &quot;Cop of the Month&quot; program which recognizes 
heroic behavior for my fellow officers. Job Corps students are 
part of the monthly ceremony, presenting the awards with our 
commanding officer. Clearly, for alot of these kids, this 
positive interaction is the first such interaction they have had 
and likewise, both cops and kids share the experience as 
&quot;partners&quot;, breaking down the barriers and historical way 
students have viewed law enforcement in the past. 

Students from the South Bronx Job Corps Center lead by 
example^and as a police off icer il must say that one way or 
another we will deal with most of the youth in the community. 
Watching the students at the South Bronx Job Corps Center growing 
into caring and responsible adults and channeling their energies 
into positive things is very rewarding personally versus meeting 
up with them irupublic safety j,&apos;&apos; Our precinct is very &quot;grass 
roots&quot; oriented and after seven years of working with the South 
Bronx Job Corps Center, I can without hesitation say that rhey 
are one of our best neighbors. If schools in New York City and 
throughout the nation could replicate what goes on at the South 
Bronx Job Corp Center, then our world would be much berter. Did 
you know that it costs over 538,000 a year to keep a young person 
in jail in New York City? $24,000 a year for public school, over 
$19,000 for foster care? According to Board of Education 
officials, the Bronx public school system cannot boast more than 
a 44% graduation rate which is based on attending five years of 
high school versus the traditional four. Compare that to the 



74 

South Bronx Job Corps Center&apos;s 157% achievement in GED attainment 
and over 109*: overall achievement in the criteria established to 
be considered a graduate during an average length of stay of 230 
days. The cost of Job Corps is not only less than jail or public 
school, it&apos;s proven success is significantly higher than the 
public schools in New York. 

In closing, I know what the South Bronx Job Corps Center 
means to the kids from the Bronx. It means breaking free of 
generations of poverty and getting much more than a piece of 
paper when they leave. It means receiving love and support that 
they may never have experienced. It means learning to be a 
productive member of our community - to give something back 
unconditionally. It means everything to some of these kids, 
especially those waiting to get in and those we know are still 
out there who need the services. From my experience as a member 
of the New York City Police Department, 46th Precinct, Job Corps 
works! !

Dear Madame Chairman: 

I am writing in support of the Job Corps program which has provided a 
valuable service in my state. It is one federal program that has had continued 
success in Utah and has provided needed assistance for our at risk youth. 

Job Corps makes a big difference in the economic and social well-being of 
Utah. Two centers presently operate here: the Clearfield Job Corps Center and the 
Weber Basin Civilian Conservation Center. They provide a safe environment and 
effective job skills training to more than 1,500 of our nation&apos;s at-risk youth each 
year. A zero-tolerance policy initiated at Clearfield and Weber Basin four years ago 
ensures a proper atmosphere at both centers and keeps violent incidents to a 
minimum. More than 70 percent of the students from both Utah centers are placed 
into jobs, higher education, or the military. More that 220 Utah businesses 
participate in the work experience program that each student goes through. 



75 

Job Corps provides other important benefits. The program helps prevent 
crime, provides role models for young people outside Job Corps, and produces 
workers with valuable social skills. Clearly, Job Corps is worth the investment of 
federal funding it takes to turn these students into tax-paying wage earners and 
responsible citizens. 

This success is especially gratifying when you consider the Clearfield center 
is operated by a private contractor under a highly accountable system of standard 
and measurements. The Clearfied center, and dozens of others like it acro&quot;;&quot;^ thp 
nation, are prime examples of how private business can apply innovations and cost 
savmgs to produce excellent results from a government program. 

I applaud your efforts to limit federal spending and mandates. As you do so, 
hope you will continue supporting programs like job Corps that contribute so 
successfully to our nation&apos;s future. 

Sincerely, 




Michael O. Leavitt

Dear Madame Chairman: 

I ain writing to express my strong support of the Job Corps 
program. The Job Corps program has a proven record in giving 
disadvantaged youth the skills, training and confidence to lead 
productive and independent lives. 

The Job Corps programs in Maryland have helped thousands of 
at-risk youth gain the necessary training and life skills to help 
them succeed in today&apos;s job market. The statistics on outcomes 
are impressive. In program year 1993, 70% of all the individuals 
who eucccsEfully completed their Job Corps program got jobs, 
joined the military or went on to further their education. 

Job Corps has also proven to be a sound economic investment. 
An independent study by Kathmatica Policy Research, Inc., 
determined that for every dollar invested, an estimated $1.46 ie 
returned to the economy through reductions in income maintenance 
payments, costs of crime and incarceration and through increased 
taxes paid by graduates of th(^ program. 

While I am aware of and support the need to streamline and 
consolidate the multitude of often duplicative and inefficient 
federal job training programs, I hope that the success of the Job 
Corps program is not overlooked. Job Corps is an effective, low 
cost approach to servicing the job and life Skills training needs 
of disadvantaged youth. Therefore, as you move forward with 
relevant Committee hearings on federal job training programs, I 
encourage you to look closely at the success of the Job Corps 
program. 



76 

As you and our colleagues on the Labor and Human Resources 
Committee continue to examine federal government&apos;s approach to 
job training and reemployroent issues, I appreciate your keeping 
my comments in mind .

Dear Chairman Kassebaum: 

I am writing to express my support for the Job Corps 
program. In my state of Nevada, Job Corps has reached out to 
manyiyoung people, provining them the skills, knowledge and self- 
esteem they need to turn their lives arcund. 

In these times of scarce federal resources, we must invest 
m programs that work. Almost seventy percent of Job Corps 
graduates go on to higher education or find meaninaful 
employment. Additionally, a longitudinal study conducted by 
Mathematica Policy Research demonstrated that the public 
investment in Job Corps yields an even more substantial return to 
the government and to American taxpayers. The study found that 
for every dollar invested in Job Corps, a $1.46 is returned tc 
the public through increased taxes and reduced costs in crime, 
incarceration, and public assistance. 

Uob Corps has proven its commitment to our nation&apos;s 
disadvantaged youth and will continue make a difference in their 
lives and in the future success of our nation. I encourage you 
to consider all of its merits while examining the program&apos;s 
future .

time when the entire federal bureaucracy is undergoing an examination designed to majtc 
government work better and cost less, a review of Job Corps is certainly in order. 1 am writing 
today to make you awaie of my strong support for this valuable program. 

South Dakota has more than 17,000 rural youth living in poverty. The Box Elder Job Corps 
Civilian Conservation Center in Nemo, South Dakota is able to serve 200 of these at-risk youth 
each year. 

In your Committee&apos;s review of the statistical and anecdotal information relating to Job Corps, please 
keep in mind the unique population this program serves - severely disadvantaged youth who arc 
trying to break the cycle of poverty and welfare. Considering the group that it serves, it is 
important to note that over 70% of the young men and women who complete their Job Corps 
training cither go on to find paid employment, join the military, or attend further schooling - 
immediately contributing to the economic growth of our country. 

I have heard recent reports critical of certain Job Corps centers. Ii is my understanding that these 
concerns are being addressed. In the final analysis, if there are problem.&lt;; with Job Corps, let&apos;s fix 
them. However, let us not dismande a program that returns $1.46 for every doUar invested m it. 

While I am aware of and suppon the concept of streamlining the assortment of federal job training 
programs to make them more cost-effective, the successes of Job Corps should not be forgonen. 
This program has provided a viable alternative for our at-risk youth who may otherwise end up 
utilizing more costly options, such as welfare and incarceration. 

I look forward to working with you in an effon to make Job Corps an even more effective training 
program for our country&apos;s young people. 

With best wishes, I am

Dear Nancy, 

I am writing to you to express ray strong support of the Job 
Corps program. Job Corps io a unique and vital progran in our 
country. The comprah^naive group of services it presents to ac- 
riaJc youth are the only chance that many of them may have to 
develop a akill or find gainful employment. 

Over its thirty-year history, Job Corps has oarvad 1.6 
million individuale. Seven out of every ten graduates get jobs, 
enter the military or pursue further education. This ia a truly 
outstanding achievement vhen one coneidere that the average 
student is a high-school dropout, with low reading Bkllle, who 
has never held a full-time job.

Tha state of Michigan currently operates two Job Corpe 
Centers, with a third Blated to b« opened in Flint, MichigAr. in 
1996. Ae an indication of th« coiwnunity&apos; e commitment to thie 
program, over thirty local organizations have raised two million 
dollars in resourcea to help support the program.. Michigan, like 
many other states, has depressed communitieB struggling to 
produce and employ competent workers. Job Corps is one of the 
programs that many of these communitiee rely upon to meet that 
challenge. 

1 appreciate your effort to conduct oversight hearings on 
this effective program. It is Important that w« in Congress 
supervise programs like Job Corps to ensure that they are 
oroanised and operated ae efficiently as possible. I believe a 
fair and impartial look at the evidence will end up strengthening 
and supporting the Job Corpe program. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Madam Chainnan 

It has come to m&gt;&apos; attention that you will be holding oversight hearings on the Job 
Corps program later this month. I wanted to express my strong support for this program 
as a cost-effect ve investment in today&apos;s economically disadvantaged youtli 

The State of Louisiana has more than 156.000 povert\- youth. The Shreveport and 
New Orleans Job Corps centers have played an integral role m helping reduce the nnmbpr 
of poverty youth m the state In addition, the cines of New Orleans and Slueveport have 
benefited from tlie renovation, beautificanon and repair projects performed by the Job 
Corps smdents. 

As you review the statistical data available about Job Coips, take care not to lose 
Sight of pan of the program&apos;s onginal mtent -- to contribute to both immediate and long- 
term economic giowth. For those young men and women in the State of Louisiana who 
complete the program, and immediately go mto paid employment positions the return is 
self-evident. But, please consider diat tlie focus of Uic Job Corps program is as much 
about developing responsible, dependable, motivated and employable youth for tomorrow 
34 it IS about employing evers&apos; youth it graduates today I continue to bcHcvc such a 
rmssion is both insightful and forward thinking.

Senator Kassebaum. I am pleased of your interest in the Job Corps program and 
am confident that upon review, you will share, as I do. the hope for its continued 
contributions and success for our society and our country.

Dear Kadai! 



rman: 



I am writing to Express my strong support of the Job Corps 
program, which his brought hope, opportunity and empowerment to 
more than a million young people looking for a chance to prove 
themselves. I have always viewed Job Corpb as one of the federal 
government&apos;s most effective programs. It is amazing to note 
that, considering the population that it serves, 70% of all Job 
Corps participants get jobs, join the military or go on to 
further education. 

I am especially proud of the Job Corps in Hawaii, which has 
helped hundreds of at-risk youth gain necessary employment and 
life skills to help them succeed in the job market. The Hawaii 
Job Corps program is ranked second in the nation, and currently 
holds a rating at 13^.7% of the standard. 75.7% of students in 
the Hawaii program were verified as placed into jobs or full time 
further education upon completion of the program. If it were not 
for the Job Corps, many of these young people would hi^ve ended up 
dropping out of school, in detention homes, jail or even worse. 
Instead, they will become productive members of our community, 
contributing tax dollars to our economy. 

I appreciate your efforts to conduct oversight hearings on this 
program, and I know that you will take a fair and impartial look 
at all of the evidence presented before you. I also know that 
you will find thot Job Corps wcrks. 



I look forward to working with you to improve the best proyreim 
for at-risk youth our nation has to offer, the Job Corps.

Dear Madam Chairu-oman. 



I am wnting to express my support of the Job Corps program I believe in ihe Job Corps 
because it has helped bring hope, opportunity and empowerment to more than a million young 
people looking fo a chance to prove themselves 

The Job Corps program of Washington State has helped at-risk youth gain the necessary&apos; 
employment and life skills to help them succeed in the job market If it were no: for the Job 
Corps, many of these young people would have dropped out of school or ended up in detention 
homes or prison. Four centers in my state serve ovei 1,400 students each year, and offer a variety 
of occupational training. One of those facilities, the Cascade Job Corps Center, volunteered over 
3,000 hours of community service to the County last year 

I have aJways viewed the Job Corps as an effective program. 70% of all Job Corps 
participants find employment, join the military or further their education Additionally, modest 
investment in the Job Corps results in a return far more valuable than the dollars we put in the 
program-coiifidem young people poised to support themselves and their families and to 
contnbule to the overall productivity of our nation 

Madam Chairwoman, I appreciate your efforts to conduct oversight hearings on this 
effective program, and look forward to working with you to improve n great concept for our 
nation&apos;s at-nsk youth. Thank you for your consideration

Dear Madam Chairman.: 

I am writing to share with you my strong support for the Job 
corps program. I have always viewed Job Corps as one of the 
federal govermtiGnt &apos; s most effective programs, and I am pleased to 
know you will be conducting oversight hearings on the program in 
the near future.

Last September, a ribbon-cutting carsmony was held for the nev? 
Quentin Burdick Job Corps Center in Kinot, North Dakota. There 
is no question that this facility, like its fellow centers 
nationwide, will help a large number of at-risk youths gain the 
training and employment skills necessary to help them succeed in 
an increasingly competitive job market. Without the program, 
many of these young people could end up dropping out of school, 
being placed in detention centers or jail — or worse. 

I have witnessed first-hand how effective Job Corps is for North 
Dakotans , and I think the statistics are clear about its impact 
nationwide. As you are probably aware, approximately 7 percent 
of all Job Corps participants get jobs, join the military or go 
on to further their education. The average learning gains among 
Job Corps participants include a jump of 1.2 grade levels in 
reading and 2.2 grade levels in math. Job Corps students perforn 
an estimated S22 million worth of community project work annually 
as part of their training. And these numbers don&apos;t even begin to 
reflect the intangible benefits that Job Corps provides, such as 
instilling in participants a sense of self-respect, work ©thic , 
responsibility and self-sufficiency. 

The modest investment we make in Job corps results in a return 
that is far more valuable then the dollars initially put in the 
program. The role of Job Corps is particularly important as 
Congress begins to consider welfare reforms. According to the 
Child Welfare League, some 500,000 youth are in the child-welfare 
system, and at least 2 million families have become long-term 
users of AFDC benefits . Job Corps exemplifies the kind of 

education, training and support that is needed to help break the 
cycle of poverty -- the same cycle of poverty w&lt;? must confront as 
we debate how best to reform our welfare system. As such, I 
again applaud you for scheduling the forthcoming hearings . I am 
confident that any balanced analysis will further emphasize the 
effectiveness of the Job Corps program. 

I look forward to working with you to improve the best program 
for at-risk youth that our country has to offer.

Dear Madam Chairwoman: 

I am writing to express ray strong support for the Job Corps 
program. I believe m Job Corps because it has helped bring 
hope, opportunity and empowerment to more than a million young 
people seeking a chance to improve themselves. 

1 appreciate your decision to hold oversight hearings in an 
attempt to address some recent problems experienced by the Job 
Corps. Like you, I have been disturbed by reports of violence at 
Job Corps Centers. Violence cannot be tolerated at any level and 
this must be a clear mandate of the Job Corns. 



82 

I am proud to say that the Job Corps has been a success in 
California. Four of the five California Centers rank. :in the top 
21 of the 110 Centers in the nation for overall performance. Last 
year, 2,547 students part.l-cipated in the Job Corpe in California 
and more than 75% of therr. were placed in jobs, joined the 
military, or pursued further education, a rate higher than the 
national average. 

If it were not for the Job Corps, many o£ these young people 
wou.1d end up dropping out of school, m detention homee, jail or 
even worse. Additionally, the modest investment in Job Corps 
results in a return that is far more valuab.Te than the dollars we 
put in the program- confident young people poised tc support 
them.selves and their families and contribute to the overall 
productivity of our nation. 

I look forward tc working with you to improve one of the 
best programs for at-risk youth our nation has tc offer. Thank

THE MISSION OF JOB CORPS&apos; 



According to Public Law 97-300, Job Corps&apos; mission is: &quot;^ assist young individuals—to 
become more responsible, employable, and productive citizens_by providing the 
training and opportunitY to succeed.&quot; Job Corps serves disadvantaged young men and 
women ages 16 through 24 by providing them with the educational, vocational, and soaal 
skills needed to become productive, taxpaying citizens. 



FACTS ABOUT JOB CORPS PERFORMANCE 



WHAT DOES THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (OOL) MEAN BY JOB CORPS 
TERMINEE?&quot; 

The U.S. Department ot Labor (DOL) defines &quot;lermrnee&quot; as any student who enrolls in Job 
Corps, whether or not he/she graduates. A center termination does not mean that a student 
has been dismissed from a center; it simply means that the student has lett the center, either 
by completing the program and graduating, or by leaving prior to completion. 

HOW DOES DOL CALCULATE JOB CORPS&apos; PLACEMENT RATE? 

DOL counts as placements all students who are placed in jobs, further education, or the 
military. The placement rate is calculated by counting all students whose placement is verified 
by DOL through personal contact or paperwork, plus an estimated percentaj^e of those stu- 
dents who could not be tracked. DOL conservatively estimates that the percentage of non- 
trackable students that are placed is the same as the percentage ot students documented as 
placing themselves into |obs, further education, or the military. Employment may include 
temporary jobs, and education includes colleges, universities, trade schools, and other ad- 
vanced training programs. (Note: 41% ot Job Corps students are 16-17 years old, which 
limits the full range ot lobs available to them.) 

WHAT IS A JOB TRAINING MATCH? 

A |ob training match means that a Job Corps student has been placed in a )ob that exaaly 
matches his or her vocational training. 



WHAT IS AN EARLY DROPOUT? 

DOL defines an early dropout as a student who leaves Job Corps in less than 90 days. 

ARE JOB CORPS STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR CED? 

More than one-third of all Job Corps students are eligible for their GED. When students enroll 
in Job Corps they participate in standardized testing — the same exams used by most public 
schools - to determine if they are eligible for GED artainmenL Students may not be eligible 
for GED attainment if they arnve at Job Corps wrth a high school diploma, if they expenence 
significant language barriers, or if they have other serious learning obstacles. 

HOW IS A JOB CORPS STUDENT RATED A VOCATIONAL COMPLETER? 

Job Corps students who have achieved all skills listed in the Job Corps&apos; curriculum for their 
trade are considered vocational completers .

Senate labor and Human Resources Committee 
462 Dirksen Senate Office Building 
Washington, DC. 20510 

Dear Senator Simon: 

I am writing to express my strong support for the Job Corps 
Program. The International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, 
has been involved in Job Corps for more then 25 years. Dunng that 
time, thousands of young men and women, Youth at Risk, have gone 
through our Job Corps Painting, Glazing, Floor Covehng and Sign 
Industry Programs. Through the training and opportunities provided by 
Job Corps, these graduates have entered our apprenticeship programs 
to further hone their skills. There are numerous success stones of Job 
Corps graduates who have become journeymen in their trades, shop 
foreman, job supehntendents, contractors and union officers. 

Each year, Job Corps helps tens of thousands of young people 
to break the cycle of poverty and welfare dependance by providing the 
vocational training and job placement that young people need to 
become tax paying citizens. 

This week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee 
will be holding oversight heahngs on Job Corps. I hope, as a member 
of that committee, you will take an objective look at all of the data, not 
just concentrate on anecdotal presentations. After studying all of the 
facts, I am sure you will find that this modest investment in our 
nation&apos;s youth results in a return that is far more valuable than the 
dollars spent on the program. The bottom line is, Job Corps Works 
and Job Corps graduates are poised to support themselves and their 
families, and to conthbute to the overall productivity of this nation. 

If you need any additional information, please feel free to 
contact my office at 202/637-0720. 



Sincerely,

To U&gt;e Honorable Paul Simon: 



It has been Tri-State Beauty School&apos;s pleasure to vwwfc with the EJ Paso Job Corps lo tram K) 
students at a times since June 1991. When a student oraduated, me student was replaced so we 
usually had lOsUKlents enrolled. AH ttm students were hgh ris)( students. Many had no 
discipbne, parental guidance, or place to live From the day they entered school, we saw the 
difference in our usual high risk student. Job Corps studente were more highly niotjvated. 
generally easier to «N&gt;rk with, and their attendance was exceHem. They were constantly 
monttoted by Job Corps counselors, and if there was a problenn wtth the student, we were 
immediately assisted in solving it. 

Trt-State Beauty Schools in B Paso, Texas have been training students as cosmetologists 
since 1931. Most of our students receive Pell Grants, but Tri-State Beauty Sctiools give 
instilutionai grants, or loans, to the students instead of relying on Federal loans. We were once 
one of tt&gt;e institutions with high default. However, we have reduced the default to % with one 
servicer, and to 20% with another servicer for the past year. 

Every single student «Aio graduated from Tri-State Beauty School and who was an El Paso 
Job Corp resident, has a job In the cosmetology inoustry. 

I teatfier Oilmor« t» the proprietor of a salon, wtiich wt» iiBtHlKxt tqr her grandmother. Ana 
Vargas, Angle Mendoza and Norma Borunda, all Job Corps graduates, have a jointty owned 
shop. 

Sonia Lopez had been consistently toM by her mother she would never achieve anythirtg. The 
day she received t&gt;er diploma, she ran to take it to her mottier, proving she was able to achlevel 
She has a job m cosmetology. 

All these cosmetologists are paying their way in society, and we befieve that their stories wouU 
have been different if they had not been enroHed In El Psso Jobs Corps and then sent to Tri- 
State for job training. 

We have worked «wth many state and federal agencies for many years. I have never««rt(ed 
with an agency, either state or federal, which has had a more consistent manner of handling 
clients or a better achievement record. 

El Paso Job Corps fills a vital need in this community, which is one of the cities in the United 
States most depressed economically. We will appreciate your considerabon of this agency.

Dear Senator Kassebaum: 

As Governor of Iowa, I am writing you to encovirage the continued 
support for the Job Corp 50/50 Plan. 

I have visited the Denison Job Corp Center on many occasions and 
we are pleased and proud of the positive results produced by this 
center. The very capable staff is offering training for at-risk 
youth throughout the Midwest. They have an outstanding program 
for single parents, which provides on site living facilities and 
day care while the students are receiving an education and job 
training. 



88 

If we are going to break the cycle of poverty, crime, and 
unemployment, how better can we do it than by providing training 
and educational opportunities for these hard to place young 
people. Not only do they learn job skills, they are also learning 
the value of community service (putting something back into 
society). They are involved in many community service projects 
in the Denison area which give them worthwhile experience in a 
wide variety of fields, plus a sense of belonging to the 
ccMnmunity. 

The Denison Job Corp Center serves an average of 500 students per 
year. And, this site is the number One center in the nation for 
placement of its students. 

I strongly encourage you to continue this valuable program. 

Sincerely,

Dear Senator Harkin, 

My name is Teresa Drummond, and I am a student at the Denison Job Corp Center I want 
to tell you the story of my life, how I came to be a student here, and what it has done for me 

I was born to a low-income single parent home, which put me at a disadvantage to other 
children 1 had the potential to succeed, but was never given the opponunitv to show mv talents and 
abilities Never the less, there was a problem side to me as well My mother had difficulties raising 
me, and when I was in my early teens I was placed m a group care facilit\ To say the least, I was 
far from being an angel 

When I was sixteen years old. 1 decided that I wanted to do something in life I wanted to 
be somebody I went into the Independent Living Program, sconng the highest in Iowa on the 
evaluation Every month. I received a check from the state which enabled me to stay in school I 
was an honor student who was enthused with learning Everything was going as well as could be 
expected 1 was working and making more than minimum wage, which is not bad for a high school 
student 

V/hen 1 was a senior in high school. 1 turned 18 years old This meant that I would no longer 
receive checks for being a child of the state Paying bills on time became difficult, and 1 had to start 
working extra hours This caused me to miss a great deal of school In the midst of everything, I was 
dropped from school a month and a half before graduation 1 really couldn&apos;t afford it, but 1 took the 
day off from work to go to the graduation ceremony for the class of &quot;1994&quot; 1 sat up in the bleachers, 
watching my fnends go up for their diplomas ] was fine until thev came to where I would have been 
standing, had I completed I burst into tears There was nothing 1 could do to stop the hurt and the 
disappointment 1 was feeling All the nights I had stayed up studying, the events 1 had missed, and 
the fijn I could have had. if only there weren&apos;t a test the next day These things seemed as if they were 
for nothing They no longer had any meaning 

I lost hope in everything 1 had ever believed in 1 thought that I could never be successful at 
anything, and no one tried to change my mind or tell me different I pawned off everything I owned 
just to make my rent pavment Things just seemed to be getting worse and worse Then they didn&apos;t 
just seem that way. they were Within a month. I was living on the streets Sleeping where ever 1 
ended up at night I registered at the local Human Services for food stamps and Title XIV My 
friends were having troubles with money as well, so I could not ask them for help I didn&apos;t talk to my 
family much any more, and 1 wasn&apos;t so sure that they would help me anvovaN Towards the end I 
resorted to staying in an abandoned van behind m\&apos; friends apartment 

When I was in group care. 1 had heard of a place called Job Corp After hearing about it, I 
never thought an\lhing more about it A concerned friend of mine informed me about a crisis center 
in mv home town Come to find out later, 1 had lived there as a child with my mother I had been 
living there nearlv a week when 1 came across a pamphlet on Job Corp I dialed the number for the 
hotline on the back, and they put me in contact with a screener Her name was Cindy Swan, and she 
was happy to help me out 

Mv time had run out at the crisis center and 1 had no where to go A week later I met with 
Cindy and she helped me get fijnding ft-om the Human Resources office to stay in a hotel until I could 
get into an orientation group Within a couple of days I received a call from Cindy She had gotten 
me bumped up on the waiting list, and they had an opening for me 1 would be leaving within a few 
davs or so 



90 

Thai next 7 uesday I boarded a Greyhound bus that would take me to stan the betiinniny of 
my neu life I amved in Denison. Iowa at 8 45 p ni on June 21.1 994 with nearl\ twenty others w ho 
had no idea what lay aliead of them As we drove up the long curv&gt;- drive way. fear rose in me 1 
had no idea what to expect The bus stopped at the top of the iiili and let everyone out There were 
several students there to meet us We entered the orientation room, and we were greeted by the 
instructor who did her best to show us that we were welcome The first couple of weeks were tough, 
but we managed to make it through 

If I had only known what this place could do for a person, 1 would have been here long before 
now I am trving to make a life for myself The skills that I learn here will always be with me That&apos;s 
something that can never be taken away from me I have been here for nearly seven months now 
It has not been eas\&apos; There have been several times that 1 have wanted to leave, but I knew that if 
I stayed, things would get better Leaving would simply ha\ e been the wrong solution to a simple 
problem 

In the time that 1 have been a Job Corp student, I ha\ e succeeded in doing many things in 
September of 1994, 1 received my G ED , my High School Diploma, and my Certified Nurses Aide 
Recently, in December of 1994, 1 earned my Home Health Aide certification A am currently a 
Business&amp;Clerical student and a part-time college student I am enrolled in the Arts&amp;. Sciences 
program at Western Iowa Tech with hopes of starting the Licensed Practical Nursing program in 
August. Even after I venture away from Job Corp, 1 plan on fijrthenng my education in the field of 
pediatrics 

I owe mv success to the staff and students at Job Corp Without them I would never have 
been able to put on that cap and gown that I worked so hard for in high school With their help I&apos;ve 
nearly touched the stars All of my dreams for the future are slowly becoming reality 1 now know 
that i can be successful and that I can do anything that I set mv mind to Job Corp has made me a 
better person It is shaping the person that I will be in the future Not only am 1 well educated, but 
that 1 can be successful and that I can do anything that I set my mind to Job Corp has made me a 
better person It is shaping the person that 1 will be in the future Not only am I well educated, but 
I have the social skills to make it in life I hope that others can come to find what I have found in this 
program It&apos;s not something that is just given to you, you have to set your sights and go after it. 
Now, not only do I have the potential to succeed, I&apos;ve been given the opportunity to succeed, and I 
have. 

I truly believe, that if I had not come to Job Corp. that eventually I would have been living 
off of welfare with a dead end job, perhaps I would have been li\ing back on the streets That ver\ 
well could have been my fate It just goes to show that you can change your destiny I will never 
lose hope again, because 1 now know that ever\thing that lies in my future, is up to me I have the 
power to be anyihing that 1 want to be 

1 want to thank you for your time, and giving me the chance to tell you what Job Corp has 
done for my life 

Sincerely,

How Job Corps Changed My life&apos;! 

B\ M.iritniiiL. Kibbitf 



Before 1 came to Job Corpo, I had problems with m&gt;&apos; family and 1 was stealmg from m}- 
parents Then I was socially melesied by m}&apos; uncle, so my parents and 1 decided to find a soiutiou 
to tiie problenu, Tliat&apos;s when I heard about Job Corps. 

We contacted the screener in m}&quot; area ot&apos;centitil lowia, and \\e had an mte^^^e\^■ with hnn. 
He asked nie some questions !ii:e &quot;How did 1 hear about Job Corps&apos;?&quot; I said my hiah school 
counselor liad told me alxiut the ludi sclux)! diploma class here so 1 said &quot;Let&apos;s go tor it &quot; So 1 
entered the Job Corps program on July 5, 1994, 

Then I tal};ed with Mrs. Phyllis Harms, the high school diploma msmjctor, about getmig 
in to Higli School Diplouj-\ ClaiS. Tlit;\ kid to oixler iny u-auiciipli.. liicn waii lo gei my 
trauscripls back before I could gel in. Now I am in High School Diploma clss and I am doing 
very well in there, even passing the tesli in my classes. I have seven more credits left then I will 
gel high school diploma. 

I w ant to complet my training hei-e in Deniiion Job Corps then go on to Excelsior Springs 
Job Corps in Missouri for more extensive trailing in business. 

The teachers here are veiy nice to me, especially one of the teachers, Mrs. Jud&gt;&apos; Jepsoii, 
who kind of adopted me as her daughter. I even have a step Grandpa out here ao Job Corps. His 
name if Mr. Ike Johnson; he is %ny cool. Even the RA&apos;s arc nice to me, espcialh&apos; Sheila Reitan, 
Linda Blum, Diane Littleton, and Linda Bnnk. lliey axe like moms also to me. Even the C-2 
dorm ladies, especially Kanie Weaver, Stacie HalL and Kathie Donahue are good friends and 
siste:s. 

My other responsibilities and duties are Bigs Sister and Brother, Lmen Monitor and Rec 
Aide. 

I am glad that we get ftee medical, dental, food, and housing pro-vided Wc e\-en gel paid 
like in the real world. 

The center is a perfect pLice fcu&quot; people who are having probiems in the faiiiil} and sdjt\&gt;:. 
Even if you have lo leave brothers and sisters behind that goes craz&gt;- then they are around you. 

Job Corps is a good place to go and improve yourself. The teachers here help you figure 
out 3&apos;our problems and e\eu the RA&apos;s help me wth mj&apos; homework when 1 need it. The old sa3&apos;iug 
&quot;You can leam a lot when ^-ou put }-our mind to it&quot; is true. Job Corps helps me get on with m}&apos; life 
instead of dependuig on my parents. Job Corps will help me get an educahon and job were I can 
support myseh&apos;in the future uiilioui depending on my parents or socien- for sudstauce. 



How Job Cof-ps Changc&apos;d My Life 
by Maridy Wsber 

before I c£ir::e to Job Corps I was living at, my frierds 
hou3&apos;i-. I slept on the cou:rh. I Ki-.fe ori food stamps arid no* 
rettinr; i&gt;long with iu&gt;p-xrentz very i-,ell. 

t&apos;lv r.other told r,i=- eiboLit Job Corps and the benefits it

ce-.ial car-£, anH they pay yoM every two weeks. They also

neec;. 



92 

I&apos;ve t-sic-r, hii-rt-- rcr s. ye^ar and I coulcin&apos;t have made a 
better choicti, I&apos;ve made lobs of friends and I&apos;ve had more 
responsibility than I ever did at home. I&apos;m on the BIGS and 
I enjoy that because I help people get to know the place 
better. I-ve been on Dorm Government, but I resigned to 
focus on my high school diploma and my trade. 

I&apos;m m the Security trade and I love what I do. I 
basically do security skills books and we do cross walk duty 
at the elementary school in Denison. The Security students 
do campus patrol, fire drills and fire Marshall reports. fis 
futurt- Security guards, we do physical training , watch 
videotapes on what to look for on the job sight where you 
would work. 

U&apos;.TC-n I get out I want to go into the United States 
Coast Guards. There i want to be trained in Maritime law 
enforcement. fifter boot camp, I would like to be sent to 
Corpus Chrir.ti, Texas. When I finish rny tour of duty in the 
C.03.&apos;j,t Guards, I would like to be a guard in the prisori 
systisr.i. 

If I say anything to Ar\yorie who c£&lt;n&apos; t afford college or 
is halving trouble? getting through high school and who meets 
tl.e age qualifications of sixteen tc&apos; twenty-four years; I 
would suggest Job Corps. I think it&apos;s a good program with 
lots of benefits to it. It is worth being here for as long 
as it tal-.ef you to complete. filso life is too short to come 
to wasttv. If you have a charice to come to Job Corps, take 
it. It riiay bi the birgr&gt;3t step in your life srid one of the 
Stuart est ones too. 



How Job Cor, .5 Changed My Life 
by Jean finn Rogers 

I have been in Job Corps for three months. Job Corps 
has changs&apos;d my life abound all tri^- way. Job Corps gave me a 
secure place to stay. Wr.sr, I was back home I was in end out 
or foster hc^mes for about t&apos;.-:z&gt;anci a half yearns. I lived in 
several foster homes, nsvtr liviv^g i ri any of then for mor&apos;e 
than six monthis. Just b-^fors I camt? to Job Corps I was 
living with a friend in an Apert merit beciiust.- 3 was kicKCd 
out of my mother&apos;s for hantjinr; out witti the &quot;wr~ong CT&apos;cwd.&quot; 

Job Corps is giving me sc&apos;r.ie training skills as rny trads 
is Health Occupations. In Hec.lth Occupations we study the 
body parts, how to make occupied beds and how to bathe the 
patients. I r. order to become a Cer&apos;;ified Nur-ses Aid you 
must be able to pass the states board test. When you iu-e 
halfway through the training you will learri tiow to take cetr^e 
of patients. With all the training I have, I hope I will be 
able to become a Registered Nurse sometime. 

Job Corps has also taught me how to learn 
responsibility. Back home I rie\/er had any responsibilities. 
But when I came to Job Corps I had to do chores as part of 
the dorm living arrangement. Every morning we have to get 
up and clear, our rooms and do the dorm duties so the whole 
dot&apos;w will be clean. Everyday we get graded on the areas 
and rooms and if any rooms or areas fail the people in the 
room or the people ori the: crew havc? to do the scrub club foy^ 
one hour. 

Job Corps has also taught me hCiVJ to handle money. When 
I was back heme I thought I should have money everyday. But 
since I have btien up here I learned money doesn&apos; t grow on 
trees. Job Corps pays us »££. 00 dollars every two weeks. 
So basically when you av^e out of money you have to wait 
until the next payday. Also up here we have a bank i ri case 
you want to deposit money. But you do rieed to tell the bank 
the night befcre; if you want moru- than ?.£5. 00 dollars out. 



93 

Job Corpz is also helping mi:&gt;gei £i high school diploma 
becai.ise I quib school my jui-iio- year. I had a lot of 
problems I didn&apos;i, thinW. I could handle on my own. Then one 
afternoon, Job Services cr.lled and asked me if I was • 
interested in going back to school. I said yes, because 
while 1 was at home, I Juc!; sao around and thought to myself 
tf.at I would like to complete:- my education. 

Job Corps gave me a lot to look at because in Marshall 
evcrythif.g vjas negative. I thought there was no life out 
tiiKrii&apos; for r. :■ bi.;t since I ca::&quot;&lt;i to Jc&apos;:.. CJorp-ii, they sriov.cci mc? 
tha: I i-.ou:,i like to do sor-.st!-, inr with my lift;-.&apos; 

So if T knov-; anyone whO&apos; quits school I will sugrest Job 
Corpr, to thu.^ih hscause- it is i. nr^-at place&apos; 



How Job Coi~p Changed My Life 
by Kendra Mallek 

Jc&apos;b Corpc has changed my life in many ways. 1 would 
say that the biggest change Job Corps has made has been in 
r.iy attitude. Without a positive attiti.ide you will not make 
1 I f ar^ in lift. 

before I came to Job Corp^-, I didn&apos;t have any plans for 
the future and I didri&apos;t care. I am only sixteen years old 
arid alre£iriy have my life plarriec out. Since I&apos;ve been at 
Job Corps I have completed Security. 

I am working ori riiy high school diploma and hope to have 
it by the end of Ppt&apos;il. I didn&apos;t d&apos;O so well in high school 
when I was at home, sc&apos; I catiis to Job Corps with very few 
credits. But I believe if I put my r.;ind to it I cari 
accomplish anything. 

I am very tharikful to certain staff members for being 
so supportive and for helping me get past my problems and 
getting on with more important things in life. 

The best thing Job Corps is giving me is the training 
and education I will need to support my child that is on the 
way. 

I have so many things to be thankful for and the most 
important thing is Job Corps. It has changed my life for 
the better in my way. 

I believe you get what you want out of life. If you 
C&apos;i&apos;;i-:i- to a Job Co-&apos;ps with a bad attitude and start causing 
trouble, don&apos;t think that your education is just going to be 
handed to you. Cm the cither hand, if you come- to Job Corps 
with a positive attitude and the strength to overcome 
obstacles, you can&amp;r\d will get what you came for-. 

Everyone doesn&apos;t like the rules, but Job Corps is just 
preparing you for the real w.orld.

and stabh&apos;eu n- ice. V^&apos;hen I got to Job Corps the staff took a gemiine concern for my well fair the}&apos; 
welcome me and got me wright in my trade. I have met many people at Job Corps and have changed 
considerabh&apos; since I first enter Job Corps. Job Corps had also mabiiing me to pers&apos;jaded my high

people uho would be in jail if tlic}- where not at Job Corps. 

It cost a lot more to seivj a kid to Jixi Coips tlian to send a person to jail for a year. Job Corps

How Job Corp Changed My Life 
by Todd Alan Dumdei 

On October 5, 1993, a struggling young man drove to Ida Grove 
to talk to an older gentleman about changing his life and goals. 
This older man, whom I will call Alex, told the younger man about 
making a wounderous new life and a better future for himself. Alex 
told me about Job Corps and the chance it gives almost everyone. 
I asked alot of questions about Job Corps because I had heard all 



101 

kinds of stories about the place. Alex did not pull any punches. 
He was straight forward and confirmed a few of the stories. Most 
of them were wrong. I was still unsure about Job Corps, but still 
decided to go and try to accomplish something other than working 
deadend jobs. 

Alex called me on October 13th and told me that the date was 
set and the staff would be waiting for me on the 19th. I got 
nervous and asked if he could start me at a later time. Alex told 
me that he could give me a week longer. But, in order for me to be 
able to change my life I would need to stop stalling. I called Job 
Corps and told them I would be ready on the 19th. The next day I 
was fired from my job and a week later my car was reposessed by my 
bank. My life was getting more messed up by the minute. The only 
thing I had to look forward to now was Job Corps. 

A van pulled up outside my house and a strange man walked up 
the sidewalk. I knew he was the driver, somehow. I loaded my bag 
in the backseat, climed in front, put my seat belt on and soon fell 
asleep. While we were driving up the hill to the Denison Job Corps 
I read the signs. They offered me some comfort. Here&apos;s what they 
said: 

You Have Now Entered, 

Where Dreams Become True. 

For At This Center, 

Life Begins Anew. 

The Skills You Gain, 

Will Always Remain, 

No Matter Where Your Domain. 

WELCOME DENISON JOB CORPS CENTER 

When we reached the Orientation building my &quot;Big Brother&quot; was 
there waiting for me. He introduced himself as Jeremy. He helped 
me carry my bags to the Orientation room and on to dorm as soon as 
all the necessary paperwork was done. Jeremy showed me around the 
campus for a while then we went to the cafeteria. I was really 
scared being around all of these new people and didn&apos;t eat much. 
Later on that night, I was able to meet all of the people on dorm. 
I was starting to relax a little and after roll call I went to my 
room and went to sleep. My week in Orientation was fun and very 
informative. I was starting to feel a lot more welcome. 

As I finished Orientation and starting OEP, I was making more 
friends than I ever had in my home town. OEP, which stands for 
Occupational Exploration Program, helped me decide which carrer I 
wanted. I was also shown how to set goals and meet them. After 
just two weeks at Job Corps, I was starting to feel good about 
myself and my future. As I started my trade and academic classes, 
I felt myself gaining self-esteem and pride. I was accomplishing 
something for a change instead of just giving up and running away 
from my problems. 

After a few months, I started getting a little stressed out 
and fell back to what I used to be. I stole a pool stick and I got 
caught. The staff that delt with me were fair in my punishment. 
I asked if I could see the center Mental Health doctor. I was put 
on medication for my stress and learned from a friend about a 
relaxation technique. After about four more months, I was doing 
better so I was put on two different types of medication. I think 
I was allergic to one of the medications because that next day I 
went into extreme depression and I ran from the center to try to 
kill myself. I was found walking and taken to the town hospital 
v;here I requested mental treatment. I was taken to Cherokee Mental 
Hospital where I received the treatment I needed. 



102 

After I was released, I was put on medical leave for a month. 
When I came back I was greeted by all of my friends. I was very 
happy I was allowed to come back and I thanked all of my friends 
for being there when I needed them. I also apologized to them for 
putting them through the pain and sorrow when I left. I still feel 
bad for not being able to say good-bye to some of my friends who 
left before I got back. However, I feel we will all meet some day 
in the future. 

Now, a year and three months after my first day, I have 
completed my trade and am starting pre-employment training. I now 
have the future I didn&apos;t have before. I am proud to be a Job Corps 
student and I will encourage other people who are needing guidance 
in their lives to go to Job Corps and get the training they need 
for a brighter tomorrow. 

I am finally able to say I finished something that will make 
me a better person. 



HOU&apos; JOB CORPS CHANGED MY LIFE! 

BY AM&apos;^JDA r:. WAGONER 

January 11, 1995 



When 1 entered Job Corps on June 21, 199i, I had only been 
out of college for a month and a half and I still was having a 
difficult time finding a job to support myself. I was living on 
my own for three years and only fifteen miles away from my parents 
for whom were still supporting me before coming here. 

As I was coming up the drive in a very cramped, packed bus 
of bags and about 30 some kids, including myself, I saw about 7 
to 8 signs spread a part from each other and each one read a 
different phrase: 

YOU HAVE NOW ENTERED 

WHERE DREAMS BECOME TRUE. 

FOR AT THIS CENTER 

LIFE BEGINS ANEW. 

THE SKILLS YOU GAIN 

WILL ALWAYS REMAIN 

NO&gt;LATTER ^JHERE YOUR DOMAIN. 

WELCOME DENISON JOB CORPS CENTER. 

At first when I read that I thought &quot;Yeah right. I may have 
entered, I&apos;m not going to stay because my dreams have never became 
true.&quot; After reading all of those signs, I had yet another thought. 

My other thought was after getting to Job Corps is that if 
three years of college and two credits short of getting a college 
diploma didn&apos;t work for me, Job Corps certainly wouldn&apos;t work for 
me either. As you can now see, I didn&apos;t quit no matter how much 
I wanted too and I am still here. 

In my own opinion before Job Corps, 1 just wasn&apos;t getting 
anywhere with my life. I really thought my future was bleak 
because of the way I was treated by other kids from my younger 
years of elementary, junior high, and high school grades. 

With me having a learning disability, I thought I would never 
graduate from high school. Eventually, I thought I would hi&gt;ve gotten 
a lousy job that 1 would be stuck with for the rest of my life that 
I may not like nor would want for the rest of my life. 



103 

Now that I&apos;m in Job Corps, I&apos;m getting even closer to being a 
step off completer in my trade. I guess you can say, 1 made a good 
choice in staying. Once 1 have completed that step off level, I 
will have a better chance of getting a good job that I would like 
rather than getting a job that only requires you to have a high 
school diploma for which I already required on June 1, L991. 

I would like to say I&apos;ve had some help from some fellow 
students, teachers, residential advisors, and all other staff 
members, past and present, to get where I am at now. 1 know 1 did 

the work myself but I&apos;ve had their help on understanding what I&apos;m 
working on now and what I have worked on in the past since I&apos;ve 
entered Job Corps. Without their help, I don&apos;t know where I would 
be now. 

By doing what I&apos;m doing now in Job Corps, I have changed in 
many ways that I can&apos;t think of or could have imagined on changing 
if I was still going to college back home right now instead of being 
here. Since being here, I have become a part of the Big Brother/ 
Big Sister Program, a Dorm Aide at one time, a Dorm Government 
Officer position of Chief Justice, and a Recreation Aide. 

After I am completed with Job Corps, I&apos;m thinking of going 
back to college at home to complete the two credits I need for the 
college diploma in Office Technology. Maybe this time, I&apos;ll have 
a better time at adjusting to going to college. 

All in all, I think Job Corps is a good place to go to for a 

very good education and the training you will need for the future. 

Job Corps can change a person&apos;s attitude on life. Please give it 
a try. 

Have a HEART and the S.P.I.R.I.T. to go for it in Job Corps 
anywhere here in the United States. 

KOVv JOB CORPS CHANGED MY LIFE 
By Stacie Hall 

I dropped out of high school to be with my older friends that 
had already graduated. If I went to school I missed out on all the 
fun with them. Drugs and alcohol became a big part of my life. In 
fact it pretty much took over. At that time I left home, thinking 
I would do 3ust fine on my own. 

I moved around from here to there living with friends; eating 
their food and using what little money my family gave me for drugs 
and alcohol. I never asked them for much because I had my pride and 
didn&apos;t want to admit I was wrong. I still did not have a job. 

I finally got a 30b in my hometown and stared working. Drugs 
and alcohol were still a big part of my life, and because of that I 
lost my job and my apartment; which meant once again I was letting 
my family down. 

I went through two more jobs, still living with friends, before 
I found a job that I really liked. I got my own apartment and found 
a roommate. I had all the training I needed for the job, but because 
it was a small business, the pay was very low. I barley made enough 
money to live, even with a roommate to split the bills with. My drug 
addiction was taking up all the money I had. 



104 

Then one day I was watching television and I saw a commercial 
about Job Corps. It was then I decided I was sick of living the 
way I was; dodging my family because I was embarrassed to how my 
face because I was a loser. I wanted to get job training, get a job, 
and live like normal people. I wanted off welfare. I wanted to make 
something of myself. I wanted to amke my family proud of me. I wan- 
ted to make my mom and dad so proud of me that they would say, she&apos;s 
finally getting it together. 

Job Corps was my last chance. If it weren&apos;t for this program 
I&apos;d still be in my apartment getting high and drunk, hopin I would 

work the next day do I would have enough money to get food. 

If you were to close down the Job Corps Centers, think about 
all of the people that are just like me. The ones that wouldn&apos;t 
get a chance to make their life better. Some people want to straigh- 
ten their life out but can&apos;t because of money or other things. Job 
Corps is the answer to their prayers. 

I&apos;ve been here 7 months now. Its changed my life. I haven&apos;t 
done any drugs since I walked on center and I haven&apos;t drank for four 
months. Since I&apos;ve gotten here I&apos;ve earned my High School Diploma. 
I plan on going to college once I complete my trade and get as much 
education as I can. There have been rough times, and I&apos;ve wanted to 
leave but thanks to the support of my friends and the staff I&apos;ve made 
it through. I want to be somebody, not a nobody. Thanks to Job Corps 
I well be somebody someday. 



How Job Corp Changed My Life 
by Marco Hogue 



Before I entered Job Corps I was seventeen years old living in 
East St. Louis as a young teenager out on the streets parting, in 
a gang and sellling crack doing all the bad things a teenager would 
do. 

One day in a shoot out my cousin got shot standing next to me, 
and died. Right then and there I realized that could have been me. 
I told my dad and he worked with me and said, &quot;Son, you need to 
leave this town and make something out of yourself besides this 
surrounding here.&quot; 

Three days passed, he suggested Job Corps, that&apos;s when I got 
signed up at Mingo Job Corps. That&apos;s where I had a chance to get 
a fresh new start with my life, and a change- 

The first day I met new people, and a friend. It took me five 
months to get adjusted to the place and straighten up, also a 
chance to leave my thug life behind. There were rules for me to 
follow, I learned a lot about discipline . I also learned about 
people and how to deal with them on center and off. 



105 

Thanks to the training of social skills, when it was first put 
out to be a learning subject for the Job Corps system. This was a 
part of my life that I took serious, this is when I matured, by 
eighteen I felt like I was twenty- three. 

Thanks again for the Job Corps system for the good things they 
have to offer for the young and older students. As well for the 
training to a forest fighter on the side, beside your trade of 
choice to make extra money. 

I also learned C.P.R., and I was trained to be a Cormen 
leader, which I thought was great. This charged my point of view 
about life, that I can be somebody. I also completed and recieved 
a certificate in Culinary Arts, this is when I ran for Vice 
President of the center and won. 

The best part is that I had the chance to travel, and visit 
other Job Corps Centers, as well as meeting new people. I&apos;m only 
human, I had some bad times and some good times at Job Corps. Most 
importantly the people at Job Corps that care about the students 
here, that helps a lot, with any problem. 

Peer Counseling was an important part of my life on center is 
helping out the students with their problems and concerns that make 
me feel good. 

Me, myself, and I can be devoted to the Job Corps system. 
That&apos;s one of the reasons why I came to back to Job Corps to 
Denison to get my G.E.D. and meet more people and give lots of 
ideas to make this center a better place to work and live. 

Needless to say I had to leave Mingo to take care of my sick 
Grandmother, but now I&apos;m back and going all the way to the top of 
my goals, instead of one step away. 

Then I want to help Denison out as much as possible by giving 
them more and more of the ideas to make and improve this center so 
everyone could be happy. 

That is the reason why I&apos;m running for President for Executive 
Council. Hopefully in my future I will be a part of the Job Corps 
Center, by starting out as a Center Standard Officer. 



HOW JOB CORPS CHANGED MY LIFE 
by William Thompson 



Before I came to Job Corps, my life was shattered. I started going down hill at the age of 
nine. It got worse through the years 

My parents fought with me every day to go to school I never liked school from the third 
grade on, but it was in the sixth grade when I rumed it for myself I started doing drugs and 
alcohol. 

One morning my mom told me to get up for school and I swore and threw an ashtray at 
her. She picked up a belt and was going to spank me, and 1 grabbed a knife and told her if she 
came near me 1 would kill her My dad came hoe that morning and made me go to school. I got 
kicked out of school the same day for fighting with a student. 

Later that day mo took me to see a psychiatrist. That very day I was admitted into the 
psychiatric care unit at Marian Health. I was in different lock-ups during the next five years 



106 

My teenage years were in nut wards and I had only myself to thank for it All I did was 
fight and lose control When one place would get sick of my behavior they would ship me to 
another Even in the placements when they tried to get me to do school work I would throw it at 
them and tell them to do it themselves I got treated fair in some placements and unfair in others. 

Finally at the age of sixteen I got to go home I found out how precious life and freedom 
was to me But my attitude never changed My parents and I fought even worse I got more and 
more into drugs and alcohol I would go to school for a month or two and quit That was my 
pattern until I was eighteen lucky for me I worked good enough to pass. 

As soon as I turned eighteen my attitude changed a little The fighting slowed down a 
little between my parents and I They didn&apos;t like me doing drugs, but they knew they couldn&apos;t stop 
me. I was never at home that year. Instead i was out partying and getting into illegal activities. 

There was one person that would not give up on me, my English teacher from East High 
School he came out to the house quite often tr&gt;&apos;ing to get me to sign up for Job Corps Even&apos; 
time he left I threw the papers away and said I didn&apos;t need Job Corps Then one day he came 
over, discussed Job Corps with me, and said if 1 fail to sign up this time he would never ask me 
again He told me 1 was ruining my life by not working or finishing my education Well, for a 
year and a half after that I still thought he didn&apos;t know me or what he was talking about • 

Then it happened, mom told me that because I had no job or intention of going back to 
school I had to move out So I moved onto a farm with a friend of my dads 

That is when 1 realized how bad my situation really was. I kept thinking how I had let my 
parents and myself down, I knew at that moment I wasn&apos;t going anywhere in life. I couldn&apos;t get 
any of it out of my mind. So I went back to my parents and asked if they would take me sign up 
for Job Corps They thought I was joking or trying to pull one over on them But my dad took 
me to a Job Corps screener before I changed my mind I thank God he did because once 1 signed 
up I wondered if I had made the right choice 

It was awhile before I got my invitation letter But in between time. I kept thinking maybe 
I did something that I was going to regret after I got there I thought 1 would be there a week 
and would quit My parents and relatives &quot;gave me two weeks&quot; and said I would quit 

I&apos;ve been here almost seven months and I am very proud of myself I am more proud of 
myself than I have ever been in my life I have earned my G.E.D so far and hopefully my high 
school diploma in time I have done some of the most unbelievable things here I am proud to be 
president of the chess club and wing leader of my dorm 1 push myself in spons to do the best I 
can and to get trophies or awards I have already won three and I&apos;m going for them all 1 am 
proud of my certiftcates of completion in the classes I&apos;ve completed I&apos;ve never felt so good about 
myself as the way this place makes me feel 

Maybe I&apos;ve never been off drugs long enough to know what it feels like I have shocked 
my parents and relatives. Now when 1 go home, they always tell me good things that 1 haven&apos;t 
heard since I was a kid I try to be more responsible than 1 was 1 look back at my past and thin 
why did that have to be me 

Since 1 have been at Job Corps, I have seen a different future for myself one that really is 
there if I want it bad enough There&apos;s no way I could throw my last chance of making something 
of myself away I plan to get my diploma and finish a trade or two, or three. I&apos;ll do anything 1 can 
to change my life and build my relationship with my family again before I lose them I almost 
blew up and got terminated, but I handled it better than 1 have ever done in my life I know it&apos;s 
because I&apos;ve never been this far, and I&apos;m never going back Job Corps has changed my life in ways 
I&apos;ve never imagined. And I know if I can do it anyone can They just need to wake up the way I 
did, hopefully sooner

Tc whom it mav concern, 



This letter is to inform you of Che concern existing about the 
need of Job Corps Centers nation wide. 

As you know, since its beginning. Job Corps has been helping 
kids by offering vocational training such as Health Occupations 
and Business Clerical, techinical training such as building 
trades or welding with the option of . Union benefits, or college 
courses and advanced training for completers. Plus, Job Corps 
offers a high school diploma and/or GED program for those stu- 
dents who have come into the program without finishing high 
school. 

The after-school activities are just as numerous as Che voca- 
tional choices with a recreational hall, art room, and a gym. 
The rec hall also funds trips to rec and fitness centers, 
movies, concerts, and sporting events. 

In a perfect world, Job Corps would not be necessary, teenagers 
would stay out of trouble, and the government would make all 
the right choices. 

Unfortunately, as we all know, this is not a perfect world. 
Job Corps is necessary not only for troubled teenagers but 
those without a last chance, like me. 

If you vote against Job Corps in February you will cake away 
that last chance that many of the A0,000 students currently 
enrolled in the Job Corps program have, not Co mention the 
countless others awaiting enrollment into this vital program. 

I am Kim Wingace and have been in Job Corps since June 15, 1993. 
The program has given me a chance for a fuCure. I now have 
plans for a job, a place to live, and enough readjustment to 
get off to a good stare once I&apos;ve compleCed my trade. 

Please Cake anocher look ac Job Corps and consider what may 
happen to our society if it doesn&apos;t continue Co exisc before 
you make your final decision. 

Thank you for your cime, 

Sincerly ,

How Job Corps changed my life 



As a scudenc of Job Corps 1 think that I can truthfully speak 
for how much Job corps can really help people Chat need it. 
Before I came, I had made so many plans for my future, but none of them 
fell Chrough for me. Maybe because I didn&apos;t have my G.E.D, Driver&apos;s 
license, or any money at all for college. 

But if people would just stop and think about what this place 
offers, they would realize chac it truely benefits them. But most 
people come here thinking more of a social life than anything, and 
don&apos;t even take into consideration all the opportunities that Job Corps 
has to offer. 

I&apos;m not saying I never got fed up with having rules that made you feel 
as if you never passed out of 7th grade, but I do realize chat almost 
every rule Chey enforce here serves a purpose Co you later in life. 



108 

I am a student in the Painting trade here on center and when I 
complete and land a good paying job I can&apos;t exactly be tired when I 
come to work, nor late for that matter. So that&apos;s why there are cerfews, 
to help you get nsed to what it&apos;s like in the real world. And my employer 
won&apos;t tolerate a person strung out on drugs or abuses alcohol. And that is 
why drinking and drugs are prohibited. The lists can go en and on. But 
what everyone finds to be unfair, is really helping you for your future. 

I don&apos;t actually expect that everyone is going to come to the great 
realization that I did, but everyone still needs the opportunity to try 
and understand. I&apos;ve seen Job Corps turn people that would seem hopless 
to the rest of the world, and turn them into people that live and work 
in your community.

My name is Beverly E. Herron and I am twenty years old. 1 am the oldest of 
four and come from a single parent home, where mom works nights, collects 
child support and welfare. 

Job Corps is helping me to keep from getting on welfare and getting behind 
on payments. This is my home now. If you take this opportunity away from 
me and others then some of us will be living on the streets or in prison. 

This is our second chance to straighten up and become good citizens. I&apos;m 
learning how to keep my temper, a clean house and community. In Denison 
Job Corps Center we are also learning to respect others and ourselves. 

Job Corps is also home to a lot of single parents with small children, whose 
futures depend on their parents education and jobs. Congress says that 
they want people off welfare and not to be totally dependent on it. Yet 
Congress wants to cut back on our education and ticket to a better future. 

Please don&apos;t take the bettering of our future and others future away from 
us and them.

How Job Corps Changed My Life 
by Tonya Morgan 



Job corps has improve my life in so many ways it 
is hard to list all of them. 

I guess the biggest chartge for me is the fact that 
I finally started going to school regularly. At Job corps 
there&apos;s no where else to go, but at home there were to many 
other places. Job corps is a good program because you can 
go to high school and learn a trade at the same time. 

The way you have to be so independent is good for 
me, because it was rally time to realize mom wouldn&apos;t slways 
take care of me. I am learning to budget my money, and that 
making money the right way is the best way. While you are in 
this program you learn to do everything for yourself that mom 
did for you. 

Job corp has taught me one lesson that 1 will need 
for the rest of my life, and that&apos;s how to get along with oth- 
ers, and to deal witn others, even if I don&apos;t like them. It 
used to be that I would be ready to fight if someone lookes at 
me the wrong way. This program teaches me the work place you 
just can&apos;t beat up your boss because of a disagreement, or yo- 
u&apos;ll either end up fired and/or in jail. 

So, If you think this program doesn&apos;t teach anything 
you&apos;re wrong; it improved my life almost loo%. Because I fina- 
lly realized that without an education you can&apos;t make it. This 
society is hard these day&apos;s and an education is the best way to 
get anything you want. 



HOW JOB CORPS CHANGED m&apos; LIFE 
BY KARRIE WEAVER 



Job Corps has changed my life in so many ways. When I came in Co 
Job Corps I had nothing. I had no job skills, and I was fighting 
with my family. I was only 16, I didn&apos;t know how to handle respon- 
sibility or know how to live without my family and friends. 

Job Corps has given me job training. 1 am currently in the Health 
Occupations class. In Health Occupations, we study how to take 
temperatures, pulses, respirations and blood pressure. We also 
learn to care for people. All of this studying will help me to 
become a certified nurses assistant. If it wouldn&apos;t of been for 
my instructor, Mrs Lisa Hartman,&apos; I doubt if I would be able to take 
state boards. Mrs. Hartman has helped me so much with my classes and 
my personal life. 



110 

The counselors here at Job Corps helped me to deal with my family 
problems. They encouraged me to talk things out with my family. 
Now, because of the Counselors help, my family and I are getting 
along better. The counselors take time out of their nusy schedules 
to talk with us. 

My RA, Sheila Reitan, helped me learn responsibility by encouraging 

me to run for Dorm Government. As the Treasurer of C-2 dorm has taught 

me how to be more responsible because I have to help a dorm full of 

ladies clean. I also listen to become a better member in a group living 
atmosphere . 

Another area in Job Corps, besides my Vocation and dorm that has 
helped me are the extra activities I am in, such as Bigs, Jr.Wics, 
and peer helpers. 

If I hadn&apos;t heard of Job Corps, I might be living on the streets. If I 
could give some advice, to anyone without job skills, it would be to 
gc to Job Corp. It has helped me out alot. I would also tell then 
that it maybe hard, but it will be worth it when they complete 1 



To Whom It May Concern: 

This is in regards to the current situation in Congress concerning the Job 
Corps Program. I will be perfectly honest in that I do not tend to stay 
abreast of political situations. However, 1 air. aware of the fact that our 
new Republican majority have shown the utmost interest in down-sizing the 
federal government. 

I have just recently become aware that this down-sizing that is taking af- 
fect will include the Job Corps Program. If you have ever visited a Job 
Corps Center, no doubt, you found a lot of teenagers in both educational 
and technical training. If by chance you remained on that center tc find 
these students in their leisure time activities, I&apos;m positive you would find 
a great deal of activity in the recreation room, art room, and in the gym. 

I would not begin to say that all Job Corps Centers are perfect or run as 
smoothly as a freshly paved highway, but the students find a place that they 
can call home, not worry about where meals might come from, or if they&apos;ll 
be able to scrape together the funds to pay for school fees or clothes. 

My name is Andrea Adney and I am twenty-two years old. I have resided on 
the Denison Job Corps Center since August 9, 199A. For myself as well as 
many other students here, Job Corps was a last chance to make something of 
our lives. 

When I came to Job Corps last fall I was leaving behind a part time job at 
a fast food restaurant that paid minimum wage, in hopes of having the op- 
portunity to gain enough knowledge and experience so I wouldn&apos;t have to live 
as I had in the past. So I wouldn&apos;t have to go through trying to fit three 
adults into a two room living space, or live out of a car; not knowing where 
the next meal would come from or when. 

For me Job Corps has become a place where I can pick up the pieces of my 
life and put them together. I&apos;ve been doing that and I&apos;ve had help. For 
the first time in my life I have a couple of freinds that I trust farther 
than I can throw them. With them as well as members of the staff I&apos;ve found 
pieces of mv life that 1 didn&apos;t know were missing, and I found where they 
fit. 

Job Corps gives so many young adults the opportunity to get the training 

that will be needed to make it in the world today. Many of us who are here 

are here due solely to financial reasons, as I&apos;ve already explained that 1 

am. Being unable to affort to attend a regular &quot;institution of higher learning&quot;. 

we turn to programs such as Job Corps to build ourselves a tomorrow that we 

can all live with. 



Ill 

I hope Congress will help us to have a today that will allow us to build a 
better tomorrow than we had to look forward to yesterday. Please do not cut 
Job Corps from the Federal Budget, if you do in the long run all you will 
be doing is making the deficit rise a little for each of the approximate 
A0,000 students currently in this vital program, not to mention the count- 
less others who are waiting to come here. 

Thank you very much for your time, and hopefully your support.

Dear Senator Harkin. 

When I was a cliild 1 went throuuh nian\&apos; things \Mtli my famil\&apos; V\ith m\ brothers in and out 
of the liome and my dad running from the cops 1 ne\&apos;er went to school on a regular basis I was 
always a sman child, but never given the chance to really work hard 

Bv the time 1 was in high school 1 had a stable home and things were better There was a fe\s 
problems and I didn&apos;t want to live at home anymore I fell in love and moved in with my bo\friend 
at the age of sixteen. 1 didn&apos;t want to quit school, but by the time 1 got permission to change school 
districts it was too late 1 would have had to of taken the whole junior year over 
1 didn&apos;t want to do that So I went and I recei\&apos;ed my GED 

1 basically gave my education up for my boyfriend and his children We went through some 
hard times and split up after being together for 3 years 1 wanted to start on getting my education 
after that My best friend told me about Job Corp 1 was definitely interested So after 3 months of 
deciding what I wanted I decided to go for it 

I arrived August 23, 1994. I had no idea what to expect or hou to react It was quite a 
change for me Within the ftrst week I knew this was for me 1 made alot of friends and 1 felt real 
comfonable. After taking orientation and learning about all the trades 1 felt that this place had alot 
to offer me and anyone who is willing to take advantage of the opponunity 

If I wasn&apos;t here in Job Corp 1 would be in the streets or in a dead end Job I feel real proud 
of myself and 1 think that anyone who wants to achieve their goals will do it here 

This place has changed my life forever With all the education I receive and all the people 1 
knovs&apos; it&apos;s well worth even.- little sacrifice I make 

Sincerely, 
Karlene Jansa 



The Chairman. That concludes today&apos;s hearing.

JOB CORPS OVERSIGHT 



THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1995 

U.S. Senate, 
Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 

Washington, DC. 
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:09 a.m., in room 
SD-430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Kassebaum 
(chairman of the committee) presiding. 

Present: Senators Kassebaum, Jeffords, Frist, DeWine, Ashcroft, 
Abraham, Grorton, Kennedy, and Simon. 

Opening Statement of Senator Kassebaum 

The Chairman. The hearing will please come to order. My apolo- 
gies for starting late. Senator Kennedy and I were making a pres- 
entation before the Rules Committee on our reduction of 25 percent 
to the Labor Committee funding. Senator Kennedy is on his way, 
and I think I will go ahead with my opening statement, because 
he will be here any minute. 

Yesterday the committee heard disturbing testimony about the 
problem of violence at Job Corps centers. That testimony by young 
people who have gone to Job Corps seeking help, and from former 
staff members at Job Corps centers, was I thought powerful evi- 
dence that violence is not an isolated or incidental problem. 

In fact, the evidence suggests that Job Corps has fsiiled a central 
part of its mission — to provide a safe, secure environment for dis- 
advantaged young people who desperately want to break out of the 
cycle of poverty. 

Today we will hear from Job Corps management, staff, and ad- 
ministration witnesses on the problem of violence and other issues 
that this committee must address if Job Corps is to meet its real 
potential. I believe a key issue facing this committee is the fun- 
damental question about how Job Corps is being managed and how 
we can change a system that I think clearly has gone off course. 

The witnesses in these 2 days of hearings demonstrate that Job 
Corps has a great pool of dedicated and talented workers who de- 
serve to be backed up and supported by this committee in seeing 
that serious problems are addressed, not ignored. Denying the seri- 
ousness of these problems is not an option, and I want to make 
clear that I as chairman intend to follow through and see that real 
change occurs. 

The concerns raised about Job Corps and the severe budget lim- 
its facing Congress have brought Job Corps to a crossroads. This 
committee will have to decide what direction we want this program 

(113) 



114 

to take — whether we want this program to focus on training and 
education or to operate correctional laciHties. 

We must explore the role of private contractors and whether they 
are being held fully accountable when they play numbers games 
that place their Federal contracts above the needs of young people. 

Finally, we need to ask whether local communities should play 
a far greater role in how Job Corps centers are operated. 

I believe Job Coros serves an important and necessary role, but 
I also believe Job Corps must change, and change for the better, 
or it will die. I for one want to send a clear message that Job Corps 
must produce real results, not just glowing press releases. Now is 
the time to deal with these issues. 

We heard yesterday about what a success Job Corps had been in 
Greorge Foreman&apos;s letter about what Job Corps had meant to him. 
That was 1968. We are in a different time. We have not held over- 
sight for about 10 years in a thorough way to really analyze what 
has taken place, not only in the population being served, but the 
needs of that population that need to be met. 

So I think it is a great opportunity, but it is one that we have 
to take seriously, and I think we can only succeed by being very 
realistic and serious about the responsibilities that each and every 
one of us holds. 

Senator Gorton, we are waiting for Senator Kennedy, because I 
know he does have an opening statement. 

Senator Gorton. Madam Chairman, I have only one request. We 
received an unsolicited phone call yesterday from a woman in the 
State of Washington who had serious problems and was subject to 
an assault in one of the Job Corps sites. I have asked her to put 
this in writing, and I would simply ask that the record be kept 
open so that her letter, assuming that it comes, could be made a 
part of the record. 

The Chairman. Yes, I will be happy to do so, and as I stated yes- 
terday, the hearing record will be kept open until the end of the 
week and perhaps even until the first of next week. A number of 
people have asked if they could submit statements for the record, 
and I think it is important that the record be kept open so that ev- 
eryone can have their statements be a part of the hearing testi- 
mony. 

I will go ahead and introduce the first panel, and when Senator 
Kennedy arrives, we will go eihead, and I know he will want to 
make his comments at that time. 

It is a pleasure to welcome the first panel this morning. John 
Deering lives in Augusta, WI, where he is an admissions counselor 
for Job Corps Region 5, which includes 11 Job Corps centers in six 
States. 

Larry King is president of the Forest Service Council and direc- 
tor of tne Pine Knot Civilian Conservation Center in Kentucky. 

Dr. Robert Belfon is a pediatric dental specialist, with practices 
in Piscataway and Plainfield, NJ. He worked at the Edison Job 
Corps Center in Edison, NJ between April 1991 and June 1993. 

John McKay began working for Job Corps in 1965. He has 
worked as director of a civilian conservation center and proiect 
manager at the Job Corps regional office in Dallas. He retired last 
year and lives in Irving, TX,

It is a pleasure to welcome all of you. 

It is a pleasure to welcome the ranking member. Senator Ken- 
nedy. I explained that we were both testifying at the Rules Com- 
mittee prior to coming here. Do you have any opening comments 
you wish to make? 

Opening Statement of Senator Kennedy 

Senator Kennedy. Well, we are here to hear the witnesses. I 
thank the chair, and I want to say how much all of us appreciate 
the chairman&apos;s leadership on this issue and the reviewing that we 
are giving the Job Corps program and training programs generally. 

The purpose of this series of hearings is to find out how we can 
coordinate, consolidate and make more effective the resources that 
are being expended at the Federal level and also matched in the 
States and the private sector. 

The Job Corps program has been in existence for a considerable 
period of time and is a lifeline to many young people who have 
dropped out of school or who have had difficulties in their own aca- 
demic training, to give them a second opportunity and a chance to 
move into the future in terms of employment, or possibly the mili- 
tary service. We know that some 60,000 young people have grad- 
uated from the Job Corps programs, and close to 65 to 75 percent 
have actually been placed. 

We heard enormously distressing and disturbing reports yester- 
day of incidences of violence at Job Corps centers. A single incident 
of violence is too much, and I think all of us have to try, in any 
program, to see what can be done to make the program itself more 
efficient, more effective, and more directed; and hopefully, as a re- 
sult of these hearings today, we will get constructive suggestions 
and ideas as to how to deal with the complex problems which we 
are facing in our society, and how we can address some of the real 
challenges that are facing these young people with extraordinary 
difficulties and complex life experiences. 

It is not an easy problem; if it were £m easy issue, it would have 
been solved a long time ago. But we can certainly learn from these 
hearings, and I am looking forward to working with the chair and 
other members of the committee to try to make this a more effec- 
tive program. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. 

Mr. Deering, we will start with you. 

STATEMENTS OF JOHN P. DEERING, ADMISSIONS COUN- 
SELOR, JOB CORPS, REGION FIVE; LARRY KING, PRESIDENT, 
FOREST SERVICE COUNCIL, CCC CENTER DIRECTOR, PINE 
KNOT, KY; DR. ROBERT BELFON, PISCATAWAY, NJ; AND 
JOHN C. McKAY, IRVING, TX 

Mr. Deering. Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, members 
of the committee, my name is John Deering. I am from Wisconsin, 
and I am employed as an admissions counselor for Region 5, which 
covers 11 Job Corps centers. 

As an admissions counselor, I am the first, and most of the time 
the only person, that young men and women see before they enter 



116 

the Job Corps campus. I see the anticipation and desire in their 
eyes for a change in their Hfestyle. 

As an admissions counselor, I am also employed as a placement 
specialist. When a young person graduates from the Job Corps 
campus, it is my duty to help that person find a job. 

I believe the Job Corps program is a great program. I think it 
helps young people, and I think the rural youth of Wisconsin need 
this program. But I do believe there are problems — not only the 
problems that were mentioned before this committee yesterday, but 
other problems. 

I toured the largest campus in Region 5 in November. The in- 
struction that I was given before I even got off the bus was: Do not 
go anywhere alone; always go with another person. 

I do believe that there is violence and gang activity on these 
campuses, and frankly, I choose not to send the young people from 
my area to those campuses. Of the 11 campuses in my region, I will 
send my youth to only two — ^two small, rural facilities that I believe 
are safe. I have sent youth to some of these other campuses; they 
come home scared, they come home frustrated. 

I believe that it is time for the Job Corps program to be looked 
at, to be streamlined, and to take a serious look at the violence and 
gang activity that happens on our campuses. 

I think part of the problem with the Job Corps program is the 
Job Corps centers. They are nm on a contractual basis, and again, 
the problem here is money. Each young student graduated means 
a dollar amount to that contractor. There is no incentive for that 
contractor to send home a student who is causing problems, when 
that student may mean $400, $500, $600 to that contractor. And 
for a contractor who is already in trouble financially, it does not 
make financial sense. 

The same goes for admissions counselors such as myself. My job 
is to recruit young people. I need to recruit a specific number of 
young people each month or my job is in jeopardy. I know there 
are admissions counselors all over the country, particularly in my 
area, who will recruit anybody they can possibly get — violent gang 
member, drug abuser — it makes no difference. My job depends on 
numbers. 

That is incomprehensible, and the Job Corps program cannot be 
run that way. 

Third, I believe that the Department of Labor regional offices 
have too much control over students and too much control over the 
Job Corps campuses. I believe that if the Department of Labor had 
less control and were streamlined, the Job Corps campuses would 
be much better. 

I will make a side comment that the Civilian Conservation Corps 
campuses in my area — there are two of them — are the two cam- 
puses I send my youth to. They are rim by the Department of Agri- 
culture, they have a different mission tnan the other campuses, 
and I am proud to send my students there. 

In my statement before this committee, I have three rec- 
ommendations — streamline the Department of Labor; make the ad- 
missions counselors and the Job Corps campuses one entity — they 
are now two and sometimes three entities — that would bring ac- 
countability to Job Corps admissions counselors and the Job Corps 



117 

campuses if they worked hand-in-hand. Finally, make the Depart- 
ment of Labor responsible for oversight of the functions and not a 
controller. I believe there is too much control in our Department of 
Labor regional offices, and that control should be sent to the Job 
Corps campuses. 

Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Deering. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Deering may be found in the ap- 
pendix.] 

The Chairman. Mr. King? 

Mr. King. Good morning. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, and the other 
distinguished members of this committee for the opportunity to tes- 
tify before you today. 

My name is Larry King, and I am a 12-year employee at the 
USDA Forest Service, at the Pine Knot Civilian Conservation Cen- 
ter in Pine Knot, KY. I also serves as president of the National 
Federation of Federal Employees&apos; Forest Service Council that rep- 
resents 18 Civilian Conservation Centers and approximately 650 
Federal employees. 

First and foremost, I would like to say that the Job Corps pro- 
gram is a much needed program. We serve the kids whom everyone 
else has given up on. We provide opportunity to those who have no 
opportunity. We are truly a program of last resort. 

I would also like to go on record and say that our Forest Service 
CCCs are the best-managed and most productive centers in the 
program. However, for the past 5 years, I have lobbied for changes 
in our program; I have raised concerns regarding the way the pro- 
gram has been managed by the Department of Labor. As protection 
from the many attempts to cut the program in the past, the De- 
partment of Labor has developed elaborate systems of statistics to 
justify the program&apos;s existence. While we felt sure that this was a 
necessary evil at the time, this has become part of the problem 
with our program. Center directors are currently engaged in ob- 
taining successful statistics at any cost. They are forced to do this; 
if not, they risk the chance of DOL closing them due to low statis- 
tics. 

The single most disruptive factor is called ALOS, or average 
length of stay. This single factor weighs heavily on how a center 
is ranked by the Department. More often than not, center directors 
keep students who are disruptive, violent and who fail to make 
progress, solely for the purpose of obtaining a high ALOS. While 
ALOS tends to be the key standard in rating a center, other factors 
such as education, social adjustment, skills and vocation are treat- 
ed as side issues. 

We now have a program which has been developed to produce 
numbers, not to train highly-motivated young men and women who 
are socially well-a(^usted and competitive in today&apos;s work force. 

In recent years, the program has come under attack due to nu- 
merous negative incidents that have occurred both on Federal and 
contract centers, and the costs associated with the program. Most 
of the Job Corps population is obtained from inner cities through- 
out the Nation. 



118 

The program accepts those youth who are not functioning in our 
society for £iny one of a number of reasons. Therefore, it is under- 
standable that our centers are experiencing the same problems 
that have been occurring in the inner cities. While most students 
can be turned around, it must be recognized that not every youth 
who comes into the program will be successful. Some students do 
not benefit from the program and continue to exhibit violent behav- 
ior. Because of the ALOS requirement, these students are com- 
monly retained long after it has been determined that they should 
be removed. 

While our student population has become more aggressive and 
violent, the Job Corps program itself still functions under a 1960&apos;s 
mentality. We function under what is conceived by the rank and 
file as the &quot;poor bab^&apos; concept. Centers are now allowed to enforce 
discipline or maintain a proauctive atmosphere in which social de- 
velopment can occur. DOL policy in regard to discipline reflects 
standards under which students do not have to be responsible for 
their actions. Instead, centers operate under the concept that the 
student&apos;s background is justification for whatever actions the stu- 
dent takes. In other words, our students are not responsible for 
their poor behavior — society is. 

We currently have a DOL administration which highly favors the 
use of contract centers. It should be noted that when contract cen- 
ters were established, they were run by major corporations to train 
prospective employees. This is not the case today. Currently, any- 
one can establish a contract center. A contractor&apos;s primary objective 
is to make money, not to train students. Contractors provide the 
minimum training environment needs for the students, with profit 
dictating their choices. 

In comparison, Federal centers are set up to provide quality 
training, not to make profit. The cost difference, however, between 
the two kinds of centers is not that great. The quality of training, 
education and social environments found in the two Icinds of cen- 
ters is strikingly different. Federally-operated centers have by far 
the best managed and most productive training environments. 

The additional cost of the Federal centers is offset by the value 
of the projects that students produce during training. Specifically, 
students at contract centers are taught by building mock-ups or 
simulated construction projects. Federal centers teach students 
skills by actual construction of public facilities, such as ranger sta- 
tions, visitor centers, and Job Corps centers themselves. Many com- 
munities around Federal centers have greatly benefited from 
projects completed by Job Corps students. 

We believe that the current DOL Job Corps administration must 
change before any real progress can take place. In fact, we suggest 
a complete flush of the current DOL Job Corps administration, 
from the Washington level through the regional offices. 

If the current administration and the philosophy are not 
changed, the program will never become a vehicle to effectively 
serve those who need it most — the students and the taxpayers of 
this country. 

The committee should know that this program is a good program, 
a needed program, a program that serves kids whom no one else 
wants to deal with, a program that changes many potential de- 



119 

pendents of the Government into taxpaying citizens. We do make 
a aifference in the lives of these kids. The pubHc does benefit from 
our program. 

However, we recognize that we can and we should improve. Re- 
cently, the Forest Service reorganized our national and regional 
Job Corps structure to cut overhead costs and streamline the orga- 
nization. We, the employees, and the NFFE Forest Service Council 
stand ready and willing to work with anyone, at an^ time, to im- 
prove the program so that it will be truly the best m the Nation. 

If eliminating the Job Corps program is on the committee&apos;s mind, 
I ask that you reconsider and help us put one of the best programs 
in the Nation back on track. The kids need it, and the taxpayers 
deserve it. Eliminating the program is not the cure; fixing it is. We 
need a program based on accountability, not accounting. 

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. King. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. King may be found in the appen- 
dix.] 

The Chairman. Dr. Belfon? 

Dr. Belfon. Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, members 
of the committee, I wish to thank you for inviting me to testify. 

My name is Robert Belfon, and I am a pediatric dental specialist 
with practices in Piscataway and Plainfield, NJ. I was a contracted 
medical services provider at the Edison Job Corps facility from the 
period of April 1991 through June 1993 in Edison, NJ, which was 
administered for the DOL by ITT. 

In early February 1991, I was contacted by the medical staff of 
Edison Job Corps, which requested that I see a few of the resident 
Corps members in my office for the purpose of providing dental 
treatment. The arrangement suited us, and I agreed. 

Subsequently, Mrs. Jacqueline Tchir, the then health services 
manager, inquired if I might be interested in joining them as a con- 
tracted dental services provider. She went on to explain to me the 
philosophy of Job Corps and how it served the underprivileged and 
possibly misdirected youth, many of them from inner cities and 
many of them from minority groups. She also explained to me the 
many training programs that were set up for young people, and 
how for many of them, it was their first time out of the ghetto and 
a drug-ridden environment. 

Well, I must admit that I found the proposition challenging. As 
a 46-year-old African American male who was raised in the South- 
west Bronx in a housing project, and a former gang member, I 
know that I could never have survived my teenage years in the tur- 
bulent 1960&apos;s without many of the guardian angels who helped me 
and shaped me into what I am today. Indeed, many, if not most, 
of the young men who were my contemporaries in that housing 
project never made it to their 25th birthday, let alone out of the 
ghetto. 

So needless to say, I jumped at the chance to give something 
back and maybe make a difference in some kid&apos;s life. I guess I even 
saw myself as a role model, as I assumed the other staff members 
and administrators undoubtedly were. 

Well, I was certainly wrong in my assumptions. I soon found out 
that what we had in Edison was the Edison Job Corps Center ghet- 
to dumping ground. By this statement, I mean that these young 



120 

people were taken out of a negative environment of many inner 
cities in the tri-State area only to be placed in another negative en- 
vironment in Edison, NJ, to be victims of another system that had 
no concern for the human being, but just for the slot that he or she 
occupied. If all the slots were filled, then all was right with the 
world and Job Corps. It was nothing but a numbers game. 

The center director&apos;s mandate was to preserve the census so that 
the Government checks kept coming in. To keep the census up, 
HIV tests were misdated, positive arug screening tests were ig- 
nored, and medical problems not noted in charts. Many things were 
done to keep the residents in and to facilitate and keep the num- 
bers. 

There were in fact several times that as per the Job Corps hand- 
book, I was obligated to terminate certain residents for medical 
reasons and/or noncompliance of medical treatment. However, 
when I discussed this with the medical director and the center di- 
rector, I was advised b^ the center director that her interpretation 
of my instructions, which were in fact in the Job Corps handbook, 
was different. She refused to allow the terminations to go through, 
and after I discussed this matter with the regional director of den- 
tistry, he advised me that the center director should not have over- 
ridden my medical recommendations. 

Other measures that were taken to keep the residents happy and 
compliant included allowing them to conduct their social activities, 
including sexual, anv place they saw fit — under our windows, in 
the bushes, behind the buildings. In the spring and summer, there 
was an unusually high number of cases of poison ivy that came 
through our medical department. Students were allowed not to go 
to class, to hang out in the stairwells, hallways, and even in the 
infirmary. 

The residents who were assigned to the medical department to 
help clean up were allowed, after they felt they were finished, to 
sleep side-by-side with residents who were housed in the infirmary 
for various illnesses. This was standard procedure throughout the 
entire time that I was there. 

The Job Corps members were the only losers. They were not 
being prepared for a job, or for a life outside the center; nor were 
they being taught the basic skills needed to find, keep, and func- 
tion in a job. 

As a matter of fact, a common complaint among the residents 
was that many of the training programs that they were advised 
they could participate in before they joined were either no longer 
offered or had never been offered at that center. 

Drug use and trafficking of the same were also overlooked. It 
was common knowledge around the center that certain residents 
sold drugs in and out of Job Corps. In one particular case, there 
was a resident who drove a $30,000 customized BMW and would 
periodically be AWOL for weeks at a time, only to return to the 
center and continue his business deals. Yet nothing was ever done 
by the center director about this. 

Violent behavior was allowed. The dental department reported 
numerous incidences of negative and violent attitudes and behav- 
iors, such as threats of a physical nature. These incident reports 
were never acknowledged. It was common knowledge among staff 



121 

members that incident reports were not worth the ink they were 
written with. Many violent residents went on to injure other staff 
members and/or residents. 

This tvpe of behavior was disruptive and detrimental to the resi- 
dents wno wanted to make proper use of the program and opportu- 
nities. Instead of establishing aeterrents for tnis negative behavior 
by enforcing the rules, they were allowed to continually disrupt 
others and exhibit antisocial behavior, without any fear of con- 
sequences. 

These young people were falling victims to the same negativity 
that presumably, they had come to Job Corps to avoid or overcome. 

I must tell you that as a taxpayer, I condemn this misuse and 
abuse of moneys, and as an African American male, I resent the 
for-profit ghetto created by DOL and ITT, which only benefited the 
people who were running the programs. 

Throughout my stewardship of the dental department, I wrote 
and forwarded many letters and other correspondence to both DOL 
and ITT in reference to these incidents and irregularities, but they 
were all ignored. 

I wish to thank you very much for this opportunity to testify. 

The Chairman. Thank you. Dr. Belfon. 

[The prepared statement of Dr. Belfon may be found in the ap- 
pendix.] 

The Chairman. Mr. McKay? 

Mr. McKay. Chairman I^ssebaum, members of the committee, 
my voice is a little rough as a result of the Dallas game last Sun- 
day. 

I entered the Job Corps program in 1965, shortly after its incep- 
tion. I came from the public school systems in Texas and Okla- 
homa. I first served as deputy director of a conservation center for 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and then later as acting center direc- 
tor of that center. Later, I transferred to the Office of Economic Op- 
portunity as their national training director, and then was assigned 
at the national level as a project manager. 

In 1971, when regionalization came about, and the Department 
of Labor took over administration of the program, I transferred to 
the Dallas office as a project manager. 

In the interest of time, I will just briefly State my opinion of the 
problems, as I see them, in Job Corps. 

I see these problems as essentially the result of a policy that 
seems to reward contractors, but places the welfare and achieve- 
ment of students far down the ladder of objectives. Speaking as 
someone who has seen the program from the inside, I can honestly 
say that I do not believe it is worth the $1 billion a year that we 
are spending on it now. 

One of the reasons is violence on centers. 

The Chairman. Mr. McKay, could you pull the mike just a little 
closer? Thank you. The Cowboys did not win, either, did they? 

Mr. McKay. They did not win; it was that 21 points to begin 
with that got me. I am an old coach. Senator. [Laughter.] 

In August 1992, I got a telephone call from Senator Bumpers&apos; of- 
fice in ^kansas, asking me about conditions at the center at Little 
Rock. I was very cautious, as I had no program responsibilities at 
Little Rock, and I told them that. The yoimg lady I spoke with, 



122 

Rose Collins, said, &quot;Mr. McKay, your name has been given to us 
as one who will be honest with us.&quot; 

I looked into the serious incidents in Little Rock, and I called Ms. 
Collins back and told her that everything she asked about had been 
verified. 

Later, on review of two centers in our region, I was looking at 
discipline, and I learned that at the first center, two security offi- 
cers had been beaten so badly by Corps members that they had to 
be hospitalized. At the second center, a vocational instructor was 
beaten so badly that he was off the job for 3 months. This instruc- 
tor asked me not to include this in the review, because he feared 
repercussions from his center. 

I took both of these problems to the regional director and asked 
him to include them in the annual center review, and he refused 
to do so. 

The assistant district attorney of Chavez County, NM threatened 
to arrest center administration at the Roswell Center because they 
had knowledge of an alleged rape. They did not notify the police, 
and they allowed the 20-year-old person who allegedly committed 
the rape to resign from the center and leave the State. 

Serious incident reports as I reviewed them in the past year, 
1992-1993, proved to me that incidents of gang-related and dope- 
related problems had increased. 

I was asked to say something about the performance measure- 
ment system, a system designed to judge the effectiveness of the 
centers. I worked on records of PMS every time I monitored a cen- 
ter I was assigned to, or on the eight or nine annual reviews that 
I made. I never reviewed records that were completely accurate. 

In discussing this problem with staff members, some of them told 
me that if they did not come up with positive results, it would 
mean their jobs. I am speaking of the categories of vocational 
completers, reading and math gains, and length of stay. 

Job Corps did develop a good policy handbook. However, their 
biggest problem, in my opinion, was when the administration de- 
cided to admit students with serious criminal backgrounds and 
drug-related problems. You may recall that in the original GEO 
program, students with such backgrounds were precluded from en- 
tering Job Corps. 

Policies were frequently ignored. The best example I can give you 
is that we have mandatory termination for discipline problems, and 
if necessary, centers would ignore this. 

I would like to make some brief comments on program mis- 
management. I witnessed the following problems of mismanage- 
ment, ethics, and possibly illegal activities in my tenure in the Job 
Corps over the past decade. I would be pleased to provide the com- 
mittee with further information regarding these many problems. 

High-level Job Corps officials have had improper relations and 
interactions with contractors, including providing confidential in- 
formation regarding bids on Job Corps centers to incumbent or fa- 
vored contractors. 

There has been collusion among contractors regarding not to bid 
against each other on certain center contracts. I have seen many 
contracts awarded in violation of Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
There have been many high-cost settlements made to protect cor- 



123 

porate and possibly high-level Federal staff paid for with appro- 
priated funds and then sealed to protect the facts. There has been 
little if £iny congressional oversight in the past 10 years. 

I would like to offer some recommendations, but in the interest 
of time, I will not, but would ask that they be included in the 
record. 

Thank you, Senator, 

The Chairman. They will be fully included in the record. Thank 
you, Mr. McKay. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. McKay may be found in the ap- 
pendix.] 

The Chairman. I will save my questions and yield my time right 
now to Senator Jeffords. 

Senator Jeffords. I thank the chair. I have to go off to another 
adventure, similarly related. 

I have been following Job Corps for some 20 years now, 14 in the 
House and 6 in the Senate, so I have been through the ups and 
downs of the Corps over the years. I think we have to keep in mind 
what the Corps was designed for, and I will just quote some statis- 
tics to emphasize that we cannot just end up changing our philoso- 
phy and &quot;creaming,&quot; just picking out the great kids who need some 
help. 

The cost, as you know, is around $20,000 per student. That is 
two to four times what other options cost. On the other hand, the 
failure in both human and financial terms — when you recognize 
that it costs some $60,000 to incarcerate someone, and you recog- 
nize that up to 80 percent of those incarcerated are school drop- 
outs, you can see that there can be a tremendous advantage to hav- 
ing success in the Job Corps if we do pick out those who are at risk 
but do have potential and are able to give them a good education. 

Where I do become concerned, though, is as to whether we have 
any measure of outcomes or longitudinal studies that you are 
aware of that indicate to us that we have had success in these pro- 
grams and that we have reduced the number that will end up in- 
carcerated. If anybody has that, I would appreciate that informa- 
tion, and second, how do we try to balance those who are there so 
that we do not end up with gangs, and at the same time, we do 
not end up with, as I said earlier, just picking the best out there 
so that our statistics look good. I would appreciate your comments 
on that. 

Mr. King? 

Mr. King. I have no real knowledge on the job placement. At one 
time, I understood that basically, if the kid went on the job for 1 
day, he was counted successful. That may have changed since the 
last time I knew anything about that. 

This program is a great program, and nobody even questions 
that. We do question me administration of the program and how 
it is being administered. In bringing the kids in, yes, I think we 
should be open; we should try to take in as many kids as we can 
possibly work with. But we have got to recognize that we are work- 
ing with some kids who have been very unsuccessful throughout 
their young lives, and we cannot get every kid who comes into the 
program turned around; we cannot be 100 percent, 100 percent of 



124 

the time. That is unrealistic, and it puts you in a skewed environ- 
ment. 

Senator Jeffords. Mr. Deering? 

Mr. Deering. Senator, I believe there are several answers to 
your question, from my standpoint as an admissions coimselor. One 
of the problems that I have in the State of Wisconsin is checking 
backgrounds on youth. For any young person under the age of 18 
who is a juvenile, those records are sealed, so I can get no knowl- 
edge of a criminal background, and it is very tough for me to dis- 
tinguish any youth who has a criminal background. And I think it 
is very difficult for an admissions counselor, whose job is on the 
line, to distinguish between wanting to keep his job and sending 
in youth who are appropriate, and keeping the numbers up so he 
does not lose his job. I think that is a vital problem that the Job 
Corps program has, and I see it. 

On the other end of that, I think the administration of the pro- 
gram at the Job Corps center level is also mishandled. There are 
many youth on the Job Corps centers who see violence, who are in- 
volved in violent activities, who are not sent home. Again, I deal 
with many young people who are at their rope&apos;s end. I get calls 
from schools and human service agencies every day, saying, This 
is this kid&apos;s last chance,&quot; and judges, saying, &quot;Take this voung per- 
son away, or he will be incarcerated.&quot; These are the kinds of young 
people that Job Corps is dealing with. 

Many of these young people do well in the Job Corps program. 
Many of them do not. As an admissions counselor, I have no way 
of telling which youth will work in the Job Corps center £ind whicn 
youth will not. That has to be up to the Job Corps center staff. My 
opinion is that the Job Corps center staff are not doing that job 
productively, and we are keeping too many students on center who 
are inappropriate. 

How we determine who is appropriate on center and who is not, 
I cannot answer that. 

Senator Jeffords. Thank you. 

Mr. McKay? 

Mr. McKay. I agree with you. I think we need to serve these stu- 
dents as long as we can. 

Senator Jeffords. Thank you. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator Jeffords. 

Senator Kennedy? 

Senator Kennedy. Thank you very much. 

I thank the members of the panel. I think the last comments are 
enormously important to consider as we are looking at Job Corps. 
The growth of violence among young people in this country in the 
period of recent years has just exploded. Every superintendent of 
every school can tell you about it. A lot of them are doing very cre- 
ative and imaginative things — I know they are in my State, and I 
am sure in many other States as well — to try to deal with it. 

We are dealing with the problem of school dropouts, we are deal- 
ing with the phenomenon of the growth of youth gangs, we are 
dealing with the explosion of youth violence, particularly among 
younger people. In my State, any young person who is incarcerated 
costs $75,000 within Route 128, and about $45,000 outside Route 



125 

128. So we see judges making decisions about what they are going 
to do with these young people and where they are going to go. This 
is a very tough crowd. 

But that does not excuse the kinds of situations that you have 
outHned here, and the extraordinary abuses that Mr, McKay has 
outHned here. I know you were outraged by it and complained 
about it, and why you did not get more action, maybe there is a 
good explanation for it that you want to comment on, but certainly, 
with that kind of record, I think there is some responsibility to 
take it not just to the immediate superior but to others as well. 

One of the points that seems to run through here, though, is the 
incentives for recruiting. We hear a great deal about privatization, 
and I am all for it where we can have it. But just listening to this 
panel talk about how this is put out in a contract, and you get a 
contractor who is going to get the lowest cost in order to be able 
to compete £md meet Federal regulations; then, there is the issue 
of how we are going to be able to get profit, how we are going to 
keep those young people in the slots; and then, why we ought to 
keep them. So you have all of the incentives, as you mention here, 
going the wrong way. 

I am not here to say that a Federal bureaucrat can manage this 
thing any better, although I was interested in the Conservation 
Corps — that is run by the Department of Agriculture, is that right? 

Me. King. That is correct. Senator. 

Senator Kennedy. And from what Mr. Deering has said, that ap- 
pears to be a better progn^&apos;am; am I right on that? Mr. Deering, you 
mentioned that the two schools that you do send people to are the 
Conservation Corps Centers? 

Mr. Deering. Yes, Senator Kennedy. In Region 5, those are what 
I perceive as the two best centers, simply because they are small, 
and they are in rural communities. 

Senator Kennedy. That, I am sure, has something to do with it. 
There are many factors, I am sure, but I think one of the things 
that we will have to deal with which is pretty fundamental is the 
recruitment and the establishment of these programs, and the con- 
tracting and the maintenance, and the fact that it is a bottom-line 
item that these contractors are going to profit more by keeping the 
gang member who is committing violence, selling drugs, or doing 
some other inappropriate behavior, in order to make a buck. That 
undermines the program, it is unfair to the other kids, it is out- 
rageous in terms of the other young people, it is denying them an 
opportunity, and we have got to try to deal with this. 

I do not know whether you have any recommendations, and I am 
sure that that in and of itself is not the problem. In my State, we 
have some Job Corps programs, and I wish they were better, but 
there are some good programs. In other places, we have seen how 
the Job Corps centers are tied into the communities in a more ef- 
fective way, are tied into the local law enforcement, are tied into 
the education system, and are tied into the private sector in terms 
of the training programs, and have been much more localized. 

You can ask yourself, should you take a kid fi-om the Job Corps 
in Boston and send him to South Carolina; does that make any 
sense, if he can go to a better program where he can get more focus 
and attention and coordination — whether it is law enforcement. 



126 

and he can come back sind say, &apos;This guy is a bad person. He is 
causing these problems, and you are better off getting rid of him,&quot; 
or &quot;This one ought to get a second chance.&quot; 

Do you have any suggestions on how to estabHsh the program so 
that those incentives are not going the wrong way, as you have out- 
lined; and second, do you have any suggestions in terms of the 
structure of the program, and how you might see involvement of 
local law enforcement, local education, and local private sectors, so 
they could work more effectively and get away from the Depart- 
ment? I know the time is moving along, but could you please ad- 
dress those questions? 

Mr. King. Yes, Senator Kennedy. I think first, you and Senator 
Kassebaum need to know that we feel the CCCs are the best pro- 
gram. We feel that we are being held constantly hostage by the De- 
partment of Labor, under threats of contracting us out. We hear 
that every day: If you guys do not hop through this hoop, then by 
Grod, we will just contract the rest of the CCCs out. We live under 
that threat day to day. 

Second, you talked about centers and locations. If you look at the 
Glen Mills approach and some of the other programs out there that 
are doing very, very well 

Senator Kennedy. Well, explain to us about contracting out and 
what that means. What are they trying to say to you? 

Mr. King. What they are trying to say is that if we do not con- 
form to the statistical means and methods they have, such as 
ALOS, then they will contract the CCCs out; they will close out 
centers, lay off our Federal employees, and turn those centers over 
to the private contractors who are already running the contract 
centers. We live with that throughout every day. 

Senator Kennedy. I see. The point I am trying to get at is the 
best way to get it done. You say that that is not a good way to do 
it — and we do not want to get caught up in these generalities, and 
we do not want to say that there are not superb programs that 
have not been run through contracting — but how do you suggest 
that we address the issue of the incentives that are built into the 
system, that I understand are going the wrong way in terms of the 
contracting out — the fact that you will get more people in there, 
and keep the bad apples, the ones you should not have in there. 

Mr. King. I started to mention a program called Glen Mills, 
which is in Pennsylvania. They deal with the same population of 
young people that we deal with, and their strategy and their phi- 
losophy is just 180 degrees different from what we are doing. We 
are doing accounting. They are doing a socialization program. They 
are moving these kids out of the culture that they are in — ^you are 
talking about Boston, an inner city environment, you move those 
kids out of that environment, and you put them in a culture where 
success is the norm — they call it &quot;normative culture&quot; — it is the nor- 
mal thing to be. Instead of being a gang member, you get your 
GED, and you are around other kids who do that, you are around 
other people who are successful. 

So changing the environment and changing the culture is abso- 
lutely fundamental. If you leave the kids in the same environment, 
doing the same things that they do every day, that is what you are 
going to get. True organizational insanity is doing the same things 



127 

the same way and expecting different results. You are not going to 
succeed unless you move the kids out of that environment. 

Senator ICennedy. Mr. Deering? 

Mr. Deering. Senator Kennedy, from my perspective as an ad- 
missions counselor, I work for a contracting agency. The Job Corps 
centers are different contracting agencies. My belief is that if we 
made the admissions counselors and the Job Corps centers the 
same contracting agency, there would be continuity between myself 
and the center directors. I believe center directors should be ulti- 
mately responsible for the recruitment of youth in their areas. That 
puts the responsibility for the youth who are eligible not on me as 
an admissions counselor, but on that center director. That makes 
the center director ultimately responsible for a) the youth who 
come to that Job Corps center, and b) the youth who leave that 
center. To me, that is the answer to the problem. 

Senator Kennedy. Could I just get other panel members&apos; reac- 
tion to that suggestion? 

Mr. King. That is not a bad idea at all. 

Senator Kennedy. Mr. McKay? 

Mr. McKay. I think it is great — ^local input, local employment. 

Senator Kennedy. Dr. Belfon? 

Dr. Belfon. As a medical provider, it really would not be appro- 
priate for me to comment. 

Senator Kennedy. I understand. Thank you. 

I thank you for the suggestions. If you have others, I hope you 
will express those. Thank you very much. 

Mr. McKay. Senator Kennedy, you cited a comment I made. I did 
try to go through other avenues. I wrote a letter to Pete Rell in the 
national office, and also a letter to this committee through my 
union activities; I was a local steward in the union. So I tried. 

Senator Kennedy. I see. Thank you. 

Mr. King. I would like to add to that. Senator Kennedy, this is 
just part of one file that I have put together. I have written, and 
I have been on the Hill and tried everything I could do to change 
the program. 

Senator Kennedy. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Senator Frist? 

Senator Frist. I also would like to thank each of you for your 
testimony today. 

Dr. Belfon, your testimony is most disturbing to me in that very 
little positive at all came out. Was there anything positive that you 
saw in the particular center that you participated in? 

Dr. Belfon. Oh, yes, sir, there were many things that I felt were 
positive in the center. I felt that there were many Corps members 
who wanted to complete the program and get through, and I did 
in fact see many get through and go on to be successful. 

The great problem I had with the program was that there were 
other kids who were quite disruptive, and that just made it very 
hard for the kids who wanted to be successful and who wanted to 
use the program for what it was intended. 

Senator Frist. And to change that, what would you rec- 
ommend — at that particular center, what would you recommend? 

Dr. Belfon. At that particular center, first of all, when there are 
youth who are disruptive, maybe they should not be sent home; 



128 

maybe there should be some kind of alternative for them, maybe 
something like a boot camp type program that they might partici- 
pate in, that is a little bit stricter, so that they would know they 
had to do what was necessary, and then they could eventually be 
integrated into the general program. 

Senator Frist. M\d how much of that is driven by the statis- 
tical — keeping people in a program so that you can report statis- 
tics — and this may be for you, Mr. King, or Mr. Deering. How much 
of what Dr. Belfon just said is driven by the statistical record- 
keeping and accounting? 

Mr. King. You have nit the problem. That is absolutely the prob- 
lem. You cannot correct any of this as long as you are hopping 
through these statistical hoops. If you have to be 100 percent, 100 
percent of the time, and you live and die by that number, then vou 
are going to do anything you can do to get the number, and then 
the program, whether you are training or whatever, that is a side 
issue. 

Senator Frist. And do you eliminate the statistical hoops bv 
bringing it down to more regional control, or local control, or back 
to this local standard-setting. 

Mr. King. I want to echo what Dr. Belfon said. One of the rec- 
ommendations that I made to NPR was to establish orientation 
centers before the kids could come to the main Job Corps centers, 
with basically a boot camp atmosphere, to get their attention, to 
get them focused. If you have kids who are drug-dependent, if you 
have kids with mental problems, you can address those problems 
right there, before we make that big investment of $20,000 that 
you are talking about. There, we can do that. We cannot try to 
train, educate, socialize and try to deal with kids with these prob- 
lems at the centers, all at the same time. It is a really bad system. 

Senator Frist. So everybody would go through that orientation 
process? 

Mr. King. Yes. 

Senator Frist. And would that help with what vou were talking 
about, Mr. Deering, as to predicting — this lack oi predictability is 
a fundamental problem; it clearly cannot be done — if you haa an 
orientation program like that, would that allow you to further sift 
through and predict? And clearly, we do not want to take just the 
people who are going to do well, but those whom you can poten- 
tially help. 

Mr. Deering. Yes, Senator, I believe that it would. 

The State of Minnesota does quite a good job. There is a Job 
Corps center in Minneapolis, and there is a local governmental 
body on the board of that program; the Grovernor is involved. The 
State of Minnesota Job Corps, which is in Region 5, is an institu- 
tion that works totally on its own in the State, and I think because 
they work on that small local network, they do some of those 
things. I think that is a good program, and I would urge the com- 
mittee to take a look at the Job Corps center in the State of Min- 
nesota. There need to be some changes, and I think an orientation 
program would be a great idea. 

Senator Frist. This goes to Mr. King and also to Mr. McKay, be- 
cause one of your recommendations was to abolish the existing 30- 
year procedure for awarding contracts, and it goes again to what 



129 

Mr. King said. Could you shed a little more light on if you abol- 
ished it, what would you replace it with? 

Mr. King. It has been my belief that instead of expanding the 
program — I am on a CCC, so contracting, I am limited on — ^but in- 
stead of expanding the program, I think we should strengthen 
what we have in place. We are taking resources away from a pro- 
gram that we already have in place which could strengthen our 
program, such as orientation centers. 

Somebody else has to speak on the contracting. I am not familiar 
with that. 

Mr. McKay. I do not see anything wrong with the contractors. 
I think it should be more localized. I think tne recruits should come 
from the immediate area, and you should work with the employers 
in that area. I think the contracting situation, whether through 
local, State, Federal, will still work. 

Senator Frist. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. Thank you. 

I thank the four witnesses. Your testimony has been very helpful 
to us. We are now in our second day of testimony, and several 
things, at least to my mind, are becoming apparent. One is that we 
have created a system that puts a premium on a numbers game, 
that puts a premium, as Senator Kennedy was referring to, wneth- 
er we privatize, contract out, whatever we do. But we have created 
that system in the Government. We have created a system where 
we tell the contractor we are going to reward him for the number 
of people he has in, for the number of people who physically get 
through the program and accumulate this time. 

We are not, to my knowledge, at least, rewarding or penalizing 
the contractor based on the only result that I think really matters, 
and that is where is this person 6 months from now after he leaves 
the program; where is he a year from now; does he have a job? And 
whether it be the same job he got immediately or whether it is a 
job he was trained for, I am not sure is that relevEint. It may have 
some relevance. But it seems to me the question is where is he in 
his life. 

I would like any of you who would like to to comment on my com- 
ment. Am I wrong in this regard, or not? Is that the situation that 
we have created? 

Mr. King. Well, Senator, you have heard several good sugges- 
tions and ideas, and once again, as you know, we submitted to 
NPR; and you are going to hear them all day long. The problem 
is you cannot get them into the Department of Labor. They are not 
gomg to listen to you. They are not going to listen to people who 
do the job every day, who point out these problems and say, &quot;Gee, 
maybe we should chamge our accounting,&quot; as you suggested. You 
cannot get that through to the Department. They are not going to 
listen to you. They are not going to listen to us. 

Senator DeWine, Mr. Deering? 

Mr. Deering. Senator, we do keep track of statistics of where 
youth are 6 months after the Job Corps program, whether they are 
vocational completers or they go AWOL. We keep track of statistics 
on minimum wage and how much that person is making, the type 



130 

of job he has, it is congruent with the job he trained for. Those sta- 
tistics, again, are skewed, maybe not by the Department of Labor, 
but by the way we go about them. 

It would seem to me that we should lengthen that period of fol- 
low-through to more than 6 months, to maybe a year, to find out 
where those students are further down the road. 

Senator DeWine. And how are the statistics skewed? 

Mr. Deering. Well, one of the statistics we have is the average 
wage the Job Corps student makes. I think it is approximately 
$5.69 an hour. That takes into consideration all the young people 
who go into Job Corps, come home without completing their voca- 
tion and go to work at McDonald&apos;s. That will automatically bring 
that wage down. It is not what I would consider an accurate de- 
scription of those young people who are going out and making 
wages at $15, $16, and $17 an hour. That is how I believe the sta- 
tistic is skewed. 

Senator DeWine. I took the opportunity yesterday to have sev- 
eral of my staff members back in Ohio visit Job Corps centers, one 
in Dayton and one in Cincinnati, and I was surprised to find what 
at least they explained to me — and I would like for you to comment 
on it in regard to your own experience — ^the disconnect between the 
placement for a job and that job center. 

I was told, if I understood the conversation correctly that I had 
this morning with my staff member, that in one of the Ohio offices, 
for example, the people who are involved in job placement are not 
in Ohio. Is that possible? 

Mr. Deering. Yes, sir, it is definitely possible. We have contrac- 
tors doing placement in the State of Wisconsin whose main offices 
are in Chicago. 

Senator DeWdje. How can that work? 

Mr. Deering. It does not, sir. That is part of the problem. As the 
admissions counselor, I do dual duty as admissions and placement. 
There are other organizations that contract just to do placement. 

It is not reasonable for an organization having an office in Chi- 
cago or Dayton to place a student in Eau Claire, WI. IT is impos- 
sible. I do not know how it happens. I have a hard time doing it, 
and I am 40 and 50 miles away from the students I work with. 

Senator DeWesje. Mr. King? 

Mr. King. I am in Kentucky, and our placement office is in At- 
lanta, to give you an idea. But I would like to say that the AFL- 
CIO trades on our CCCs do work very much hand-in-hand with the 
kids, placing them through their locals. 

Senator DeWine. And that was another thing that we found out 
from the Cincinnati office, the close connect between labor and the 
actual placement, which I think is a very, very positive thing, very, 
very positive. I was very happy to hear about that. 

It seems that there is a real disconnect not only from the place- 
ment, but in the actual recruitment; that in some cases, the re- 
cruitment is — and I think that goes back, Mr. Deering, to what you 
were saying — and it seems to me what several members of the 
panel are saying is that you have to really get the recruitment not 
only for the job after the fact, but the recruitment for who goes into 
the program much more tied to the individuals who are ultimately 



131 

going to be held accountable, which is the people who run that par- 
ticular program. Is that my understanding? 

Mr. Deerd^g. Yes, it is, sir. I speak weekly with the center direc- 
tor from the Job Corps center in the State of Wisconsin. I have a 
very good working relationship with that center. I have never spo- 
ken with some of the center airectors from the other centers. Un- 
less I have a student going there, I do not even know what pro- 
grams are being offered in those centers. The information that I re- 
ceive from some of those centers is very old. 

I make a point of contacting the center director, the orientation 
specialist, whoever it is on a center that I work with closely. The 
Blackwell Center, I have a great relationship with. That is why my 
recommendation to this committee is take those two organizations, 
the centers and the admissions people, and put them together; then 
there has to be communication between the two, where right how, 
there is not. 

Senator DeWine. Well, there has to be accountability, too, 

Mr. Deering. Absolutely. 

Senator DeWine. I mean, ultimately, someone is going to have 
to be accountable. If I am going to be judged on my performance, 
it seems to me I would want to nave input both ways, both incom- 
ing as well as the actual placement in the job, ana then hold me 
accountable. 

Mr. Deering. There is no continuity. The centers keep track of 
all the students that I send. If I continually send students that are 
inappropriate, the center has no recourse to me, because my main 
office is in Chicago, and my director is saying, &apos;Tou keep your 
numbers up. We do not care about what is going in.&quot; 

Senator DeWine. Thank you. I see my time is up. Thank you 
very much. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

Senator Abraham? 

Senator Abraham. Thank you. 

I just have a couple of questions. Mr. Deering, Region 5 I think 
includes Michigan. 

Mr. Deering. Yes, it does, sir. 

Senator Abraham. I think we have two sites in our State. We 
heard testimony yesterday about problems at various sites. Can 
you shed any light for me on what might be going on at these sites, 
from your perspective, EUid how do you think they are operating? 

Mr. Deering. I cannot comment on the Job Corps center in De- 
troit. It is one of those centers that recruits only from the city of 
Detroit. The Grand Rapids center is a center that I have not been 
on. I can only tell you what I hear from admissions counselors in 
the State of Michigan. I would not send any of my youth to that 
center. The admissions counselor in the State of Michigan has told 
me that he is fearful when he travels to that center. So unless a 
student has relatives or family in that area, I would not send a stu- 
dent there. And for what reason, I do not know, I do believe they 
are making some good changes. I have heard some positive things 
about that center. As of yet, I would not send anyone there. 

Senator Abraham. This whole panel has outlined problems. This 
is a problem in the Job Corps per se that is about 30 years old, 
I guess. The concept of CCC camps goes back a lot further. In fact, 



132 

my own father was in a CCC camp in northern Michigan many 
years ago. 

The problems you are describing have evolved, though, and I 
would like to get a sense of when you think the deterioration and 
the problems with respect to the standards began to occur. It has 
certainly not just happened over the last 12 months. Give me what 
your sense is. 

Mr. King? 

Mr. King. I would say we started declining about 10 years ago; 
in the last 5 years, it has been pretty rapid. Once again, that is 
with the more elaborate statistical and accounting programs to go 
the rough than ever before; contractors have expanded. That is my 
view of things from being in the program for 12 years. 

Senator Abraham. Mr. McKay? 

Mr. McKay. I would agree, in the 5-year time frame. 

Senator Abraham. Dr. Belfon? 

Dr. Belfon. The problems that I observed, sir, were basically 
consistent throughout the time I was there. 

Senator Abraham. Mr. Deering? 

Mr. Deering. I cannot comment on that, sir. I have not been 
with the Job Corps program for that long. But I can tell you that 
this program has been around for 30 years, and there are commu- 
nities in Wisconsin that have never heard of it. So for the northern 
part of the State of Wisconsin, it has been a 30-year problem. 

Mr. King. We do have employees who have worked for their en- 
tire lives on the centers, and from my discussions with those folks, 
I would say 5 to 10 years. They shake their heads and say, &quot;Gree, 
you should have been here when the program was this.&quot; 

Senator Abraham. My reason for asking is that I think some- 
times in Washington, we tend to look at thmgs in the political con- 
text too often. The program problems you are describing are not 
ones that are just 2 years old; they did not start with this adminis- 
tration, and they were not just part of the last administration. 
They have sort of developed over a lot of different administrations 
and political contexts. 

So as we approach trying to solve these problems, I would like 
to make sure we look at it not in the political sense, but in terms 
of that it is not just one person&apos;s fault or one administration&apos;s fault, 
and that it is something that hopefully we can approach without 
a lot of accusations and finger-pointing at specific political figures, 
but rather at a problem that we can all work together to address. 

Mr. McKay. Senator, I would like to comment, and I hope my 
comments are not taken as finger-pointing. I think the real serious 
problems on the Job Corps centers started when we dropped the re- 
quirements of input. That is to say, a student with a murder con- 
viction, which I have experienced, could come into the Job Corps 
program. I think this probably started the real downfall of the Job 
Corps program. 

Senator Abraham. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Abraham. 

Senator Kennedy has a follow-up comment. 

Senator Kennedy. Part of the ^lemma is that we are all looking 
for accountability. The purpose of these hearings on the jobs pro- 
gram is to try to find out, with the expenditure of billions of dol- 



133 

lars, is how good is the training program; does the young person 
or older person being trained really get skills; does the employer 
know about those skills so they can make a judgment; are those 
skills portable, so they can go to different places and find work; 
does the taxpayer know whether the programs are really good. We 
really do not do that very well, and the American people are not 
going to support it; if they do not know what they are getting, they 
are not going to support it, and they should not. 

Now we have a situation where, in the Job Corps, we require 
them to compile statistics on job placement, on further education, 
on GED attainment, on average reading and math gains, on job 
training match, on average wage upon entering employment, voca- 
tional completion rate, number of terminees per week, number of 
absences per day per student, number of significant incidences on 
the center, along with general financial information. We have re- 
quired all of these things to get it, and we are really not getting 
it. That is what you are telling us here. I think there is an honest 
desire to try to get it, to support those that are working, and to 
hold accountable or de-fund those that are not working. 

This is part of what we are trying to do, and after the hearing 
today, if you can think a little more, now that you have a better 
idea — and I am sure you had a good idea before the hearing — but 
if you have a better idea after listening to some of the questions, 
and if you could give us some additional information, working with 
our staffs, we would be very, very grateful. 

I want to thank all of you for your testimony. 

Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. I think it was just superb testimony. All four of 
you have added a gpreat deal to our understanding of the issues. As 
Senator Abraham said, and as I said at the beginning of this hear- 
ing yesterday, this is not a political issue. It is something which we 
are engaged in and a responsibility that I think Congress has in 
oversight, to try to solve some problems as things change, and as 
we need to be able to change with it to make things more account- 
able and more effective. All four of you have approached this with 
that interest, and I just want to assure you that I do think you 
have the attention of the Department of Labor, as well as the Con- 
gress, and out of that, I think we will find some answers. 

I appreciate very much your coming and thank you for being 
willing to share your thoughts with us this morning. 

I think we will go ahead and start with the second panel, even 
though there will be a vote at around 11:30. 

It is a pleasure to welcome the second panel, and I am sure you 
are pleased to be able to have a chance to offer your testimony this 
morning. 

Peter Rell is the director of the Job Corps Program at the De- 
partment of Labor, and Doug Ross is assistant secretary for em- 
ployment and training at the Department of Labor. 

Would you like to go first. Assistant Secretary?

STATEMENTS OF DOUG ROSS, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR 
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, 
WASHINGTON, DC; AND PETER RELL, DIRECTOR, JOB 
CORPS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, WASHINGTON, DC 

Mr. Ross. Thank you, Madam Chairman, Senator Kennedy, 
members of the committee, and my old Michigan colleague, Senator 
Abraham. 

I am indeed delighted to have this chance. You have raised im- 
portant questions, and I am eager to respond. I will briefly summa- 
rize my testimony and submit the full written statement for the 
record. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

Mr. Ross. Job Corps has really been a long-term bipartisan test, 
I think, of two critical propositions. The first is can a structured 
residential environment that focuses on individual responsibility 
and preparation for a job actually empower large numbers of our 
most disadvantaged young people to be able to turn their lives 
around and get off on a productive track. And the second, which 
has come up very much today, is a heavy reliance on the private 
sector rather than public bureaucracies, an effective way to deliver 
these relatively complex service to this at-risk group of young 
Americans. 

We think, looking at both the research and the stories of at this 
point hundreds of thousands of young people, that the answer to 
both of those is an emphatic yes. At the same time, Madam Chair- 
man, Secretary Reich and I agree with you that this is also a pro- 
gram that would benefit from some significant reform, and this is 
a topic I want to talk about with you today. 

First, we have sought to define a very clear and straightforward 
mission for Job Corps in the 1990&apos;s — I know that is an issue that 
you have raised — and that is to provide a disciplined environment 
where disadvantaged young people, whose lives are either going no- 
where or going the wrong way, can step up, have the chance to 
take responsibility for turning their lives around, and leave with a 
clear path to adulthood either in the form of a job or full-time post- 
secondary education that we think will lead to a iob. 

So the goals are likewise very clear: Jobs, further education, bet- 
ter incomes. That is how we want to measure all of this and deter- 
mine what success is. 

Now, by those standards, the first question is how are we doing. 
Well, of the 1.7 million young people whose lives have been touched 
by Job Corps over the last 30 years, 1.1 million, or 65 percent, have 
gone on to jobs or further education following their Job Corps expe- 
rience. The inspector general of the Department of Labor, who in 
fact has been a source of a lot of good suggestions for improving 
the Corps, testified I believe before this committee last week that 
Job Corps is in fact an important tool in helping disadvantaged 
young men and women turn their lives around and increase their 
economic earning power. 

In the first 6 months of this program year. Madam Chairman, 
nearly 75 percent of all students leaving the Corps for whatever 
reason, went into jobs or further full-time education. And of those 
getting jobs, 41 percent got jobs in areas directly related to their 



135 

vocational training and averaged more than $6.50 an hour in start- 
ing wage. 

Now, as for the question of return on investment — m other 
words, what is the real impact; do the benefits outweigh the costs — 
we believe that the current returns on the program are at least as 
great today as the $1.46 in benefits to society for every dollar in- 
vested that the Mathematic study documented in 1982. The reason 
we believe that is the performance measures that were used in that 
Mathematica study have in every case either remained steady or 
gotten better. The real costs of the program have remained con- 
stant since the late seventies, no real costs at all. And finally, what 
has happened to kids not going to Job Corps — ^high school dropouts 
in this country — in terms of their employment rate and their earn- 
ings, things have gotten markedly worse. So we believe the new 
Mathematics study which, as you know, is out there will show that 
we are doing as well, if not better. 

At the same time, some important questions have been raised 
about Job Corps that I believe are serious and deserve answers, 
and therefore, before closing I would like to just address three of 
them very briefly. 

One of the points that I think you have made very effectively. 
Madam Chairman, and Secretary Reich strongly agrees, is that we 
have to know what we are getting for these programs— not how 
many are enrolled in training, or how many are enrolled in this or 
that — ^the outcomes. How many are getting jobs? What are they 
earning? What are the wages, and what is the education? 

The measures we use to determine whether a Job Corps contrac- 
tor keeps a contract or not are primarily job placement, education 
fains, and wages. This length of stay is one of nine measures. We 
ave kept it, with the inspector general&apos;s support, because it is a 
good predictor. IF people think it gets in the way, we can get rid 
of it. You do not make more or less money, basically, around hold- 
ing people in; you make it finally in terms of what happens to kids. 
That is whether you keep a contract or not. 

The second issue, very quickly, is does Job Corps have a problem 
with violence at its centers. Now, again, in Job Corps, we start 
with the belief that any violence is unacceptable, that any level of 
violence above zero just is not acceptable. 

Job Corps does provide a level of safety that is substantially 
greater than the places disadvantaged kids come from or go back 
to — ^meaning the streets of our cities, our public schools, and our 
prisons. 

A couple quick facts. During the last full program year, there 
were no homicides committed on a Job Corps center in the Nation, 
and nine Job Corps residents were killed while off center, either 
while on leave or during a vacation break. So the homicide rate on 
Corps centers was zero. The rate for all Job Corps students — we in- 
clude those who went home and then met with death — was less 
than half the homicide rate for similar young people not in Job 
Corps. In fact, if you do it by 100,000 the way things are measured, 
it was about 28 per 100,000. In the city of Washington for kids that 
age, it is over 200 per 100,000. So Job Corps kids are substantially 
safer in their centers than living in their own neighborhoods. And 
when matched with public schools, you see the same thing. Two 



136 

percent of high school kids experience violence each year. On Job 
Corps centers, it is somewhat less than one percent. 

But, having said that, it is too much. One percent is one percent 
too much, which is the reason for this zero tolerance for violence 
policy initiated in June, which I hope we can talk about. 

The final question, I think, is: Has Job Corps responded quickly 
and thoroughly to the suggestions for improving the program 
raised by the OIG and enforced very effectively by yourself. Madam 
Chairman. 

I just want to announce that Job Corps has now taken strong ac- 
tion in virtually all of the areas for improvement identified by the 
IG, including concerns over low-performing centers, stronger per- 
formance measures, better match placement, and more extensive 
followup of students when they leave. 

In addition — and I will close now — working with the IG, we are 
proposing a set of bold reforms that I think will deal with many 
of the issues we have been talking about, including raising the age 
of Job Corps entrants, requiring students to be drug-free wnen they 
enter, establishing a 30-day probationary period during which time 
the student has to step up and make a very explicit commitment 
about his preparedness to do this and to give the center an oppor- 
tunity to get rid of the young person if they are not ready for it, 
with no effect at all on their performance, and also, legislative au- 
thority to be able to also deal with public centers. Government-run 
centers, that are not performing at an appropriate level so we can, 
in that case, bid those out. 

So we believe, bottom line, that Job Corps works to g^ve kids a 
chance at personal responsibility — it is not perfect, but we propose 
to make it better, and working together, we think we can. 

Thank you so much. 

Senator Kassebaum. Thank you, Mr. Ross. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ross may be found in the appen- 
dix.] 

The Chairman. Mr. Rell, I understand you do not have an open- 
ing statement, is that correct, and that you will just respond to 
questions? 

Mr. Rell. Yes, Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. 

Let me make a few comments. You have heard a lot, but I think 
there is a disturbing sort of trend that I want to question you 
about. 

Mr. Ross, perhaps it is important to State for those who do not 
know what the placement criteria are for Job Corps. 

Mr. Ross. The placement criterion is one of two things. 
Unsubsidized employment in the private sector — at this point, it 
has to be at least 20 hours a week, although we are raising the 
number to 32 hours shortly — or placement in further education 
which requires full-time attendance. So you either have to be in an 
unsubsidized job or in further education that requires full-time at- 
tendance in order to be considered placed. 

The Chairman. But placement is only tracked for 1 week; is that 
correct? 

Mr. Ross. Placement is only tracked for a brief period, but based 
on feedback from the IG and actually issues raised in your hearing 



137 

in October, we are now in the process of implementing a 13-week 
follow-up to see whether the person is still there, much the way we 
do in JTPA, and to make sure that counseling services continue to 
be available for up to 6 months. 

We are asking further for easier access to wage placement data 
and Social Security data, so we can do the kind of one-year or fur- 
ther follow-ups that Senator DeWine mentioned, which I think are 
very sensible. 

TTie Chairman. Yes. I am pleased that you are moving in that 
direction, because 1 week of placement does not, I think, make an 
outcomes-based record very useful or helpful to the young person 
if you are really trying to get data about what is happening. 

Mr. Ross. Right. Now, the Mathematica study, those longitudinal 
studies, followed young people for up to 4 years, so that when we 
talk about $1.46 back on $1, it is after people have been followed — 
but we need to do it for each kid on an ongoing basis; I could not 
agree more. 

The Chairman. What has really troubled me a great deal is the 
violence that we keep hearing about. You spoke of a disciplined en- 
vironment, and it seems to me that what we are hearing more and 
more is that it is not a disciplined environment, that we have situ- 
ations now where it is not a correctional environment, either, and 
yet more and more young people unfortunately are coming as court 
referrals. Should they be handled in a different way — and I think 
that was a comment made by the first panel — in sort of a separate, 
boot camp environment, first, before training, and there has to be 
something there, in a very disciplined, structured environment. 

You say that zero tolerance is in place, but we have heard in tes- 
timony that indeed this really is not working very well. So I would 
like to explore with you a little bit about that. 

The inspector general has reported the high dropout rates, 50 
percent in the first 6 months. There are some who would attribute 
this to an atmosphere that exists there, and that they do not wish 
to remain in that atmosphere. To what would you attribute the 
dropout rate? 

Mr. Ross. To begin with your question about whether it should 
be run as a correctional place, or as a place where you can get 
training and other learning opportunities to move forward — I think 
in our minds, that is clear. It is the latter; its purpose is not correc- 
tional. Students who have serious criminal backgrounds should not 
be admitted, and we in fact are proposing that as evidence of a real 
commitment to step up and take personal responsibility, if you are 
not drug-free, you should be referred to a place where you can get 
drug-fi-ee and oe allowed admission only when you are drug-free. 

The reason, I think, for the dropout rate is this. Job Corps, if you 
do not have a serious criminal record, has open admissions. It says 
if you think you are ready to step up and take responsibility tot 
turning vour life aroimd, you are welcome in, and here are the 
terms. If you live by them, you can succeed; if you do not, you will 
have to leave. 

More than 8,000 young people were asked to leave last year 
alone because they could not meet the disciplinary standards. 

In reality, 30 percent leave in the first 90 days. As you know. 
Madam Chairman, in terms of community college population, kids 



138 

who sign up for 2-year programs, associates degrees, more than 60 
percent drop out before getting to the second year. In 4-year uni- 
versities, more than 45 percent drop out before getting their B.A.S. 
This is fairly thought. You have got to be ready to do it. We think 
that by eliminating younger entrants, 16-year-olds, and beginning 
to reduce the number of 17-year-olds, we will also have a larger 
population that is ready to step up and take the responsibility £md 
make something of this opportunity. 

The Chairman. But by increasing that age limit, aren&apos;t you also 
missing an ever younger level of population that is dropping out? 

Mr. Ross. We think that between JTPA, school-to-work, and the 
Title II-B and II-C programs, there is in fact an effort to keep those 
young people closer to home and get them connected up with local 
learning, because as you have said, one of our goals is job place- 
ment, and even if you give a 16-year-old pretty decent vocational 
training, in many cases, they are not really ready yet, or legally 
cannot even go out and get good full-time jobs in the private sector. 

The Chairman. And I can accept that. I think again, though, it 
speaks to this uncertain purpose that has evolved perhaps over the 
last 8 to 10 years. We are not quite sure what population we want 
to serve or how. 

Going back to the fact that the high dropout rate reflects, you are 
saying, the strict discipline and requirements that exist there, as 
you know, that was one of the questions that was raised when Sen- 
ator Kerrey of Nebraska and myself sent a letter to you, raising the 
concerns that we had, and one of them was the high dropout rate, 
and you reflected at the time that you believed it was because of 
strict discipline and behavioral codes. This response was sent to all 
of the Members of Congress at that time. 

Does the Department of Labor still believe that that is the case 
and that violence as we have seen reported has nothing to do with 
it? 

Mr. Ross. I would never say that. 

The Chairman. I mean, we have heard students say they have 
left because it is not an environment they want to be in. 

Mr. Ross. I would never say that violence is not an issue. Job 
Corps is still part of America. The kids come from America, and the 
Job Corps centers are located in America; and America at this 
point is sadly a country beset by an enormous amount of violence 
involving its young people. 

Job Corps centers are safer places than the streets and schools 
our young people come from, but we are not there yet. And by the 
way, the zero tolerance policy, started in June, doesn&apos;t mean yet 
that there is zero violence. It means that there is a renewed com- 
mitment to face up to all situations where any act of violence oc- 
curs, to make sure it is dealt with, to encourage — as has been hap- 
pening and was mentioned by previous panelists — the fact that 
when young people show by their behavior that they are not ready 
to live by the code, you have to ask them to leave. 

The Chairman. Mr. Rell, let me just follow through a bit on this. 
It is my understanding that on June 10th of last year, you sent a 
memo on violence to all the Job Corps regional directors and the 
center directors. And in the memo, you state: &quot;The evidence sug- 



139 

gests that the gp-eatest single factor causing students to leave our 
program early is violence.&quot; 

Mr. Rell. Yes, ma&apos;am. 

The Chairman. Do you believe that that is the case? 

Mr. Rell. I think it is. 

The Chairman. Do you and Mr. Ross agree on this? 

Mr. Rell. We are not inconsistent, Senator, I do not believe. The 
strict requirements that we have on Job Corps centers include no 
violence. So that when young people cannot accommodate them- 
selves to a disciplined environment and to the requirements that 
are established, part of their failure to accommodate themselves is 
committing acts of violence. So I do not believe the two things are 
at all inconsistent. 

Over the past several years. Madam Chairman, the level of vio- 
lence in our society has increased, the students we receive have 
been exposed to more violence, drugs have increased. Our popu- 
lation has indeed changed, and our problem has gotten tougher. 
That is why we have had to move and make changes in the pro- 
gram as we moved along. 

We have added substance abuse counselors in an effort to ad- 
dress the substance abuse problem. We have become convinced at 
this point that the problem in that area is so great that we do not 
have the adequate resources to address it properly. As Mr. Ross 
mentioned, we have come to the conclusion that what we need to 
do is we need to require young people, as a sign of their commit- 
ment to changing their lives, to become drug-free prior to enroll- 
ment. 

With regard to the violence aspect, we noticed an increase in vio- 
lence not only in the general society, but unfortunately, in the Job 
Corps centers as well. That is why I sent that policy directive last 
June to implement a zero tolerance for violence policy and to make 
it clear to the centers that that was the policy and that that is 
what needed to be enforced. And that is part of the discipline envi- 
ronment, and that is part of the requirements that young people 
need to live by. If they do not choose to live by that, then they must 
leave. 

Mr. Ross. And contractors who are not able to establish that en- 
vironment, we have simply moved to terminate those contracts. So 
we are holding both the contractors of centers, both public and pri- 
vate, and the young people themselves. 

The Chairman. Following along that line, let me ask you — ^be- 
cause as you may know, we started the hearing yesterday with a 
videotape of the McKinney Center in Dallas. My understanding is 
that the center operator there was terminated; is that correct? 

Mr. Ross. That is correct. 

The Chairman. Could you just describe for us, given the fact that 
you say that this is something you are following through on, how 
that termination was handled, and was this a mutual agreement 
of the parties? 

Mr, Ross, It was done this way. Whenever we get any evidence 
in addition to our own monitoring find reports that behavior is not 
being maintained at appropriate standards, we immediately move 
in and attempt to determine what in fact is going on. 



140 

There is a center run by the National Park Service in North 
Carolina, and some parents had given us some information that 
there was violence on that center. We checked it out — there was no 
media involved in that — and stopped sending young people there, 
because we cannot, unlike the gentleman here saiid, currently bid 
out a Grovemment center that is not meeting standards. Tliat is not 
allowed under the JTPA amendments. 

The case of Wackenhut was, as you showed, a television report. 
So we went and checked it out. I nave three tests, Madam Chair- 
man, and then I will tell you exactly what we did. No. 1 is was the 
report on television — since I could not verify it one way or another, 
directly — was it part of a pattern of difficulty on that center? Ana 
the answer to that was yes; they had been struggling with poor 
performance reports for some period. 

Second, when I confronted tnem with what they were going to do 
about that, they were not able to provide an answer that I think 
I could have come before you or anybody else and convincingly said, 
&quot;Keep this contract in place.&quot; 

And third, I have to ask the question, if there were an extended 
member of my family — much the way the gentleman talked about 
the people he was placing here — given what I had known — I read 
all the incident reports — ^would I be comfortable sending that mem- 
ber of my family to that center? The answer was no. 

Wackenhut, the contractor, was given 10 days to show cause why 
we should not terminate their contract. We were not persuaded. 
They said, look, let us just do it voluntarily. We are willing to just 
work out an agreement with you so there is no litigation or any- 
thing; we will just terminate it, and you can turn it over to another 
contractor. 

We agreed. Another contractor should be selected by early Feb- 
ruary, and the trsmsition will occur at the end of March. 

The Chairman. Was Wackenhut penalized or sanctioned in any 
way? Do they have other centers that they still operate? 

Mr. Ross. They have two other centers that they operate. The re- 
sults of this and the performance here, if they choose to compete 
to continue any of those centers, will be part of the record. You are 
judged on your performance not only at the center you are bidding 
for, but other centers you have operated elsewhere. 

The Chairman. My time is up, and I thank you. 

Senator Kennedy? 

Senator Kennedy. Thank you very much, Mr. Ross. We appre- 
ciate your presence here. 

At the outset, I will say that I am a strong believer in this whole 
effort to try to really give these young people a second chance. As 
you point out in your testimony, 80 percent are high school drop- 
outs; 40 percent come from families on public assistance; 70 per- 
cent have never had a full-time job; most come from neighborhoods 
plagued by high rates of unemployment, crime, welfare and illit- 
eracy. Ana it is very easy for us to sit up here and sharpshoot and 
flyspeck this program. And if you read that outline 20 years ago, 
it would be a different kind of kid who falls into this program. We 
are mindful of that. 

Having said that, however, I think we have to really ask our- 
selves whether you are getting the full information about what is 



141 

really happening out there. I have been impressed with many 
things that Sarge Shriver did, but one of the things he did in the 
Peace Corps when they set it up was to have five investigative re- 
porters go around in the Peace Corps and find out where the prob- 
lems were before the press found out about them, so they were able 
to make some changes. 

And I would just suggest to you that you develop within that pro- 
-am of yours the kind of tough-minded review of these kinds of 
issues that we have heard today, as well as others. You have heard 
it, and you can evaluate it. We listen to it, and some of this makes 
some sense, but you have to look at it against the total review. And 
you ought to be able to rely not just on the IG, and not just on the 
proclamations or issuing the recommendations, or asking for this 
kind of assessment or that kind of review, but really finding out 
what is going on out there, because I think you can get the feeling 
that this whole program is targeted now, and those who believe 
and understand that this is an important effort to try to reach out 
to these young people must be able to respond to these kinds of 
questions that have been raised. 

One of the things that this committee is looking at is how you 
are going to tie together various kinds of training programs. You 
have very similar kinds of kids in JTPA II-C, very similar in terms 
of disadvantaged kids — a somewhat different profile, but not great- 
ly different. In the School-to-Work program, some of those efforts 
that were passed last year were to reach out to the kids who have 
dropped out of school, maybe recently dropped out, both to get 
them into the School-to-Work program and to help them to be able 
to go on. You have Tech Prep, and other kinds of programs out 
there, and I think what we are really looking at now is how to find 
ways that we can have some coordination, working closely together 
ana maximizing these local kinds of neighborhood initiatives, 
which I think are taking place; I know they are in many of the 
communities in my State, with Mayor Manino&apos;s strong emphasis on 
neighborhoods, where you are working with local businesses, with 
local educators, and with local law enforcement people to really do 
something. 

So we need your recommendations. This program cannot live, I 
think, just in and of itself. It has to be linked in some kind of rela- 
tionship with these others, and how that is going to work is really 
what we are looking for in this committee. 

You talk about defunding some of these programs. How many 
have you defunded because of the violence element? 

Mr. Ross. First of all, since we established this policy in June, 
a North Carolina center run by the U.S. Park Service was not 
meeting stamdards, and we could not defund them, but we cut off 
students, and we said, &quot;Until we are satisfied, you get no more stu- 
dents.&quot; Wackenhut, we cut off, because they were not able to main- 
tain the environment. The Cleveland center — we went out and 
dropped in on 28 centers, not quite as deftly as Sargeant Shriver 
did it — and we had a meeting with him some time ago, and I know 
he really did it very well, and that is a good model, by the way, 
I happen to believe — ^we dropped in on 28 centers, and at Cleve- 
land, we were not comfortable, and we terminated their contract. 
We told the Park Service — ^they are running four centers — that in 



142 

terms of behavior among our 20 worst ones, we asked them to show 
cause why we should not take those centers and give them over to 
some other part of the Government. 

Senator Kennedy. OK, We have got a vote, but I was trying to 
take the IG report and also your response to this. I would have 
liked to have seen it be more responsive to what the IG has talked 
about, and the changes that are being made and what is really 
happening out there. 

We heard some criticism just in terms of the privatization, and 
the financial pressures of keeping kids on; you heard those today. 
I do not know how much weight to give that, and I would like to 
hear you talk about some of those kinds of difficulties. 

I think what we really want to see is a tough hands-on policy. 
I know that that is your background, being very, very successful in 
the private sector and involved in public policy. And I also want to 
pay tribute to Mr. Rell, who has spent a lifetime in commitment 
to this. 

So I think that now is really the time that people are going to 
be looking for this kind of accountability, and just having the lists 
and the statistics, we do not know, obviously, whether that in and 
of itself is responding to the kinds of things that are really happen- 
ing out there, and we need your guidance, your help, your oversight 
and your tough-mindedness in trying to make this the kind of pro- 
gram that will have support. 

Mr. Ross. I know you have to go vote. I just want to say that 
the last thing I want to do is come before you in any defensive 
fashion. I care desperately, as do the Secretary and the rest of us, 
that this really work. It is not a question of trying to put out statis- 
tics. We do think a lot of good results are being achieved. We are 
very open and are trying to be very bold and imaginative in terms 
of ways to take it a quantum leap forward. Nothing is sacred in 
this. We are willing to change what needs to be changed. 

I think the key thing is, ultimately, the human beings; is this 
really a chance to turn your life around? That is what needs to 
drive it, Eind your comments are extremely well-taken. 

Senator Kennedy. Thank you. 

Thank you. Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. Senator Simon, do you want to try to ask some- 
thing now, or shall we go and vote and come back? 

Senator Simon. I think maybe we ought to vote, and I hate to 
ask them to wait. 

Mr. Ross. We would be happy to wait. This is very important. 

The Chairman. If you do not mind waiting, we will come back. 

The committee stands in recess for 15 minutes. 

[Recess.] 

The Chairman. The hearing will resume. 

Senator Simon? 

Senator Simon. Thank you, and I thank the witnesses for stay- 
ing. We have little control over when the votes are cast and that 
sort of thing. 

Let me just summarize some impressions that I have from wit- 
nesses yesterday and today — and unfortunately, I was tied up the 
day before and was not able to be here. One is that generally 
speaking, the Grovernment-run programs operate pretty well. Those 



143 

that are contracted out, some do very well, as we heard from St. 
Paul, MN yesterday, and some do not do well. Generally, the small- 
er programs are more successful than the large programs, and 
where you can have a residential program that is in a different set- 
ting from where people live, that generally is better. 

I would add that I get a little concerned when I hear questions 
of you and responses from you geared only to job placement. When 
you have 41 percent iob placement, it does not mean that the Job 
Corps is unsuccessful for the other 59 percent. You are giving a 
spark of hope to a lot of people who have just given up in our soci- 
ety, and we have too many people who have given up. 

What I do not want to see happen is — we had the CETA pro- 
gram, and there were some deficiencies in that program; then we 
shifted to JTPA, and we were so anxious to provide measurable 
success stories that there was a &quot;creaming&quot; — where they had a 
choice of getting a high school graduate or a high school dropout, 
they took the high school graduate into the JTPA program because 
you could show better results at the end. 

I think Senator Kassebaum&apos;s suggestion for follow-up is good, 
and I would like to see follow-up not just a month later or 6 
months later; I would like to see it a year later, and on two ele- 
ments. One is jobs or education, and the second is what is the rate 
of incarceration, because there will be some of these young people 
who will be in prison at that point. What kind of comparison is it 
for those who went into this program and a similar kind of group 
outside? 

We are dealing with what one police officer yesterday called &quot;bor- 
derline&quot; young people — good kids, potentially, but who for a variety 
of reasons have had problems. 

I was just talking with Karen Anderson, from St. Paul, who was 
a witness yesterday, a great witness. She says there are manv 
more success stories than there are failures in Job Corps. I think 
that that is something to keep in mind as we focus, understand- 
ably, on how we can improve the program. 

The one question that I am concerned about is when you have 
a private contractor who takes over a program in Kansas or Illinois 
or anywhere, we heard yesterday people saying, &quot;We do not want 
to get rid of students, because there is a profit in keeping them 
there.&quot; Is that the case? Should it be restructured so that what we 
are interested in is not so many bodies, but really doing the job? 
Are we getting the right impression or the wrong impression here? 

Mr. Ross. That is a good question. Senator. The reality is there 
is no&apos; sort of &quot;bodies for bucks&quot; incentive or provision in any of this. 
I believe you have a center operator from one of the better centers 
on your next panel, and I believe she can explain that. 

Senator SiMON. Can you explain how you contract? Let us say I 
am going to sign a contract with you. How am I paid? 

Mr. Ross. OK. Why don&apos;t you explain the payment process, and 
then let me explain why it does not create an incentive simply to 
hold onto people who ought to be gotten rid of, that there is no 
profit in that. 

Mr. Rell. Senator, the contracts are cost reimbursement con- 
tracts where the contractor is reimbursed for the actual expenses 
of operating the center. There is also a profit. It is called a &quot;fixed 



144 

fee,&quot; and it is fixed. The amount of profit, Senator, does not vary 
depending on how many people are on-center or whether there are 
400 or 380 or any of those things. &quot;Bodies for bucks&quot; is not the 
method of payment. 

Mr. Ross. So what it means is you get this contract. The number 
of people on site does not affect the profitability of the site. The key 
for a contractor is to be able, after 2 years of getting the contract, 
to get renewals for up to 3 additional years and then in bidding to 
keep it and to be able to win that competition. And that is deter- 
mined primarily by output measures such as the percentage who 
get jobs, the percentage who go on to further education on a full- 
time basis, those who get a GED, those who realize reading and 
math gains. 

So holding someone who is disrupting everybody else and keep- 
ing them from learning tmd advancing works against your ability. 
There is no finsincial incentive to keep around disruptive young 
people, period. 

Mr. Rell. May I add one thing. Senator? 

Senator Simon. Yes. 

Mr. Rell. There are nine performance standards for Job Corps 
centers. Mr. Ross enumerated about seven of them. There are two 
additional ones. One is the average length of stay, which has been 
the subject of some discussion. Senator. That is the only process 
measure in there, and the reason why it is there is because every 
piece of research that has ever been done says that there is a direct 
correlation between the achievements in academics, in placement, 
in the levels of jobs that you get and the wages that you earn, and 
how long you stay. 

You have to stay in the center in order to learn. That is the one 
standard that is a process standard. If that is confusing or trouble- 
some to someone, we can draft that standard, because if you ask 
any of the center directors — and I think you have one on the next 
panel — I am sure they will tell you that in order to achieve those 
learning gains, get that GED, complete the vocational training and 
obtain a job, kids have to stay there long enough to learn, and they 
know how to do that. 

Senator Simon. And when you say there are nine criteria, is av- 
erage length of stay weighed more heavily than the other eight cri- 
teria? 

Mr. Rell. No, sir. It is one of nine criteria. 

Senator Simon. All right. You also mentioned that you give 2- 
year contracts. Someone who has never done this before — does that 
person or corporation or whatever it is get a 2-year contract the 
first time, or do you give them a one-year contract the first time, 
just to see whether they can perform? 

Mr. Ross. The basic process is that you compete, and you com- 
pete with others, and if you win, you get a contract for a 2-year 
time. We are also now moving to put in place a provision which al- 
lows us to terminate even within that 2 years, if there is a rea- 
son — we have been doing that, but this will allow us to do it even 
more quickly — and then, after the 2 years, there are 3 option years 
at the discretion of Job Corps. If we do not think you have done 
a good enough job, or have done a mediocre job, we will then say 



145 

no option years; let us put the operation of this center back out for 
bidding. 

Senator Simon. And in that first year — and I know my time is 
up, Madam Chairman — but in that first year, is there a particu- 
larly intensive look at the kind of job that someone is doing? 

Mr. Rell. Yes, Senator. We conduct annual onsite reviews of the 
Job Corps centers with teams of experienced people — depending on 
the size of the center, anywhere from five to ten people — for a week 
at a time, including in the evening and on weekends and so on. 
Those reviews are carefully timed so that you can have the results 
of those reviews when it is time to make a decision about contract- 
ing. 

On a 2-year contract, you have to make that decision about 14 
months into it, because until somebody completely reinvents the 
procurement regulations, it takes about 8 months to conduct a com- 
petitive procurement. 

Senator Simon. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and I thank both 
of you. 

The Chairman. Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

I would like to get some basic facts on the record, but not just 
on the record, so I can understand. Is it my understanding, Mr. 
Ross, that the last longitudinal study was done in 1982? 

Mr. Ross. The last longitudinal study was completed in 1982; 
that is correct, sir. 

Senator DeWine. Is my understanding correct that there is a 
current study ongoing that you would say would be a longitudinal 
study — and Dy that, I mean simply that I know what percentage 
in 6 months or in 12 months actually have jobs and where they 
are. 

Mr. Ross. Actually, it follows young people for 4 years against 
a control group of similar young people who did not have a Job 
Corps experience. 

Senator DeWine. And when would we expect the completion of 
that, and when would we expect the preliminary report? 

Mr, Ross. The completion, I believe, will be around 1997 because 
of the tracking. That is my understanding. 

Mr. Rell. I believe that is correct. Senator. 

Senator DeWine. Will we get interim numbers, though? 

Mr. Ross. I do not think so, not to my knowledge. What was in- 
teresting is 

Senator DeWine. That is a long time to wait — and I understand 
it is good to have a long time; please do not misunderstand me. 

Mr. Ross. OK. Pete may correct me on that. 

Senator DeWine. My point is that I think it would be very help- 
ful for a program that is costing over $1 billion a year to have these 
figures after a year, after a year and a half, 2 years. 

Mr. Ross. Why don&apos;t you answer that, Pete, and then let me ex- 
plain other things that we are doing so that we do not have to wait 
until we have that fully. 

Mr. Rell. Senator, the follow-up period — that the independent 
evaluation firm is conducting — the follow-up period is 12 months, 
30 months, and 48 months. We will have some interim reports, ob- 
viously, from the contractor as they gather and analyze that data. 



146 

I would suggest, however, that the 12-month follow-up point does 
not tell you a whole lot, but it is better than nothing. 

Senator DeWine. Mr. Rell, it tells me a whole lot more than I 
have had for 12 years. This program has been operating now, and 
we have not had any longitudinal study since 1982, so in all fair- 
ness, it is going to tell us a whole lot more than we have right now. 

Mr. Rell. There will be those interim reports at those follow-up 
points. 

Senator DeWine. And when would we expect that first one, then, 
because I do not know when the study started. 

Mr. Rell. The study started in November of last year. 

Senator DeWine. November of 1994; is that right? 

Mr. Rell. Yes, sir. 

Senator DeWine. So we could expect something toward the close 
of this year. 

Mr. Rell. Early 1996, 1 would suspect. 

The Chairman. Senator, would you yield? 

Senator DeWine. I will. 

The Chairman. I believe I am correct that this study is $13 mil- 
lion? 

Mr. Rell. I believe that is correct. 

Mr. Ross. That is the reason we do not do them more frequently. 
But what we are attempting to do now 

Senator DeWine. Oh, I understand. 

The Chairman. That was my point, Mr. Ross. 

Mr. Ross [continuing]. That does not require waiting, because 
the information you are asking for is critical. 

Senator DeWine. Yes, I understand. Also, Mr. Ross, it would 
seem to me there is some interim between $13 million and doing 
nothing for 12 years. One of the difficulties I have is when I talk 
to directors, they can tell me how many were placed at one point 
in time, they can tell me how many were placed in a job that is 
specific to their training, but if I ask, well, where are they in 6 
weeks, or where are they in 6 months, or where are they in 12 
months, I get nothing. And I do not think that that is their fault. 
I think it is the fault of how the program is being run, that no one 
is asking them to supply those statistics. 

Mr. Ross. We are asking them now. 

Senator DeWine. OK. Tell me how we are going to get that. 

Mr. Ross. In two ways. First, we have been piloting in New Eng- 
land, and will ultimately now spread to the full country, an auto- 
matic follow-up of 13 weeks, of checking where that individual is 
13 weeks later, and continuing to make counseling available to 
them over a 6-month period after they have gotten their initial 
placement. Second, we are going to be asking the committee and 
Congress for legislative authority to get more direct access to wage 
record data and Social Security data, so as an ongoing matter, we 
can check after 1 year or after 2 years. 

Now, that will only tell us what is happening to these young peo- 
ple, which is critically important. It still will not answer the ques- 
tion as to what is the impact relative to young people who have not 
been through the program. For that, you are left with the kind of 
random selection, Mathematica studies. But the other kind, we are 



147 

going to be able to begin providing for you in the months imme- 
diately ahead. 

Senator DeWine. Let me turn to another question that has come 
out in the testimony, and that is what I would characterize as a 
disconnect between the recruitment for an individual, then the 
training, the education, then the job placement. It seems to me we 
are talking about three different components. 

For example, in Dayton, OH, it is my understanding that when 
individuals are recruited, they are recruited by a national group, 
and there is no concerted effort in the Dayton community to target 
people from Dayton who might qualify; there is some, but there is 
not a concerted effort. There is a national group that runs that, a 
national contractor. Then, when the person comes out, or is getting 
ready to try to find a job, they are dealing again with the national 
group. 

So I would like you to address that. It seems to me, as a person 
who is really just looking at this based on the testimony in the last 
few days and the information I have been able to obtain, that that 
is a disconnect, and it seems a strange way to run the operation. 

Mr. Ross. Senator, when I first saw it — because coming here less 
than 2 years ago, I was fairly new to Job Corps — ^it looked a bit 
strange to me. The way it works is this. Many States only have a 
single center. Some States have no center at all. So let us take 
Dayton. Dayton, in order to be used appropriately, requires the at- 
tracting of young people from all over, not just Dayton. Well, if the 
Dayton center has to hire people in Cleveland, in Columbus, in 
Cincinnati as well as Dayton, not to mention rural areas and other 
parts of the Midwest, there are no scale economies. For every, sin- 
gle center to have a major recruitment system of its own becomes 
prohibitively expensive. 

It is the same with placement. Let us say I am from Cleveland, 
and I come to your Dayton center. I get a terrific opportunity, and 
I use it. I want to go oack to Cleveland now; that is where I am 
from. I need someone connected to the Cleveland labor market who 
can hook me up. 

But you are right — the question then is that the people doing the 
training and the people doing the placement do not seem to nave 
a shared responsibility. So what we have now done and have put 
in place — it has been for some time now — ^is both the center opera- 
tor in Dayton and the placement resource in Cleveland are both 
held accountable for the placement of that young person, so they 
both have a terrific incentive to work together and cooperate to 
make sure it is effective. 

So we are talking about how you make a national system effi- 
cient, because kids come from all over. In many cases, maybe they 
will say, &apos;The last place I want to go back to is Cleveland. I came 
from gangs, I have got family problems there. I need a new start. 
Dayton was a new start. Get me into a different place. Send me 
down South. Send me out West.&quot; With the current setup, we can 
do that. 

Senator DeWine. I see my time is up. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

Mr. Rell, you have been Job Corps director since 1984. 

Mr. Rell. I believe it has been since 1983, Senator. 



148 

The Chairman. Excuse me — 1983. So you have seen a lot of 
changes take place, and there are a couple of things I would like 
to ask about and then just a final comment. 

One, in the contracting, placement and/or recruitment, isn&apos;t it 
true that Job Corps contracts separate for recruitment and place- 
ment? It is not the center contract that does that. You contract 
under another contract; is that correct? 

Mr. Rell. That is correct. Senator. The contracts for operating 
the Job Corps centers are indeed different from the contracts for 
outreach screening and placement. The outreach screening and 
placement contracts are organized by geographic area, whereas the 
centers are not evenly spread in all of the States, so the match is 
not exact. 

For example, there are six Job Corps centers in Kentucky. There 
is one placement contract for the entire State of Kentucky. 

The Chairman. Pardon me. Why should there be six in Ken- 
tucky? 

Mr. Ross. You do not have to answer that question. I will protect 
him as a civil servant. [Laughter.] I think it could have been the 
political configuration of the Congress at some time in the past. Is 
that a fair statement? 

Senator Kennedy. It is called Carl Perkins. 

Mr. Ross. Yes. Thank you, Senator. [Laughter.] 

Mr. Rell. I am sorry. I wandered into that one. 

The Chairman. Sorry; I should have known before I asked. 

Let me just ask you, then, doesn&apos;t that set up, however, some — 
it goes along with what Senator DeWine was asking, to a certain 
extent. We get a disconnect between recruitment and — we have 
been hearing that where you have smaller centers, where you have 
a community that is involved, those tend to be centers that are 
working better. Why have something where you have to go outside 
in order to get numoers to bring into the center? And I think there 
is a certain percentage paid in your contract to those who are con- 
tracting for recruitment as well as who receive a contract for place- 
ment. Is that not correct? 

Mr. Rell. That is correct. Senator. The recruitment and place- 
ment contracts are currently fixed-unit price contracts. That is, you 
get paid one price per arrival. That is to cover all of the outreach 
and all of the screening for however msiny people you need to con- 
tact and screen in order to have that one arrival. 

And you are right about the disconnect. We have taken steps to 
link the two organizations better. Because of the geography, it is 
not always possible to have the Job Corps center itself be its own 
recruiter and placer, because of geographic coverages. 

But our challenge is to link the Job Corps centers more closely 
with the outreach screening and placement agencies. We have 
taken a number of steps in that direction. One of the primary ones 
is that the incentives and the standards need to be the same. Right 
now, the performance standards for placement agencies are iden- 
tical to the performance standards for the Job Corps centers — the 
very same standards, the same kind, and the like. 

Administrative arrangements to make a better connection, to 
work together and transfer information have also been put into 
place. 



149 

One of the criticisms that the inspector general levied — and it is 
a correct one, Senator — was that we lost track of 25 percent of the 
students who left the Job Corps centers in 1990. That was a dis- 
connect between the centers and the placement contractors. That 
problem has been, if not fully solved, I believe, addressed. This 
year, 12 percent are missing. We have been unable to locate 12 per- 
cent after they left the center and went back to their home commu- 
nities or wherever. I hope to get that percentage down into the sin- 
gle digits by the end of this progpram year. 

The Chairman. Mr. Rell, one other thing that I find troubling 
is — we have talked about zero tolerance, and this is a policy that 
now, all of a sudden, you are initiating with some vengeance, evi- 
dently. 

I worry — and I think we are going to have to work together, 
again, on exactly what it is we hope to do with Job Corps, because 
if we are trying to serve disadvantaged youth, disadvantaged youth 
today are coming with different problems than they came with 
when the program started 30 years ago. And I would really hate 
to see us get into &quot;creaming,&quot; 

I think to say that a student should come drug-free is one thing. 
I think they should take the responsibility to tryr to get there, but 
I also feel even more strongly that it is up to tne management of 
the center to make sure drugs are not sold at the center. 

Mr. Rell. Absolutely, 

The Chairman, So if we somehow start to take youth and sav 
they have to be drug-free, we are not living up to our responsibil- 
ity, or those who are managing the centers, to make sure an atmos- 
phere is being provided that allows them to begin to turn their 
lives around. And as we have heard more and more, why go from 
the street, where it has been unsafe, to a center that provides 
somewhat the same environment? 

I really do not want to see just the figures show that somehow 
we have zero tolerance. That does not really matter to me. What 
matters to me is strong discipline that provides the kind of envi- 
ronment in which we can turn lives around, 

Mr, Rell. I could not agree with you more. Senator. And the in- 
tent of the zero tolerance policy is to create and enforce that kind 
of environment. And it has not done so in terms of statistics. Sta- 
tistics are not the issue. The zero tolerance policy is intended to en- 
sure that all center staff&quot; address all acts of violence and deal with 
them appropriately. 

The way to have a safe center is to make sure that both the staff&quot; 
and the students buy into that, that they understand that that is 
the expectation cmd that there are consequences for not abiding by 
that. The consequences for the students are that if they do not 
want to buy into it, they will lose their opportunity for being at 
that center, and the consequences for the center operator are that 
they will no longer be operating the center. 

The Chairman. Was that in place at the McKinney center? 

Mr. Rell. Our zero tolerance policy was announced in June. Our 
review at the McKinney center showed that it was not well-imple- 
mented. We have done follow-up and review of 28 centers, as Mr. 
Ross mentioned earlier, and we will be following up on the rest of 
them by March, Out of those 28 centers, we were dissatisfied with 



150 

eight, and two of those, very dissatisfied, as Mr. Ross mentioned, 
McKinney and one in Cleveland, where we changed center opera- 
tors. 

The Chairman. And the center operator who was at McKinney 
also operates the Guthrie center in Guthrie, OK, which has had a 
number of violations, and I assume that that one is under review 
as well? 

Mr. Rell, It is. Senator. The Guthrie center has been reviewed, 
and it was not satisfactory; it was one of the eight that I mentioned 
that was not satisfactory, and there are specific steps that have 
been required and are being taken, and my staff are on-center on 
a regular basis. Senator, at Guthrie to ensure that they are fol- 
lowed through. 

The Chairman. Well, I welcome — and I think the whole panel 
does — the opportunity to work together, because I feel that it is a 
responsibility we all have to make this successful. I appreciate your 
testimony this morning. I think we have a lot ahead of us to do 

Mr. Ross. We do. 

The Chairman [continuing]. And I look forward to working to- 
gether. And I would just suggest not a State of denial that there 
are problems, but help us — ^help us in a realistic fashion; be honest 
about what is out there and what we can do. 

Mr. Ross. If I could — I am speaking here for Secretary Reich as 
well — we would very much like over the next 6 months, based both 
on the things that we have worked out in agreement with the IG, 
but also to sit down with your staffs and yourselves to get further 
ideas, to see if we cannot be very comfortable that by July 1, we 
have in fact dealt to our mutual satisfaction with areas that we 
think are very much in need of improvement. We would look for- 
ward to that very much. Madam Chair. 

The Chairman. Well, I appreciate it, because we have tried, you 
know, and like some of the testimony we heard earlier, we have not 
always had as much success being heard as we would like; and per- 
haps this hearing will help clear the air for everyone. 

Senator Kennedy? 

Senator Kennedy. If you would perhaps respond to some of the 
items that have been raised as part of the record; I think you ought 
to be given a chance to react. Some of those things might have 
been cleared up and steps taken. I think it would be valuable just 
to have a complete record. 

Mr. Ross. Yes. 

Senator Kennedy. And I think there were some suggestions 
made by other panelists, and we would like to have your reaction 
to those as well. I think the point is that we all want to try to have 
the opportunity of working together. I think that that is very clear 
across the line here, and your willingness and the administration&apos;s 
willingness to involve itself in an intense kind of way I think is 
very positive and very good news. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Senator DeWine had another question. 

Senator DEWnsfE. Thank you. 

Mr. Ross, let me follow up on the issue of the placement of the 
individuals as they come out of the program. How is that handled 



151 

as far as the money for the contractor? Is that per individual 
placed? Mr. Rell? 

Mr. Rell. Yes, sir. 

Senator DeWine. And how much is that? 

Mr. ^LL. It varies. They are competitive contracts, Senator, so 
it would vary by individual contract competition. 

Senator DeWine. What would the range be? 

Mr. Rell. It would average around $400. 

Senator DeWine. Around $400. And to get that $400 as the con- 
tracting agency, what do I have to do? What is the result that I 
have to show? 

Mr. Rell. You have to verify that an individual has either en- 
rolled full-time in school or has entered onto a job, and you need 
to check at least 1 week after he has actually been there. 

Senator DeWine. So my incentive is to help that person either 
continue his or her education or get a job — and that can be any job, 
is that right? 

Mr. Rell. That is correct, Senator. 

Senator DeWine. OK. That can be any job that lasts at least a 
week. In other words, all I have to show is that it did in fact last 
a week. 

Mr. Rell. Yes. This is entered employment; it is not follow-up at 
all. The only significance of the week is that you have to verify that 
it actually happened, that the individual actually entered onto the 
job, so that it is not prospective, that he tells you he has got a job. 

Senator DeWine. Has there ever been any thought given to cre- 
ating possibly a dual system, where the contract agency gets so 
much if that person gets the job, which we all know is very impor- 
tant — getting them into the labor market — ^but then gets so much 
more as a bonus if they can verify that that person has a job in 
3 months, or that the employment has continued? 

I do not know how you would design that — and I can understand 
the incentive for getting in the door, having a job. It is very, very 
important. Statistics clearly show that if a person gets a job, then 
many times, he is on his way. It seems to me, though, it is also 
important to give that contract agency some incentive to get a job 
that possibly matches the training the person has and/or also a job 
that that person may be able to keep for a while or that that per- 
son will continue to work for a while. 

It seems to me that our whole emphasis is on any job, and it 
seems to me maybe it should be a modified version of tnat. 

Mr. Ross. I think you are right, and I think particularly now 
that we are beginning to introduce follow-up over time, that con- 
tracts ought to reflect that, that there ought to be incentives for the 
type of job and the duration. I think that makes great sense, and 
that is something I think we ought to be working on. 

Senator DeWine. Thank you. 

The Chairman. Senator Simon had a follow-up. 

Senator Simon. Yes. I would just like to enter into the record 
some letters in support of Job Corps from Wilma Mankiller, the 
chief of the Cherokee Nation, and some others, and then just one 
quick question. 

[Letters referred to may be found in the appendix.] 



152 

Senator Simon. Senator Kassebaum mentioned the idea of re- 
cruiting people only from the community. My impression is that 
one of the pluses is if you can sometimes take young people away 
from their communities, there is a real plus; they sever the ties 
from a gang or from family problems and other things. 

Would you like to comment on that? 

Mr, Ross. I would first of all say that whenever people can stay 
in a community and have those ties, and they are beneficial, that 
is wonderful; I agree with the chairman. In other cases, people are 
looking to get out of the environment, and in fact, success means 
going away. 

I guess the best analogy is almost a major State university. It 
draws mainly from the State but really relies on high schools all 
over the State to help brin^ people to it and usually, in order to 
put it all together ana keep itself interesting, has some out-of-State 
residents as well. 

In a sense, the Job Corps works something like that. And for a 
lot of young people — some of my own kids; I am a father of three — 
getting away from home was in fact a major step in development 
and growing up; it was a good thing to do. Sometimes kids say, &quot;I 
am not ready yet. I would like to stay closer to home.&quot; Hopemlly, 
we have enough flexibility in this system to allow both. 

Senator Simon. Thank you. 

Thank you. Madam Chairman. 

The Chairman. Thank you. 

Thank you, Mr. Rell, Assistant Secretary Ross. We appreciate 
your being here. 

Mr. Ross. Thank you. Madam Chairman. Thank you all. 

Mr. Rell. Thank you. 

The Chairman. It is a pleasure to welcome the third panel, and 
we appreciate very much your patience in waiting until after one 
o&apos;clock. 

I would like first to introduce Representative Ronald Coleman, 
from the 16th District of Texas. We appreciate very much your 
coming over. Congressman Coleman, to give a special introduction. 
It is a pleasure to welcome you here because you represent the dis- 
trict of El Paso and have been a lifelong resident there and know 
well, I think, the work of the center there, which has set a good 
record for Job Corps centers. So thank you for coming over. 

STATEMENT OF HON. RONALD COLEMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE 
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS 

Mr. Coleman. Thank you. Senator. 

I appreciate very much the opportunity to be here. 

Senator DeWine, it is good to see you again. Welcome back to 
Washington. 

Let me say to you that I am here, really, just to introduce Mary 
Young, the director of the David Carrasco Job Corps Center in El 
Paso. I am a strong supporter of the Job Corps centers. As I know 
Senator DeWine remembers, back in the mid-eighties, we went 
through a process that called for a good deal of slashing and cut- 
ting of programs. We know we are in a similar situation today, and 
I would just say to you that I can tell you that I am a supporter 
and continue to be because of the excellent results that we have 



153 

seen in El Paso as a result of having a quality, class act with a 
Job Corps center that is supported dv my business community, 
small and large, and that is supported by the citizens of my dis- 
trict. 

Under Ms. Young&apos;s leadership, this Job Corps center has made 
a difference in the lives of literally thousands of young people. To 
have them in our community and stay in our community is some- 
thing we endeavor to do. It is not our intention for them to leave; 
we want them to stay and work within our community. 

I would tell you that I think the Job Corps center in El Paso is 
a true model for excellence. I attend twice a year a regular meeting 
at which they ask me for a congressional rundown of what is going 
on in Washington, DC. I think it is an excellent part of their pro- 
gpram, and I am always happy to oblige. 

During its 24 years of operation, as you may know, the Job Corps 
center in El Paso has been honored with the highest commenda- 
tions. I will not go through all of them; I have submitted my state- 
ment for the record. I wiU only tell you that I happen to know that 
Mary Young was especially proud of the 1990 Secretary of Labor, 
Elizabeth Dole&apos;s, recognition of the center for having maintained a 
number one ranking for 12 consecutive years. 

Mary will present to you her viewpoint on how we think other 
Job Corps can learn from our experience. I represent the fifth-poor- 
est district in the United States, so it is not as though I come to 
you with the understanding that this is a model with no problems. 
We certainly do have young people with great difficulties, and 
many minorities attend our Job Corps center. 

I will just tell you that it is also my view that it would be impru- 
dent for anyone to try to paint a picture of the Job Corps system 
itself in a negative light, because all centers certainly do not fall 
into any one mold. 

Ms. Yoimg has been associated with the El Paso center since 
1970 and has been the center director since 1990. Really and truly, 
her continuing legacy to El Paso and our Nation is truly wonderful 
for us to see, because she has been extremely successful in creating 
a number of graduates from our center and their placement in jobs, 
which has made a true difference in my town. 

Thank you. Senator, for permitting me to introduce her. 

The Chairman. Thank you very much. Congressman Coleman. 
We appreciate your coming over. 

The Chairman. May I now introduce the rest of the panel. 
Jamison Grorby is a student at the Red Rock Job Corps Center in 
Lopez, PA. Curtis Gadsden is director of worldwide marketing for 
High-End Storage Devices with IBM Corporation. 

f would like to ask if it would be all right if Mr. Gadsden could 
go first with his testimony. He has a 2 o&apos;clock flight to catch, which 
is going to push it a little close. 

Does anybody else have a transportation problem? 

Ms. Young. No. 

Mr. GoRBY. No. 

The Chairman. Well, thank you. Mr. Gadsden, would you please 
proceed? I would just like to say that Senator Jeffords is going to 
be taking over for me in a few moments. I have to be away from 
the committee for a time. 



154 

Thank you very much, all of you, for being here. 
Mr. Gadsden? 

STATEMENTS OF CURTIS GADSDEN, DIRECTOR OF WORLD- 
WIDE MARKETING FOR HIGH-END STORAGE DEVICES, IBM 
CORP., MAHWAH, NJ; MARY S. YOUNG, DIRECTOR, CARRASCO 
JOB CORPS CENTER, EL PASO, TX; AND JAMISON GORBY, 
RED ROCK JOB CORPS CENTER, LOPEZ, PA 

Mr. Gadsden. Madam Chairman, thank you very much, Senator 
Kennedy and the other Senators, and also thanks to the panel for 
allowing me to go first. I will probably miss the flight, but I will 
give it my best snot. 

My name is Curtis Gadsden. I am 47 years old. My wife and 
stepson and myself reside in Mahwah, NJ. I am currently, as 
Madam Chairman said, director for IBM of Worldwide Storage 
Marketing. 

I graduated from Job Corps in December 1967. I was a very 
young lad, who had left rural America, in search of bettering my 
life. My brother and sisters £md I attended segregated school in 
South Carolina. I left after ^aduating from high school and started 
working in a laundry in Union City, NJ. Then I read about the Job 
Corps center. 

I enrolled in 1967. There was a screening process which, in my 
opinion, was a very good process. From tnere, they sent me to 
Clearfield, UT, where I studied accounting. 

I would like to point out one of the benefits of community in- 
volvement. I heard Madam Chairman ask someone on the first 
panel should there be community involvement. In my personal 
opinion, I think that it is very beneficial, because having left Jersey 
City, going to Clearfield, UT, some 3,000 miles away from home, 
not knowing anyone, not knowing that environment, and never 
having been on an airplane — that was in 1967, the first time ever — 
not knowing the western part of the country, what they did at that 
center was they invited in people from the community, who met 
with us and embraced us. We established trust and confidence, and 
we established rapport with the residents in Clearfield, UT. From 
time to time, they would invite us on weekends and for Thanks- 
giving dinner. 

So Dack to her question about should people in the community 
be involved in these programs, my answer would be yes, as well as 
the private sector. 

We also toured Theikold Chemical Corp. which, in my opinion, 
gave us some insight into things that one can excel to become later 
on in life — engineering, science, etc. So I thought that that was 
very, very helpful. 

However, at the Clearfield center, I really wanted to get involved 
in computers. They transferred me from the Clearfield center to the 
New Bedford center in Massachusetts, where I studied computers. 

And although it is not in my statement, I might add that during 
that time, I recall a visit to the New Bedford center by Senator 
Kennedy and staff&quot; in 1967. And I have heard a lot of testimony 
this morning that is very disturbing to me, but I can tell you that 
at that center, there was a lot of pride. When we heard the Senator 
was coming, we competed to see what dorm would be the best, be- 



155 

cause there were awards. We had on a weekly basis the &quot;dorm of 
the month,&quot; There were incentives at the centers to motivate and 
inspire young Americans. 

Also, there was a &quot;student of the month&quot; club, which I am 
pleased to tell you that in 1967, in the month of July, I was named 
student of the month. 

So there were many incentives to motivate young Americans dur- 
ing the 1967 time frame. I just wanted to share that with you. 

Needless to say, I furthered my education, but Job Corps gave 
me the foundation to build upon, and I am pleased to tell this com- 
mittee today that this foundation that I have established, through 
the help of the Federal Government, is as solid as the Twin Towers 
in New York City. Nothing can shake my foundation, because I am 
very comfortable with the time the Grovemment spent investing in 
me, so that today, I can return thousands and thousands of tax dol- 
lars to the Federal (government. And in addition to that, my church 
record will show that I also donate a fair amount of money to my 
church, to help feed the hungry in Newark, NJ, Every year, I do- 
nate one paycheck out of my monthly salary to the United Way. So 
I am a self-sufficient American, with a wife and one son, and 
thanks to God, the Job Corps put me on that platform, and I never 
have to look back; I always look ahead, to a better future in Amer- 
ica. 

Thank you very much. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gadsden may be found in the ap- 
pendix.] 

Senator Jeffords [presiding]. Thank you, Curtis, and I will devi- 
ate from the normal system of hearing n^om the entire panel before 
questions; I know how long it takes to race to the airport so I want 
to help you in that regard. 

I will ask you, have you had occasion to visit other Job Corps 
centers since your time there? Have you had the opportunity to do 
that? 

Mr. Gadsden. Yes, sir. I visited the one in Jersey City. I do not 
know if it is still there. This one was located on Montgomery Ave- 
nue in Jersey City. I visited that one in the mid-1970&apos;s. 

Senator Jeffords. And do you still follow up with some of your 
peers that you graduated with? 

Mr. Gadsden. A couple of them, yes. One gentlemam was my 
roommate, Ray Espayanas out of Carlsbad, NM. I have chatted 
with him a few times, and I have also chatted with Theodore 
Hoehne, out of Vineland, NJ. 

Senator Jeffords. Are they also paying their share in terms of 
taxes, the way you are? 

Mr. Gadsden. Yes, sir. 

Senator, if I may, can I just leave a couple of recommendations 
with you? 

Senator Jeffords. Of course. I want to give you that oppor- 
tunity. 

Mr. Gadsden. Thank you, sir. 

I believe that this committee should seriously take a look at com- 
munity and private involvement. I believe that that is the key. I 
have heard testimony about how kids are reacting today, and that 
is unfortunately the society in which you and I live today. 



156 

When I went to Clearfield, UT, white Americans embraced a 
black American fi&apos;om Jersey City, and that was asking a lot on 
their part, and I really appreciated that. So I believe you really 
need to take a look at corporate and community support. 

The second point is I think you should revisit the screening proc- 
ess. I heard about the kinds of students in the program. The pro- 
gram itself is great, but I really think you should teke a look and 
say these are the students we are looking for — students from poor 
families, students who would like to excel, students who are look- 
ing for a second chance in life. I really suggest you take a look at 
that. 

I am not an expert here; I can only tell you what we do in the 
private sector to motivate people. Maybe we need to try to get the 
contractors to place students so they will stay with the job; maybe 
you would want to take a look at an incentives program. Senator 
DeWine asked about an achievement bonus. Maybe you would 
want to take a look at the $400 and consider giving them $200 at 
placement and 9 or 12 months later down the road, give them an- 
other $500 or $600 or $700. That is a motivational type of incentive 
that will help the contractors as well as the employers to keep 
these people employed. 

Also, I think there were some things that worked extremely well 
when I was there. Why not take a look at incenting these students? 
Do a &quot;student of the month,&quot; do a &quot;dormitory of the month.&quot; We 
have to change the way we do things today. We cannot stay the 
course that we used yesterday, because we are in a different world 
today. 

Thank you. 

Senator Jeffords. Thank you for very excellent testimony. 

Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWine. I am going to vote for you getting to the air- 
port, Mr. Gadsden. 

Mr. Gadsden. I am fine. If I miss the flight, I can catch another 
one. This is important. 

Senator DeWeste. Well, I appreciate your testimony, and I think 
your recommendations are very interesting, and your testimony 
was very compelling. I appreciate it. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator Jeffords. Thank you very much, Curtis. 

Senator Jeffords. Mary, would vou proceed, please? 

Ms. Young. Distinguished members of the committee, my name 
is Mary S. Young. I am the director of the David L. Carrasco Job 
Corps Center in El Paso, TX. 

The center in El Paso has been operated since its inception by 
the Texas Educational Foundation, Incorporated, which is a non- 
profit foundation formed to improve the lives of young people 
through the operation of Job Corps centers. 

The Texas Educational Foundation also has continuously oper- 
ated the Gary Job Corps Center in San Marcos, TX since March 2, 
1965. This 2,200-student center was the second Job Corps center 
to be opened in the Nation. 

I am pleased to have the opportunity to share information with 
you about the Carrasco Center in El Paso which, as I tell new stu- 



157 

dents each week in orientation, is truly a place filled with oppor- 
tunity for them to change and improve their lives. 

Our center is named in honor of our founding director of 20 
years, Davis L. Carrasco, who established the philosophy which 
continues to serve as the basis for our program operation, and I 
also believe as the basis for the success of our center and its grad- 
uates. This philosophy is based on the firm belief that young people 
with very bleak fiitures can be empowered to drastically change the 
direction of their lives through a transformation which occurs as 
they progress through the Job Corps education and training pro- 
gram. 

Our center has been recognized as the flagship of Job Corps for 
many years. The Texas Educational Foundation&apos;s large center in 
San Marcos also has been recognized throughout its nearly 30 
years of operation as a center with consistently sound performance. 

We have an inherent advantage at the Carrasco Center in that 
all of our students are enrolled from the local community of El 
Paso. This enables us to involve parents and guardians strongly in 
the progress or lack of progress of their sons and daughters. 

However, I believe that the most significant strength in our pro- 
gram lies in the dedication and commitment of our staff. We enjoy 
tremendous longevity in our staff group, a dedicated group of peo- 
ple who have made the Job Corps their lives&apos; work. Their goal, in 
keeping with our basic philosophy, is one of quality and high per- 
formance. 

Our standards are high and are emulated to our students bv our 
staff, who are firmly conscious that they must be role models for 
those whose lives have been entrusted to us. 

The dedication of our staff projects a positive and motivating 
image to our students. We set high standards for ourselves and for 
our students and expect these to be met by all individuals in both 
groups. 

Our approach is preventive, educational, and if need be, correc- 
tive. 

Another key concept in our philosophy and daily operations is 
one of firm discipline. I have heard a lot of talk today about zero 
tolerance for violence, and actually this is somewhat of a new term 
to us. But our 25-year philosophy has always been an absolute in- 
tolerance for violence of^one person against another. 

At the same time, our commitment is to serve the individual 
needs of each student at all costs until these needs bring or have 
the potential to bring harm to another individual or to the student 
and staff group as a whole. 

Many of our students come to us with a history of gang affili- 
ation. One of our innovative approaches in combating this influence 
has been to develop an ongoing working relationship with the El 
Paso police department. Officers come to the center on a regular 
basis, counsel with students, have lunch with them in the cafeteria, 
and develop individual relationships which help our students to 
sever their past gang affiliations and move toward and new and 
more productive way of life. The police officer becomes a real per- 
son to know and respect, rather than someone to fear. 

Another innovative aspect of our program is an extension of sup- 
port to students once they have graduated and entered the work 



158 

world. Through the use of follow-up questionnaires to employers, 
we obtain information about the success of our graduates in their 
employment, or difficulties or problems that they are encountering. 
When the latter is reported, instructors and counselors continue to 
work with graduates in order to improve their job performance. 

Our students and generations of their families before them have 
been on welfare. However, they do not want to continue to remain 
in this circumstance. A classic example of this fact is a graduate 
of our center who works as a switchboard operator. When she re- 
ceived her first paycheck, she presented it to me proudly and said, 
&quot;Mrs. Young, because of this check, I no longer have to take wel- 
fare, and I am the first person in my family who has not had to 
live on welfare.&quot; She continues at her same job, 15 years later. She 
is not a Ph.D., although we have those, but she has supported her 
children as a single parent, and they have not lived on welfare. 

Although I have spoken about our uniqueness and a number of 
our program innovations, I do not want it to appear that our center 
is so different that it is not a part of the Job Corps program. We 
are only an example of the very effective national Job Corps pro- 
gram which has provided the guidance and direction, monitoring 
and supervision, that has enabled us to develop innovative en- 
hancements to the basic Job Corps program. 

I strongly believe that it is imperative that the Job Corps remain 
structured as a national program so that the program quality that 
the David L. Carrasco Center has developed can continue to flour- 
ish. 

I am here to testify today to the fact that our students complete 
the Job Corps program and go on to iobs, military service, and 
higher education, and off the welfare rolls. I firmly believe that the 
national Job Corps program is a viable one, a successful program 
that should not be dismantled or reconfigured, nor should its fund- 
ing be cut, for to do so would severely harm our most vulnerable, 
and potentially our most valuable resource — our youth, who I know 
can be developed into trained, skilled workers to advance our econ- 
omy rather than be a burden on it. 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide information 
to you today as you seek to evaluate the effectiveness of the Job 
Corps program. 

Senator Jeffords. Thank you very much. 

Senator Jeffords. Our next and last witness is Mr. Jamison 
Grorby, who is a student in Lopez, PA. I am sure this is the first 
time you have testified before a Senate committee. I remember my 
first time before a Senate committee. I was an attorney general at 
the time, and I was very nervous; I do not know about you. 

First of all, let me ask you, where is Lopez? 

Mr. GoRBY. It is about 30 miles northeast of Harrisburg. It is a 
nice place. It is out in the country, kind of. 

Senator Jeffords. Where is your home? 

Mr. GrORBY. My home is Cochranton, which is just south of Erie, 
PA. 

Senator Jeffords. How far is that from Lopez? 

Mr. GoRBY. Well, it is a 6-hour drive. 

Senator Jeffords. That is some distance; so you are not in your 
community. 



159 

Mr. CjORBY. No. 

Senator Jeffords. Well, go ahead with your statement, and take 
your time. Do not worry about the lights. 

Mr. GoRBY. I am a student at Red Rock Job Corps. I have been 
there for about 5 months. I will tell you a little bit about my back- 
ground, where I am from and a couple of places I have been. 

When I was 4, my parents got divorced. I grew up in Cochran ton, 
and the year that I turned 12, my stepfather and my mother and 
myself moved to California. Growing up in a small town out in the 
country and then moving to a large city was pretty unique; it was 
a lot to handle. I weinted to be back in Pennsylvania, and I decided, 
after numerous arguments with both my mother and my stepdad, 
that I was going to do my own thing. 

I went out on the streets, and for approximately 2 years, I lived 
on the streets in California, and I made my living out there on the 
streets by &quot;signing.&quot; What that is — I am sure you have seen people 
standing on street corners, holding signs that say &quot;Will work for 
food or wages.&quot; 

Among the places I stayed were old, condemned houses. At that 
time, I was too young to hold a iob, so there was not a lot for me 
to be able to do. I diaa lot of odd jobs like mowing lawns and stuff 
like that, to keep myself alive. 

From there, a gentleman picked me up 1 day, fed me, gave me 
a place to stay and offered me a job witn him at his towing com- 
pany. After about a year living with him, we got to be pretty good 
friends, and he contacted my mother, and she came to me with a 
plane ticket and told me I could either come back to live with her, 
or go back to Pennsylvania and stay with my dad. So I went back 
to Pennsylvania and moved in with my father. 

We had our problems. Growing up, I never really got to know my 
real dad, £ind so we had our problems adjusting to each other, and 
things did not work out there. Sp I spent a lot of time in and out 
of group homes and foster homes. 

My dad gave custody of me to my uncle, who lives in Erie, and 
I went up and stayed with him. In my time with him, I worked at 
different jobs, like the country fair and stuff like that. 

What I wanted from life at that time was to make something of 
myself because I had been through a lot; I had been down at the 
bottom. Some friends of mine knew about Job Corps and had 
signed up for Job Corps, and I learned about the program from 
them. I thought there was a golden opportunity to make up what 
I had lost over the last several years. 

So I went in and talked to my screener and signed up and went 
into Job Corps, and I am proud to say that that has been a big 
milestone in my life. It has been a great privilege to be able to be 
there and put forth effort to better myself so that I can help my 
community and other communities later in life. 

While I was there, I got mv GED, and I was named academic 
student of the month. Red Rock is more of a challenge. I get to deal 
with new people. You learn how to live with different types of peo- 
ple with different backgrounds, from different areas. 

One thing about Job Corps that I can really appreciate is that 
it is structured, but it is not so structured that you cannot be who 
you are and achieve your goals. 



160 

Having been in and out of group homes, they are very, very 
structured; you do not have your own freedom. 

Red Rock has given me an opportunity to succeed. I have total 
support from all the staff members there. They all make you feel 
really good. Having support from the staff members makes me 
want to push myself even more. I have been to enough places and 
been through enough that I know it is time to settle down; it is 
time to make something out of life. 

I still keep in contact with all my family and all my friends. 
When I presented my GED to my father, he got a little tear in his 
eye, and he said, &quot;See — we always knew you could do it. You just 
had to put forth the effort.&quot; 

I thank Grod and Job Corps that I did it, because without them, 
I would never have had the chance. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gorby may be found in the ap- 
pendix.] 

Senator Jeffords. Where are you now, Jamison, in your life&apos;s 
plan? You are still at the school. 

Mr. Gorby. Yes, I am still at the school. 

Senator Jeffords. But you have your GED. 

Mr. Gorby. I have my GED. 

Senator Jeffords. And what are you doing now? Are you in skill 
training? 

Mr. Gorby. Yes; I am taking brick masonry as my skills train- 
ing. I have got 11 more TARs to complete the shop and become a 
graduate. I plan to take the advanced course in brick and leave 
with my advanced degree. 

Senator Jeffords. Let me ask both of you some questions. I 
think one of the areas that Senator Kassebaum and I are inter- 
ested in is community. In your case, you are not near your commu- 
nity, and in some respects, because of your family life, it would ap- 
pear that perhaps it was better to be away from the community 
that you were then living in — or would you have rather been near 
to where one of your parents was? 

Mr. Gorby. Being where I am has helped because it has kept me 
far enough away from my old friends and so on so I do not have 
an urge to go back and do a lot of the things that I used to do, 
but I am close enough that I can still stay in contact with every- 
body back there. The community there, and the communities 
around Red Rock, are very, very supportive. 

I would have to say that I feel I owe the community a lot because 
without them, we would not have the opportunity to go up there 
and succeed and make something out of our lives. 

Senator Jeffords. Mary, I am sort of halfway in a dilemma. I 
know in our Job Corps, we were all community for a while in Ver- 
mont, or at least in northern New England. Now, the assignment 
method is first come, first served, so we are finding that our Ver- 
monters are going down to urban centers, and young people from 
urban environments are coming to Vermont, and that has created 
some problems with the mixture of culture and style. So I am sort 
of in the middle — I can understand Jamison&apos;s situation eind others, 
where it is best to get out of an environment, perhaps. 



161 

So at least it seems to me that the individual ought to have a 
choice rather than be assigned arbitrarily as they are now. I would 
appreciate your comments on that. 

Ms. Young. Well, the students do have a choice. When students 
approach recruiting offices, they do have a choice to request a cen- 
ter. Some students from El Paso do choose to go elsewhere. How- 
ever, it is also a residential program, so that even in our setting 
there are some students who will not choose to go on the weekends; 
they will remain at the center all the time. But the support of the 
family members, whatever that family structure is, the support of 
it, unless there is none whatsoever, is beneficial to the success of 
the program, I believe. 

Senator Jeffords. How do you measure educational success? We 
have a serious problem in this country, as you well know, to say 
nothing of Job Corps. Statistics show that about one-third of our 
young people who graduate from high school now are functionally 
illiterate and that half who ^aduate do not have what we would 
consider an acceptable education. 

Are you required to, or have you yourselves established what 
must be accomplished toward an education in order to be consid- 
ered to have successfully graduated? 

Ms. Young. Yes. The goal is to advance reading ability and math 
gains by 2 years, and our length of stay is approximately 1 year, 
so this is an auspicious goal to advance at least double tne enroll- 
ment time, and it is measured by a nationally normed test, the test 
of adult basic education. 

Senator Jeffords. Now, is it a requirement to have that test? 

Ms. Young. Yes. That is a national requirement to administer 
that test. 

Senator Jeffords. Senator DeWine? 

Senator DeWdje. I have no questions. I appreciate the testimony 
very much. 

Senator Jeffords. Thank you both very much, and Jamison, we 
wish you well and look forward to watching your career. I have a 
lot of brick work that needs to be done at my house. [Laughter.] 

I thank both witnesses, and I thank everyone out there m the 
audience for coming. This is an extremely interesting and critical 
and necessary subject of job training that we have been investigat- 
ing, and Senator Kassebaum has done an extraordinarily excellent 
job in bringing witnesses and being involved, and hopefully, we can 
derive some policy changes here to better utilize the training re- 
sources that we have. 

As I brought out before, we have an incredible need for training, 
and our resources are very, very limited. We only have enough 
money to take care of about 10 percent of the imiverse right now 
of those who need training, and each year we are graduating some 
800,000 young people who are in need of training when they grad- 
uate. If we were to adequately train all of them, it would cost us 
about $8 billion a year, and these people are out there, looking for 
further training. So this is a very, very serious problem that Sen- 
ator Kassebaum and I are looking at to see how we can better uti- 
lize those resources that we have and at the same time, how we 
can improve our basic education so that the need for remedial 
training, which is costing our businesses billions of dollars a year, 



162 



can be eradicated and made unnecessary so that we can be com- 
petitive in a very competitive world, and so that all of us can have 
a higher standard of living and live better lives. And all of that, 
we have got to do with less resources. But hopefully, we will be 
able to find the resources by reordering our priorities.

Prepared Statement of John Deering 

Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, members of the Committee. My name 
is John P. Deering. Tm from Wisconsin and I&apos;m employed as a Job Corps Admis- 
sions Counselor for Region Five, which covers eleven job corps centers in six states. 

As an admissions counselor for Job Corps, I strongly oelieve in the positive 
changes that take place in the voung people we serve: the Job Corps graduates that 
return home and find meaningml employment. 

But I also believe that Job Corps could be changed to increase graduation rates 
and improve service. In my opinion, there are three inherent problems with the way 
the program is currently managed. 

First, the Job Corps Centers (JCC) are contracted agents of the Department of 
Labor (DOL) and are paid per head for each individual on center and each student 
that graduates. I believe this policy forces the Job Corps center operator into keep- 
ing students who exhibit inappropriate behavior, i.e., those with criminal records, 
drug dealers and gang members. 

Several of the Job Corps campuses in the repon I represent do not even appear 
safe for the young in and women that I recruit. I toured a lai^e center in November 
and was told by several youth that they did not feel safe there. I was also told that 
gang activity was rampant on that center, which included riots and incidents of 
arson. 

I have a hard time sending young men and women to centers that are unsafe or 
have a history of gang activity or violence. I have had young people return home 
prematurely because they did not feel safe. The stories of violence from these young 
pwple are enough to scare any ADULT. 

To allow rural youth from Wisconsin to travel to large, dangerous centers is to 
invite failure for these young people and for Job Corps. It is very hard to overcome 
the persuasion of a disgruntlea youth returning home and telling friends and family 
that Job Corps is unsafe. 

Second, the screening agencies are also contracted agents. This poses the same 
problems as above. Admission counselors often recruit young people whose past be- 
havior is inappropriate for the program, in order to keep their numbers up so they 
do not lose their jobs. 

Third, the DOL regional office has too much control over when and if students 
arrive on center. All potential student files are screened throudi DOL which may 
take weeks or months to determine eligibility. There is very little continuity be- 
tween the screeners, DOL and the various job corps centers. 

I believe the above problems could be easily overcome with only a few changes: 

1. Make the Job Corps Center operator responsible for recruitment in their region/ 
state. This would make the screener accountable to the Job Corps center director 
and help to prevent the admission of ineligible students. It would then be the re- 
sponsibility of the individual Job Corps center to ensure that the students on center 
were appropriate. This would offer clear responsibility for who is to blame when stu- 
dents with inappropriate behavior are admitted to the center (as in Minnesota) and 
create problems. 

2. Allow the Job Corps Center to make the determination of eligibility of students 
instead of the Department of Labor. This would speed the process and open commu- 
nication between the center and the screener. Again, this makes the center operator 
directly responsible for the safety of students. 

3. Make the Department of Labor responsible for oversight of the functions de- 
scribed above and for providing technical advice to screeners and job corps centers. 

Thank you. 

Prepared Statement of Robert Belfon 

Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, Members of the Committee: 

I wish to thank you for inviting me to testify. My name is Robert Belfon, I am 
a Pediatric Dental Specialist with practices in Piscataway and Plainfield, New Jer- 
sey. 

I W81S a contracted medical services provider at The Edison Job Corps facility from 
the period of April 1991— June 1993, in Edison, New Jersey, which was adminis- 
tered for the Department of Labor by ITT. 

In early February 1991, I was contacted by the medical staff of Edison Job Corps 
which requested that I see a few of the resident Corps members in my office for 
the purpose of providing dental treatment. The arrangement suited us and I agreed. 



164 

Subsequently, Mrs. Jacqueline Tchir, the then Health Services Manager inquired 
if I might be interested in joining them as a contracted dental services provider. She 
went on to explain the philosophy of Job Corps, and how it serves underorivUeged 
and possibly misdirected youths, many of them from the inner city, and many of 
them from minority groups. She also explained the many training programs that 
were set up for young people, and how for many of them, it was the first time out 
of the ghetto ana a drug ridden environment. 

Well, I must admit that I found the proposition challenging. As a 46 year old 
black male, who was raised in a South West Bronx Housing Project, and a former 

fang member, I know that I could have never survived my teenage years in the tur- 
ulent drug-crazed sixties without the many guardian angels that helped shape me 
to be what I am today. Indeed many, if not most of the young men who were my 
contemporaries in that housing proiect, never made it to their twenty-fifth birthday, 
let alone out of the ghetto. So, neeoless to say, I jumped at the chance to give some- 
thing back, and mavbe make a difference in some kid&apos;s life. I guess I even saw my- 
self as a role model, as I assumed the other staff members and administrators un- 
doubtedly were. 

Well, 1 certainly was wrong in my assumptions. I soon found that what we had 
in Edison was the Edison Job Corps Center Ghetto Dumping Ground. By this state- 
ment, I mean that these young people were taken from a negative environment of 
many inner cities, the tri-state area, only to be placed in another negative environ- 
ment in Edison, New Jersey, to be victims of another system that had no concern 
for the human being but just the slot that he or she occupied. If all the slots were 
filled, then all was right with the world and Job Corps. It was nothing more than 
a numbers game. 

The Center Director&apos;s mandate wtis to preserve the census, so that the govern- 
ment checks kept coming in. To keep the census up, HTV tests were misdated, posi- 
tive drug screening tests were ignored, medical problems not noted in charts, etc. 
Many thmgs were done to keep tne residents in, to facilitate and keep the numbers 
up. There were in fact several times that as per the Job Corps handbook I was obli- 
gated to terminate certain residents for medical reasons, and/or noncompliance of 
medical treatment. However, when I discussed this with the Medical Director and 
noted it in the charts I was advised by the Center Director that her interpretations 
of my instructions were different, and she refused to allow terminations to go 
through. Afterward I discussed this matter with the Regional Director who advised 
me that the Center Director should not have overridden my medical recommenda- 
tions. 

Some of the other measures that were taken to keep the residents happy and com- 
pliant were to allow them to conduct their social activities (including sexual) any 
place they saw fit, under our windows, in the bushes, behind buUdings, etc. In the 
spring and summer the Medical Department had an unusual high Incidence of poi- 
son ivy cases. To allow them not to go to class, and hang out in staircases, hallways, 
and even in the infirmary. Those residents that were assigned to the Medical De- 
partment to help out were allowed to sleep side-by-side in the beds next to the resi- 
dents that were housed in the infirmary for various illnesses; this was standard pro- 
cedure throughout the entire time that I was there. The Job Corps members were 
the only losers. They were not being prepared for a job or lives outside the Center, 
nor were they being tau^t basic skUls need to find, keep, and function in a job. 

As a matter of fact, a common complaint among the residents was that many of 
the job training programs that they were advised they could participate in before 
they joined were either no longer offered or had never been offered. 

Drug use and trafficking of the same were also &quot;overlooked.&quot; It was common 
knowledge around the Center that certain residents sold drugs in and out of Job 
Corps. In one particular case, there was a resident who drove a thirty thousand dol- 
lar customizea BMW, and would periodically be AWOL for weeks at a time, only 
to return and reenter the program to continue his business deals, yet nothing was 
ever done by the Center Director about it. 

Violent behavior was allowed. The Dental Department reported incidents of nega- 
tive and violent attitudes and behaviors, such as threats of a physical nature, etc. 
These incident reports were never even acknowledged. It was common knowledge 
among members of the staff that incident reports were not worth the ink they were 
written with. Alot of these violent residents went on to injure other staff members 
and/or residents. 

This type of behavior was disruptive and detrimental to those reaidents who 
wanted to make proper use of the programs and opportunities. Instead of establish- 
ing deterrents for this negative benavior by enforcing the rules, they were allowed 
to continually disrupt others and exhibit antisocial behavior, without any fear of 
consequences. 



165 

These young people were falling victims to the same negativity that presumably 
they had come to Job Corps to avoid or overeome. 

I must tell you that as a taxpayer, I condemn this misuse and abuse of moneys, 
and as a black man, I resented the For Profit Ghetto created by DOL and ITT, that 
only benefited the people who were running the programs. 

Tliroughout mv stewardship of the Dental Department, I wrote and forwarded 
manv letters and other correspondence to both DOL and ITT in reference to these 
incidents and irregularities, but they were all ignored. 

I hope my input serves to clarify some of the issues and concerns in these matters. 
I stand ready to assist you and your Committee with any help that you may need. 

Once again, I thank you for this opportunity to appear before you and to allow 
me to voice my concerns about this very serious issue. 

Prepared Statement John C. McKay 

Chairman Kassebaum, Senator Kennedy, members of the committee, my name is 
John C. McKay. I am honored to be here today. I feel I may be able to assist in 
helping Job Corps, a program I believe is worth saving. 

I entered the Job Corps program in 1965, shortly after its inception, as a deputy 
director and then a director of a civilian conservation center with the Bureau of In- 
dian Affairs. I later served as a national training director with the Office of Eco- 
nomic Affairs and as a project manager with the old Office of Economic Opportunity. 
In 1971, I was assigned to the Dallas regional office of Job Corps as a project man- 
ager where I served until my retirement last year. 

In the interest of time, I will briefly state my opinion of problems in the Job 
Corps. They are essentially the result oi a policy that seems intended to reward cen- 
ter contractors, but places the welfare and achievement of students far down the 
ladder of objectives. There is mismanagement in the program from Washington 
down to the regional offices. Speaking as someone who has seen the program trom 
the inside, I can honestly say that it is not worth the billion dollars that is being 
spent on it. 

Some examples: 

VIOLENCE ON CENTERS 

1. In August 1992, I reviewed a complaint from U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers re- 
garding the Little Rock Job Corps Center. The complaint identified drug problems, 
physical abuse of students, disciplinary problems, and students with weapons on 
center. The complaints were substantiated with incident and monitoring reports. 

2. As a member of the 1992 regional office review team of Guthrie (Oklahoma) 
Center, it was reported to me that students had beaten two security staff members 
so badly that they were hospitalized. The security director stated to me that he had 
resigned his position because the center administration would take no action against 
the students. 

The review team leader and the regional director refused to include my reouest 
to make this a part of the review report. It is, however, a matter of record of the 
hospitalization. 

3. A vocational staff member at the Quachita Civilian Conservation Center was 
beaten by a student and was hospitalized. As a result, he was off work for a period 
of three months. Here again, the center took no action to discipline the student. The 
regional director refiised to include this act in the regional office annual review of 
the center. 

4. The district attorney of Chavez County, New Mexico, considered criminal 
charges against the Roswell Center administration who failed to report a complaint 
of rape of a seventeen-year-old student by a twenty-year-old student. The center had 
allowed the twenty-year-old to terminate and leave the state. 

5. Serious incident reports in the Dallas regional office clearly show that during 
1992-1993, drug and gang-related incidents have increased discipline problems on 
the centers. Concerned staff have stated to me that these problems were out of hand 
and that if it were known that they had said this, they would lose their jobs. 

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM (PMS) 

Job Corps&apos;s Performance Measurement System was established to measure the ef- 
fectiveness of centers and the regional offices. While the intent was good, it simply 
is not an effective system to accurately me«isure effectiveness. 

1. On the many center reviews in which I have participated, I have never found 
a center to accurately report all categories of Performance Measurement System. 



166 

2. Vocational instructors do not have a total understanding of the requirements 
to certify students as a vocational completer. During reviews of centers and also 
during monitoring trips, I would review the individual student&apos;s training and 
achievement record. Instructors were not sure of the requirements for vocational 
completer certification. 

3. Reading and math gains could not be supported with test results, as the test 
results were not maintained in accordance with Job Corps requirements. 

4. Contractors have stated that not meeting Performance Measurement System 
would cause them to lose their contracts, and center staff felt they would lose their 
jobs if they did not go along with inaccurate reporting. 

5. Recently, in a center directors&apos; meeting, the regional director stated to the cen- 
ter directors that all centers could be &quot;me^um&quot; or &quot;high.&quot; He then said, &quot;You know 
what I mean.&quot; They knew. 

JOB CORPS POUCY 

Job Corps developed a policy and procedures handbook which caused many prob- 
lems for tne basic Job Corps mission. The most serious problems I experienced in 
reviewing and monitoring centers were: 

1. A serious policy change in the input of students. The statute which governs the 
eligibility of students for Job Corps precluded input of students with serious crimi- 
nal or drug problems. In an effort to keep the centers full, the Job Corps administra- 
tion changed this policy, and in effect, changed the Job Corps mission from basic 
education and vocational training to one of remediation, which is in direct conflict 
with the original Job Corps mission. 

2. New programs, such as the Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (AODA) program, 
created conflicts with established discipline policies. 

3. Center and Job Corps administration frequently ignores policy. 

PROGRAM MISMANAGEMENT 

I have witnessed the following problems of mismanagement, ethics and possible 
illegal activities in my tenure with Job Corps over the past decade and more. I 
would be pleased to provide the committee with further information regarding many 
of these problems. 

1. High level Job Corps ofllcials have had improper relations/interactions with 
contractors, including providing confidential information regarding bids on Job 
Corps centers to incumbent or favored contractors. This is identified in the Federal 
Acquisitions Regulations as an illegal act. 

2. There has been collusion by contractors when bidding on center contracts. It 
involves the practice of not bidding against each other. 

3. Awarding Job Corps support contracts in excess of $2,500 without competitive 
bids. This is also a violation of F-A.R. (Federal Acquisition Regulations). 

4. Contracts awarded to retiring, high level Job Corps officials upon their retire- 
ment by Job Corps national office to secure their silence and loyalty regarding their 
knowledge of illegal or improper activities by the National Office. 

5. The use of contractors to pay federal vouchers in an attempt to circumvent fed- 
eral procurement regulations. 

6. Musical chairs used in awarding Job Corps center contreicts, especially when 
both contractors have had serious operational problems resulting in the loss of other 
center contracts. 

7. High cost settlements made to protect corporate and possible high level federal 
staff, paid for with appropriated fiinds, and then sealed to protect the facts of the 
complaints. 

8. The lack of any oversight by congressional committees during the past ten 
years. 

9. Job Corps policy is selectively enforced. 

I would like to offer the committee some recommendations for improving this pro- 
gram, but in the interest of time, I will end my testimor here and ask that tney 
be submitted for the record. I would be happy to respond to any questions the sen- 
ators might have about any of the information I have mentioned. 

Thank you. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

1. Prior to funding the Job Corps program for year 1996, audit the general and 
administrative expenses of at least five contractors. 

2. Abolish the existing thirty-year-old procedure of awarding contracts. 



167 

3. Consider federally-funded Job Corps Centers by states which would provide for 
local oversight, similar to local school boards. Provide training for local input and 
the opportunity for students to make weekend home visits. 

4. Ke-establish a mandatory discipline program to protect youth who want and 
need this program. 

Prepared Statement of Curtis Gadsden 

My name is Curtis Gadsden. I am a 47-year-old married man with one step son. 
I live in Mahwah, New Jersey. I just completed my 27th year with IBM. I am cur- 
rently Director of Worldwide Marketing for High End Storage Devices. In 1967, I 
was a 17-year-old black youth and I was trapped in a world of little opportunity. 
In 1968, I graduated from Job Corps. Job corps gave me not only job training and 
a basic education, but the motivation and courage to make more of my Ufe. 

I was just 18 years old in 1968 when I reaa about Job Corps in the newspaper 
and decided to enroll. I grew up in Stestephen, S.C., then a rural area with virtually 
no job prospects for young high school graduates. My father, a farmer and elec- 
trician, did the best he could to support our family. My seven brothers and sisters 
and I attended segregated schools. 

We studied by tne light of kerosene lamps until the family could afford electricity 
in the mid 19608. My mother measured every meal prior to cooking it. There were 
never seconds. We didn&apos;t get indoor plumbing until my senior year in high school. 

So you see I simply coiild not ask my parents for money to go to college or job 
training. My own lack of skills and racial discrimination completely obstructed my 
future. 

After graduating from high school, I traveled to Jersey City, N J. in search of op- 

f)ortunity. I lived with my older sister and worked at a minimum wage job in a 
aundry. That&apos;s when I decided to enroll in Job Corps. 

Within a few months, I traveled to the Clearfield Job Corps Center in Utah. I saw 
immediately that Job Corps was a place that would help me understand the dif- 
ferent nationalities of Americans. We all lived together on the center. I had a room- 
mate from New Mexico, and I learned so much about his cultural background. In 
a way. Job Corps brought the whole country together. 

At the Clearfield center, I trained in bookkeeping and accounting and I developed 
an interest in computers that would last a lifetime. I accepted the rules and the dis- 
cipline of center life because I was grateful to enhance my lifestyle. We were all se- 
verely poor and we lacked education. 

Then I switched to the Rodman center in Massachusetts to train in basic machine 
operations and wiring. At the time, the center was operated by IBM and offered the 
most up-to-date technological training. 

I will always remember that Job Corps tauj^t me a foundation of skills I could 
use in the maricetplace. Job Corps staff helped increase my self-confidence by telling 
me I could succeea. 

Not long after graduating from Job Corps, I started working for IBM pushing a 
mail cart in the stock room. But I new I wouldn&apos;t be there for long. Because Job 
Corps had given me a vision that Fd be doing more. Sure enough, IBM management 
saw my potential and promoted me to a computer operator trainee. Then I became 
a senior computer operator, a systems engineer, and finally a marketing manager. 
I earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science from Rutgers University — all this 
because I have never lost the desire to succeed that Job Corps gave me. 

We need Job Corps to breathe new life into our young people. At this point, we 
have a choice — we can either make America a prison or a globally competitive na- 
tion. If we invest in Job Corps, we&apos;re making the right choice. 

When I think about Job Corps, I see it as a federal investment in myself — one 
that Fve been returning for nearly a lifetime. I am living proof that Job Corps 
works. I&apos;m doing very well. I&apos;m self-sufficient. I certainly pay a lot of taxes, and I&apos;m 
a very hard-working American. I give thousands of dollars each year to various 
charities and to my church. I can afford it today because this country invested in 
me through Job Corps. I give it back every day. 

I hope that more young people who were like me find their way through Job 
Corps. I don&apos;t know where else will they go. There are more Americans out there 
who benefited from Job Corps than you can imagine. They might not talk about it, 
but they are working, supporting their families and living their lives free from pov- 
erty. 

Let me close by saying to this committee: Thanks to God for giving us Job Corps 
because it helped me and it&apos;s still helping kids who need it. Investing in Job Corps 
will reap the benefits tomorrow.

Ogden, Utah 84409, 

January 19. 1995. 

Hon. Nancy L. Kassebaum, 
U.S. Senate. 
Washington. DC 20510. 

Dear Senator Kassebaum: I am submitting this letter for the record of the Labor 
Committee&apos;s oversite hearing on Job Corps. Management&amp;Training Corp. is the 
laiTgest operator of Job Corps centers and also the operator of the Flint Hills Job 
Corps Center. MTC appreciates your effort to make these hearings a success, and 
welcomes the positive dianges which they are already bringing about. 

Since this round of hearings began some months ago, we have seen a clarification 
of expectations for center operators; a rethinking of which students are most appro- 
priate for Job Corps; and improved partnerships between the Department of Labor, 
center operators, and recruitment and placement contractors. We view the changes 
outlined in the Assistant Secretary&apos;s testimony as being beneficial to the program. 

On the whole, the hearings presented an accurate picture of Job Corps, its suc- 
cesses and its weaknesses. We felt some of the testimony was not accurate and did 
not present a fair picture. The circumstances under which some of the witnesses 
(students and stafi) left the program were not explained and may have provided the 
committee with some insist regarding motive. However, I believe most of what all 
the witnesses said contained some truth. 

We are very interested in seeing improvements being made to the Job Corps pro- 
gram and can ofTer some suggestions ourselves. It was unfortunate that the commit- 
tee was left with the conclusion that the simple answer to improving center per- 
formance was to get tough with the center operators. Turning over center operators 
is necessary in some cases. However, it is not a panacea and there are plenty of 
examples in which changing contractors did not improve the performance of a low- 
performing center. 

The success of a Job Corps center depends on open and honest partnerships be- 
tween all the players working for the benefit of the students: Congress, the center 
operator, the national office of Job Corps, the regional office of Job Corps, the orga- 
nization with the recruitment contract, the organization with the placement con- 
tract, the contractors or unions with the contract to operate the vocations on center, 
and the organization with the architectural services contract. Businesses have found 
great success implementing concepts of Total Quality Management which stress 
teamwork and partnerships. Strict accountability, high standards, and consequences 
for poor performance are also part of TQM, but strict accountability alone wUl not 
provide the foundation that can dramatically improve the process and the outcomes. 

We welcome your eflbrts to open this dialogue to mutually explore methods for 
substantial improvements in performance as well as greater efficiencies, and we 
want to be part of the debate. 

Finally, I propose that you consider appointing a blue ribbon commission, outside 
the Department of Labor, to look into ways to strengthen the program. A former 
Secretary of Labor could chair the commission and a representative group of experts 
from within the Job Corps system and from without could explore new approaches. 
I know that if you open the door, you will find that there are all sorts of meaningful 
suggestions that people are eager to make. 

I believe Bob Stokes&apos; approach to covert investigations, in which disgruntled 
former employees and students are heavily relied on, will not lead to solutions as 
good as those that would result from an open dialogue in which all are represented. 

You are already having a favorable impact on the program. You have the oppor- 
tunity to make a historic improvement in Job Corps. We want to help. 
Sincerely, 

Scott Marquardt, 

President.

Dear Senator Kassebaum: Northern Utah is fortunate to be the home of 
Clearfield Job Corps. Over the past two decades, I have had the opportunity to wit- 
ness the positive impact of this job training progn-am. Students come away irom the 
program with not only vocational skiUs but with the social skills necessary to be- 
come productive members of society. 

Whfle serving as a member of the community relations council for Clearfield Job 
Corps, I have been impressed with the quality of their training programs, social 
skills workshops and leadership opportunities. They train and provide job placement 
for a high percentage of the youth who enter the program. 

As federal job training programs are scrutinized, I would like to ask your support 
of Job Corps. I have witnessed firsthand the contribution Job Corps makes to North- 
em Utfih.

Hon. Robert F. Bennett,

Washington, DC 20510. 

Dear Senator Robert F. Bennett: Weber and Davis Counties have become in- 
creasingly grateful for the Clearfield Job Corps Center and all it does for our young 
people. 

Seventy-seven percent of the students who left Clearfield Job Corps Center last 
year became employed within six months aft«r leaving the program. They now can 
care for their families, pay taxes and contribute to our community both profes- 
sionally and socially. I attend community relations council meetings at the 
Clearfield Job Corps Center, and I am continually impressed with the quality of Job 
Corps&apos; curricula, training programs, social skills workshops, and leadership opportu- 
nities for students. There is no doubt that Job Corps is helping youth obtam employ- 
ment and become viable members of our community. 

As you and your colleagues scrutinize federal job training programs, I know you 
will find that Job Corps, with fiscal integrity, trains and places a high percentage 
of youth. In fact, why not enhance and expand Job Corps through the Job Corps 
50-50 Plan, a plan to enrich existing centers and gradually build 50 new centers 
by the end of the decade? Since 95 percent of the plan supports existing centers, 
we can be assured of continued quality services for youth. With the remainmg 5 per- 
cent, we can build new centers to help thousands more people become productive 
citizens. 

Senator Bennett, Job Corps deserves your support. Weber and Davis Counties 
have seen time and time agam how it gives back to all of us. 
Sincerely, 

Doyle E. Talbot, 

Chief of Police. 



Prepared Statement of Suzanne Smtth 

I was in attendance at the hearings on January 18 and 19 when testimony was 
given by individuals concerning their exp&gt;eriences with the Job Corps program. In 
some cases, their recommendations for corrective action were sought. 

Accompanying me at the hearings was the Executive Director of the Appalachian 
Council, Anthony Stellar, who has been involved with Job Corps since 1967. I have 
worked with Job Corps contracts for Appalachian Council since 1978. 



170 

Appalachian Council has operated Job Corps contracts for recruitment and place- 
ment since 1967. The operations have included states in seven of the ten regions 
of the Department of Labor. The Council also operates a national contract for ad- 
vanced placement for Job Corps students, the Industry Work Experience Program 
(IWEP), and the vocational tredning components of the Job Corps centers at Pitts- 
burgh and at Batesville, Mississippi. 

Qur collective experience has allowed a comprehensive perspective of the various 
components and functions of the Job Corps program. We have seen its successes, 
experienced first hand its growth, dealt with the youth who confirm its essential ra- 
tionale, and finally, we have watched with dismay as the quality of the program has 
been diminished by the statistical game-playing and cutthroat contracting methods 
which have taken place over the last eight or ten years. 

Many of the things brought out in the hearings we know to be true, and we have 
railed against to no avail. 

AFL-CIO Appaladiian Council began recruiting for Job Corps in 1967 at the re- 

2uest of GEO to recruit and screen rural youth in Appalachia for training in Job 
!orps. The premise behind the policy of the residential requirement for most of Job 
Corps is a valid one for the most part. Many youth need to leave an impoverished 
or aangerous environment to break out of a destructive mode of behavior. Recruit- 
ment agencies serve a valuable purpose in reaching populations not in proximity to 
a Job Corps center in screening youth, not for just a particular center, but in focus- 
ing on the needs of the individual youth for the type of training desired and the 
location preference relative to particular circumstances. 

Unlike some of the participants giving testimony, we believe there is definite ben- 
efit in keeping the functions of recruitment agencies and centers separate, thou^ 
they are, and should be, distinct compwnents oi a team which should have a common 
goal — to train at-risk youth so that they may become fiill participants in a produc- 
tive, fulfilling life which contributes to society in a meaningful way. Unfortunately, 
the Performance Measurement Standards in place for Job Corps contractors work 
against this team concept, and place centers and recruitment agencies at odds for 
survival. 

Outreach, Screening, and Placement contracts are fixed unit price, indefinite qual- 
ity contracts. They are competitively bid and are awarded for one year plus two op- 
tion years. The contractor gets paid per arrival for recruitment and per placement 
for placement contracts. Some regions contract for recruitment and placement in one 
operation. Others have separate contractors conducting recruitment and placement 
operations in the contract area. 

Center contracts are cost plus fixed fee tjrpe. They are let for two years plus three 
option years. They are also competitively bid, except, of course, for the conservation 
centers which are operated by the government. 

Centers face the problems of meeting the statistical standards set by the National 
Office, regarding On Board Strength (OBS), Weekly Termination Rate (WTR), and 
other stats indicating educational accomplishments of students, etc. Youth who ar- 
rive on center and stay one day or ten days (as did Rhonda Wheeler who testified) 
are a liability to the statistical performance of the center. It is customary for the 
center then to blame the recruiting agency for screening &quot;bad&quot; kids. 

Screening agencies must abide by the regulations set down in the Policy Require- 
ments Handbook for determining eligibility. Youth who have health or behavior-re- 
lated problems (mental/emotional or court jurisdiction) must have applications re- 
viewed by the Department of Labor Regional Office. All relevant information from 
professionals dealing with the youth&apos;s case are gathered by the screening agent and 
submitted with the application to the Department of Labor. &quot;Clean&quot; applicants are 
those who meet eligibility criteria and are without other mitigating circumstances 
in the background. Much in the recruitment process is dependent upon qualified 
staff who are capable of exercising good judgment. Even when those characteristics 
are present some youth will get into the program who perhaps should not be there. 
Yet, the essence of the program is to deal with youth at-risk, those who come out 
of environments where tnev have already experienced failure and where the systems 
have failed them. None of these young people who apply for Job Corps appear sis 
candidates for Princeton. Though many are talented and intelligent, their cir- 
cumstances have certainly not fostered or rewarded efforts for pursuing excellence. 

Thus, even when all ehgibility criteria are met, many youth who go into the pro- 
-am need much in the area of guidanoe,counseling, supervision, psychological help, 
in addition to training and education. Are the Job Corps centers equipped to supply 
what this disadvantaged group needs? Are the salaries being ofTered staff suflicient 
to attract the highly qualified people necessary to work with this target group? Are 
the Performance Measurement Standards forcing contractors to address numbers 
over the needs of the &quot;customer&quot; — the disadvantaged youth? 



171 

Screening agencies are being pressured to screen for &quot;suitability&quot; in addition to 
eligibility. Is the youth dressea as though he were part of a gang? Is he/she commit- 
ted to remaining in program? Screening contracts now are penalizing the fixed price 
contractor by deducting a percentage oi the unit price from the payment for a youth 
who does not remain on center for at least 30 days. 

Obviously youth who admit to or even flaunt gang membership are not &quot;suitable.&quot; 
But those who wish to hide it, can. Should the screener then deem the young person 
ineligible based on the manner of dressing or any other appearance? Some youth 
who seem enthusiastic and committed drop out after a weeK. Others who appear 
to be lukewarm about the program stay for a year and learn welding or carpentry. 

The Job Corps mission should be restated. Thai mission should determine policy, 
and policy should be the basis for procedures. 

Numbers-driven performance measurement misses the boat when assessing cjual- 
ity. While Regional Directors are screaming for quality and suitability in recruited 
youth, they are awarding contracts to recruitment agencies who win contracts with 
a low bid, and then pay screeners &quot;incentive&quot; commission based on numbers of ar- 
rivals. Again, numbers get in the way of quality. 

Procurement methods for contracting for Job Corps are a travesty, and in no way 
do they reflect the philosophy stated by Secretary Reich in his efforts to &quot;reinvent&quot; 
the Department of Labor. Fixed price contractors must bid on Job Corps services 
for which numbers to be recruited are inflated to assure the Region of the youth 
needed to fill the centers. Yet, the guarantee is for only 80% of the number in the 
solicitation, and the maximum provision is up to 200% of the number requested. To 
bid realistically and competitively while staying solvent is virtually impossible. 

Appalachian Council pays competitive salaries and fiill benefits ana so has mini- 
mal turnover in employees. Staff tenure averages over 12 years, some have 20 years 
experience in dealing with Job Corps youth. The Council, while performingat near 
100% of goal, has lost four contracts this year which we held for 28 years. The win- 
ner underbid considerably, pays on commission basis, and offers minimal benefits 
to employees. Their current performance in two of the contract areas is much below 
quota. 

Such contracting practice is a small example of evaluation procedures which, 
under the guise oi cost saving have instead cost the government lOO&apos;s of thousand 
of dollars, and have cost the real customer, the youth, the benefit of a quality man- 
aged program where outcomes are valued over output. 

The mission of Job Corps is noble and essential. It is a dual one, in our view. 
There should be specialized centers to deal with the court referred youth, and to 
address the different needs of the under 18-year-old. 

Training matched placement is not as relevant a measure of success as is the fact 
that the youth is now employable when he/she might have been in jail or worse. 
Many young people are saved because of Job Corps. I have personally spoken with 
a number oi young people whose lives were changed dramatically. 

Job Corps is expensive but less so than the cost of not addressing the issues that 
are its intrinsic mission. The Demming-style of quality management which is the 
basis for some of the reinvention policies of government tells us to go for quabty 
not quotas, and the bottom line will show a plus. If Job Corps dollars are spent 
wisely, the program could save the government money and save the society the bur- 
den of dealing with the residual of damaged lives.

Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC 20510. 

Dear Senator Kassebaum: The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes re- 
spectfully submit this letter for the Congressional Record as an expression of our 
support for Job Corps Programs. Since 1968, the Tribes have successfully operated 
the Kicking Horse Job Corps Center on the Flathead Indian Reservation. In 1972, 
we converted the Kicking Horse campus into an All-Indian Campus actively recruit- 
ing Indian students from throughout the United States. It is our position with 27 
years of experience, that Job Corps is a proven viable alternative for addressing the 
needs of disadvantaged youth. 

Nationally, Indian Reservations have the highest rates of poverty, unemployment, 
infant mortality, substance abuse, suicide and dropout rates to name a few of the 



172 

problems. As a result, Indian vouth endure intensified social degradation while at- 
tempting to assimilate into a dominant culture without any means of support. With 
limited resources, Tribal governments cannot fully address the socioeconomic needs 
of their reservations however, Job Corps Programs aid Indian communities in ad- 
dressing these problems. Since its inception, the Kicking Horse Job Corps Center 
has provided a safe environment for our students to excel academically and to ac- 
quire a competitive edge to compete in todays job market. We specifically provide 
quality services to the student population which contributes to raising the standard 
of living on most Indian Reservations by producing a better educated and trained 
workforce. 

The Department of Labor reports that Kicking Horse excels in placements, aca- 
demic standards with an above average GED attainment rate and the completion 
rate of the Vocational Program is consistently high. Most of our students could not 
have realized these successes without the residential campus and the support serv- 
ices we offer. Additionally, the Center has recently eamea the distinction of receiv- 
ing an Exemplary Status Certificate from the Montana State and Advisory Commit- 
tee for the Northwest Association of Schools Colleges and the Northwest Accredita- 
tion Team. This certificate demonstrates that we have gone &quot;above and beyond the 
standards of accreditation&quot; by instituting new and exemplary programs. 

Senator Kassebaum, we appreciate your efforts in conducting oversight hearings 
on the Job Corps Program. Please keep in mind that the Kicking Job Corps Program 
is truly a unique experience that provides employment opportunities and life skills 
for at risk youth. We urge you to review all oi the evidence such as the IG audits, 
GAO reports and performance statistics to determine the true cost-effectiveness of 
educating disadvantaged youth in America. 

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes firmly believe that the advancement 
of American society dejjends on Job Corps programs which provide essential services 
to disadvantaged youth. Job Corps brings hope, opportunity and empowerment to 
the millions of young people who are looking for a cnance to prove themselves. Ev- 
eryone benefits when at-risk youth are removed from unemployment and welfare 
rolls, kept off the streets and diverted from the lives of crime and violence. It be- 
hooves us all to support the 50/50 Plan for the continued expansion of Job Corps 
programs. Senator Kassebaum, Kicking Horse Job Corps students are living proof 
that Job Corps works. 

We appreciate the opportunity to share our enthusiasm for the continued success 
of Job Corps and look lorward to working with you on expanding programs for at- 
risk youth. 

Sincerely, 

Michael T. (Mickey) Pablo. 
Chairman of the Tribal Council.

Hon. Max Baucus, 

U.S. Senate, 

Washington, DC 20510. 

Dear Senator Baucus: Please include this letter as testimony in the Job Corps 
hearing next week. As a Business Instructor at Kicking Horse Job Corps in Ronan, 
Montana, I believe that the educational, vocational, &apos;and residential living programs 
can benefit young disadvantaged youth all over the United States. I have observed 
students that have taken advantage of this opportunity to develop self-esteem and 
improve their educational backgrounds during the six years I have been teaching. 

The video tapes of the CBS report appeared to be media sensationalism to me. 
The rebuttal by Director Boswell explams the behavior problems of the particular 
students taped. More importantly, if employees were doing the secret video taping; 
these employees set poor examples of what they were hired to do. In the Job Corps 
program, it is mandated that in appropriate behavior be addressed by all employees 
in order to provide a safe, secure environment for the students at any Job Corps 
Center. Concern should have been given to the behavior of the employees not con- 
fronting any inappropriate behavior they saw while observing students. 



173 

As far as the examples used in the tape, these negative scenes could be construed 
on any private or public school ground. We do not shut down schools when inappro- 

{)riate behavior is observed, the students are addressed regarding the behavior prob- 
em. It may be true that some students manage to enroll in Job Corps under false 
information provided during the application process. Certainly, it is difficult to docu- 
ment all activities of students particularly wnen they come from other states. Direc- 
tor Boswell has done a good job of reporting that some of these students were not 
contributing to a positive living environment and do not belong in the Job Corps 
program. 

Job Corps enrolls students who do not succeed in the public sector. Job Corps has 
provided education programs to address social behavior as well as educational train- 
ing, G.E.D.&apos;s, and vocational training for industrial jobs. Documentation can be pro- 
vided regarding the success rates of employment or further educational training of 
the students enrolled at Job corps. Of course, there are students who are not moti- 
vated to succeed and do not provide a positive environment for others. Where in the 
world is this not a true statement. It is easy to expound upon negative experiences, 
but please allow the many successful Centers, employees, and students to inform 
you about the positive results of the Job Corps program. I am proud to say that 
I woric at such a place. 

Please give Job Corps the opportunity to continue its motivational, positive pro- 
gram for the young people who need to continue their education and training. Job 
Corps is not a waste of taxpayer money and should be allowed to continue its work 
with disadvantaged youth. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Crisco Stahl. 



January 9, 1995. 
Hon. Max Baucus, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC 20510 

Dear Senator Baucus: Please include this letter as testimony in the upcoming 
Senate Hearings on the Job Corps Program. 

The Job Corps program has a center in Ronan, Montana, near to my home. I have 
personal knowledge of this center and how it is administered. Many friends of mine 
are employed at the center and the public is often invited to the center for art exhib- 
its, pow wows and business activities. 

It is my understanding that Kicking Horse Job Corps Center has a zero tolerance 
policy with regards to drugs and alcohol as well as violence. Students are sent to 
review board and terminated from the program if they cannot comply with these 
policies. 

The staff, faculty and administration at Kicking Horse Job Corps are caring pro- 
fessionals who do an excellent job educating and training disadvantaged youth who 
enroll. Many students have woriced for busmesses in the surrounding communities 
and have always exhibited good work habits and a good understanding of their 
trade. 

Please consider carefully the overall achievements of the Job Corps Program. It 
is essential to have this program to train youth who have &quot;fallen through the 
cracks&quot; yet desire to better themselves by succeeding in the work force of this great 
country. 

Sincerely, 

Ayleen Bain. 
Thomas P. Bain.

Hon. Max Baucus, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC 20510. 

Dear Senator Baucus: I am writing to ask that you have this letter included 
as testimony in the Job Corps Hearing. 

As an instructor for Sash Kootenai College I teach afternoon classes at the Kick- 
ing Horse Job Corps Center. In this position I have had first hand experience at 
seeing the benefits of the program. 



174 

I understand that the video tapes on the CBS report on the McKinney Job Corps 
Center will be part of the evidence used at the hearing. I would like to request that 
careful consideration to the rebuttal by Director Boswell be carefully considered. 

Even if the newscast were not misleading, I would like the committee to consider 
that it is highly probable that similar evidence could be found at any high school 
with the same number of students. We do not consider closing the doors on a public 
school if there are drugs, teacher molesting children or inappropriate behavior. We 
take steps to correct the problems. 

The Job Corps success rate is based on students that the public schools have 
failed to educate. 

Before closing the doors on the Job Corps I would Uke the committee to consider 
giving true test. Perhaps do an unbiased study comparing an equal number of stu- 
dents in the public schools and in Job Corps over a set period of time. Including 
beginning and ending pictures, documentation of behavior changes and employ- 
ability. 

I feel confident that if the committee could see the changes in students that I 
have seen at Kicking Horse Job Corps they would not feel that it is a waste of tax 
payers dollars. 
Sincerely, 

Maky L. Tevebaugh. 



John McKay, 
Irving, TX 75061, 
January 26, 1995. 

Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, 

U.S. Senate. 

Washington. DC 20510. 

Dear Senator Kassebaum: Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the 
Job Corps hearings by your committee on January 19, 1995. I believed my com- 
ments would assist in saving the Job Corps program. I left the hearing with serious 
concerns which I wish to call to your attention. 

After the hearings concluded, a Job Corps contractor stated to me, *Well, Pete 
Rell stonewalled his way through another one.&quot; He then added, &quot;It&apos;ll be business as 
usual next week.&quot; I further felt that Doug Ross simply was not aware of the serious 
problems that Job Corps was experiencing the past several years. 

The statistics Rell refers to are, at best, inaccurate and possibly fraudulent. There 
is a Job Corps National Office Review that reported to ReU that fraudulent records 
were reported by a contractor. Maryetta Cunningham of the Dallas Regional Office 
participated in this review and is willing to give sworn testimony to this statement. 
Maryetta has since retired and lives in Denton, Texas. 

During the hearing. Senator Kennedy offered a suggestion which referenced inves- 
tigators from Serjeant Schriver&apos;s office as head of the Office of Economic Oppor- 
tunity. Their mission was to investigate program problems and let him know of 
these immediately. If your committee, along with Doug Ross&apos;s office, selected a high- 
ly qualified. Job Corp-experienced, small group rf consultants which would inves- 
tigate all aspects of Job Corps problems prior to further funding, you would have 
creditable, updated information which your committee could use to make valuable 
and informed decisions. I do not believe that the 13 million dollar review of 30 cen- 
ters is a reliable vehicle for your committee. 

I have another suggestion if further hearings are held. Review all contracts made 
by the regional offices as well as by the National Office. Personnel actions taken 
by Rell should be reviewed, i.e., the action in Region 6 when Rell bypassed Levell 
Johnson, a black man with 28 years plus of successful Job Corps experience, for a 
person of no federal service and questionable performance at the center level. Many 
other personnel actions taken by Rell should be reviewed for Office of Personnel 
Management compliance. 

Senator Kassebaum, I wish to restate my support of the mission and the intent 
of the original Job Corps program. I believe a new approach through a federal-state 
administration, local oversight and input, and placement designed to meet the real 
need of disadvantaged youth without serious drug and/or criminal backgrounds 
should be supported with federal funds. 
Sincerely, 

John McKay.

Hon. Nancy Kassebaum, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC 20510. 

Dear Nancy: I am writing to inform you of the successes of the Northlands Job 
Corps Center in Vergennes, Vermont. I beUeve that you may find it useful when 
reviewing testimony from the Labor Committee&apos;s Job Corps hearing of January 19, 
1995. 

The Northlands Job Corps Center has been a success in Vermont and is commit- 
ted to providing Vermont&apos;s disadvantaged youths with the educational, vocational 
and social skills necessary to contribute in the community. Last year, over 38 per- 
cent of the students eligible for the GED program receive their GED before leaving 
the program, and 82 percent of the students were placed in jobs or signed up for 
additional educational programs. Of those students participating in the vocational 
program, 70 percent found employment directly related to tne training they received 
at the Job Cons Center. 

The Northlands Job Corps Center has helped Vermont&apos;s disadvantaged youths. 
Whether it is a safe haven from a troubled home or as a place where a child can 
learn and gain self-confidence, the Northlands Job Corps Center enhances the lives 
of its students. 

I appreciate you keeping these thoughts in mind when reviewing the Job Corps&apos; 
value. Please feel free to contact me if you have additional questions about the 
Northlands Job Corps Center. 
Sincerely, 

Patrick Leahy, 

U.S. Senator. 

Prepared Statement of Larry King 

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairperson Kassenbaum. Senator Kenned\&apos; and the 
other distinguished members of this committee for the opportunity to tesufy before vou toda%. M\- 
name is Larry King, Pm a 12-year employee of the USDA - Forest Service at the Pine Knot 
Civilian Conservation Center, located in Pine Knot, Kentuclo,&apos;. I also serve as the President of the 
National Federation of Federal Employees, Forest Service Council that represents 1 8 Centers and 
approximately 650 federal employees from across the nation. 

First and foremost, I would like to state that the Job Corps program is a much needed program. Vt&apos;e 
serve kids whom everyone else has given up on. We provide opportuiuty to those who have no 
opportunity-. We arc truly a program of last resort. I would also like to go on record in saying that 
our Forest Service Chilian Conservation Centers are the best managed and most productive 
Centers in the program. 

However, for the past five years, 1 have lobbied for change in our program. 1 have raised concerns 
regarding the way the program has been managed by the Dcpartmait of Labor. As protection from 
the many attempts to cut the program in the past, the Department of Labor has developed elaborate 
systems of statistics to justify the program&apos;s existence. While we felt sure that this was a necessary 
evil at the time, this has become part of the problem with our program. Center Directors are 
currently engaged m obtaining successful statistics at any cost, lliey are forced to do this; if not, 
tliey risk tlic chance of their Center bcuig closed by D.O.L due to low statistics. 

The single most disruptive factor is called A.L.O.S., or average length of slay. This single factor 
weighs heavily on how a Center is ranked by D.O.L. More often than not Centers keep gmdents 
who are disruptive, violent, and who are failing to progress, solely for the purpose of obtaining a 
high A.L.O.S. statistic While A.L.O.S. tends to be the key standard in ratmg a Center, other 
factors such as education, social adja&lt;ament skills, and vocation are treated as side is.&lt;&lt;ues. We now 
have a program which has been developed to produce nimibers, not to tram highly motivated young 
men and women, who are socially well adjusted and competitive in today&apos;s work force. I It is our 
feeling that A.L.O.S. was created primarily to justify the Contract Centers existence.&quot;) 

In recent years, the program has come under attack due to numerous negative incidents that have 
occurred on both Federal and Contract Centers, and the cost associated with the program. Most of 
the Job Corps population is obtained from inner cities throughout the nation. The program accepts 
those youth who are not fijnctiomng in our society for any one of a number of reasons. Therefore. 



176 

it is understandable thai the Centers are experiencing the some problems that have been oocumng 
in our inner cities. The A.L.O.S. statistic is a detriment to controlling the violence. &apos;V^■hile most 
students can be &quot;turned around&quot;, it must be recognized tliat evcrv- yoiitli tiiat comes into the 
program will not be siiccessfiil. Some students do not benefit from the program and conimue to 
exhibit violent behavior. Because of the A.L.O.S. requirements, these students are oommonlv 
retamed long after it has been determined they should be removed. 

While our student population has become more aggressive and violent, the Job Corps program 
itself still functions under a &quot;60&apos;s&quot; mentality. We function under what is conceived bv the rank and 
file as the &quot;poor baby&quot; concept. Centers arc not allowed to enforce discipline or maintain a 
productive atmosphere in which social development can occur. D.O.L. policy, in regard to 
discipline, reflect standards under which the students do not have to be responsible for their actions. 
Instead, centers operate under the concept that the student&apos;s background is justification for whatever 
actions the student takes. In other words, our students are not responsible for their pxjor behavior, 
society is. 

Program .Administration Charge: 

We currently have a D.O.L administration which highly favors the use of Contract Centers. It 
should be noted that when Contract Ccnleis were established they were run by major corporations 
to tram prospective employees. This is not the case today. Currently, anyone can establish a 
Contract Center. A Contractor&apos;s pmnary objeaive is to make mone\&apos;. not train students. 
Contractor&apos;s provide the minimal training environment needs for students, with profit dictating 
choices. In comparison. Federal Centers are set up to provide quality training, not to make a profit. 
The cost differences between the two types of Centers is not that great The quality of irdining, 
education, and social environments found at the two types of Centers, however, is strikingly&apos; 
different Federally operated Centers have, bv far. the best managed and most productive training 
environments. The additional cost of the Federal Centers is offset by the value of the projects the 
students produce dunng training. Specifically, students at Contract Centers are taught by building 
&quot;mock ups&quot; or simulated construction projects. Federal Centers teach students skiLs by actual 
construction of public facilities, such as Ranger Stations. Visitor Centers, and Job Corps Centers 
themselves. Many communities around Federal Centers have benefited greatly from projects 
completed by Job Corps students. 

We believe that tlie current D.O.L. Job Corps administration must change before any real progress 
can take place. In fact, we suggest a complete flush of the current D.O.L. Job Corps 
adimnistration, from the Washington level through the Regional offices. If the current 
administration and the philosophy is not changed, the program will never become a vehicle to 
effectively serve those who need it most the students and taxpayers of the country. 

This committee should know that this program is a good program — a needed program A 
program that serves kids whom no one else wants to deal with. A program that changes many 
potential dependents of the government into tay paying citizens We do make a difference in the 
lives of these kids. The public does benefit fixim our program in many ways. However, we 
recognize that we can and should improve. Recently, the Forest Service reorganized our national 
and regional Job Corps structure to cut overhead costs and streamiinc the organization. We the 
employees, and tlic N.F.F.E. Forest Service Council stand ready and willing to work with anyone, 
at any time, to improve the program so that h will truly be the best m the Nation. 

If eluninatmg Job Corps program in on the committee&apos;s mind today. 1 ask that you reconsider and 
help us put one of the best programs m the Nauon back on track. Ihe kids need it and the 
taxpayers deserve it Elimmating the program is not the cure, fixing it is. We need a program 
based on accountability, not acoountmg. 

Prepared Statement of Doug Ross 

Chairman Kassebatim, Senator Kennedy and Members of the 
Comni&apos;t&apos;ttte , I an pleased to have the opportunity to testify before 
you on Job Corps — a 30 year bipartisan initiative that is 
Anttrica&apos;s oldest, largest, and most conprehensive residential 
training and education program for unemployed and under-educated 



177 

youth- Designed for Amerioa&apos;s meet severely disadvantaged young 
people, the program breaks the cycle of poverty and dopondence — 
often multi-generational — by giving young men and women an 
opportunity to take responsibility for turning their lives 
around. It does so by providing a structured environment in 
which these youth can learn the self-discipline as well as the 
academic, vocational and social skills that are needed to become 
productive members of our society. 

Last year, Madam Chairman, you declared that it was time to 
review the Job Corps and ensure that it was using federal 
resources efficiently and effectively. Secretary Reich and I 
agree with you. And I am delighted to be here today to review 
the program&apos;s performance and discuss how we can make a good 
program even better. 

Job Corps has been a long-term bipartisan test of two 
critical propositions: 

• can a structured, disciplined residential environment that 
focuses on individual responsibility and preparation for a 

job empower large niimbers of young people from poverty 

backgrounds to turn their lives around and become productive 

citizens? 

• Does privatization work as an effective way to implement a 
comprehensive training program requiring carefully 
coordinated delivery of services to a severely disadvantaged 
group of young Americans? 

Based on rigorous evidence as well as the stories of hundreds of 
thousands of young Americans, we believe the answer to both 
propositions is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;. 
Perfom &quot;&apos;&quot;^&apos;* &apos;O verview 

In terms of its mission to provide opportunities for 
severely disadvantaged young Americans to take responsibility for 
their lives. Job Corps works. At any one time, the Corps serves 
over 40,000 young men and women, ages 16-24, all of whom are 
economically disadvantaged. Minority group members represent 70% 
of Job Corps students; 80% are high school dropouts; over 40% 
come from families on public assistance; and more than 7 0% have 



178 

never held a full-time job. Most come from neighborhoods plagued 
by high rates of unemployment, crime, welfare, illiteracy, 
illegitimacy and drug abuse. 

Since 1966, Job Corps has served approximately 1.7 million 
young Americans. Over this period of time. Job corp-^data^ 
indicates that 1.1 million or 65% have found a job or gone on to 
further education after their Job Corps experience. Last year, 
in PY 1993, 70% of all students leaving Job Corps were 
eucceesfully placed, and data for the first half of PY 1994 
suggests an even higher placement rate this year. We are proud 
of this record of success. But we taow that Job Corps can and 
must continue to improve if it is to earn the maximum rerurn for 
the American taxpayer. Indeed we believe that Job Corps will 
benefit from significant reform that I will spell out later in 
this testimony. 

It has been the policy of Job Corps to enroll the most 
disadvantaged young people — to deliberately take on the hard 
cases. These young women and men receive a wide variety of 
opportunities from the chance to attain a high school education 
to access to job skills in demand and a job. But the most 
important element of the students&apos; experience is the Job Corps 
expectation that they can succeed and the demand that they 
exercise the discipline that will lead to success in life. 

Fortunately, Job Corps has been extensively assessed. As a 
result, we have a clear understanding of the program&apos;s strengths 
and weaJaiesses, as well as its impact on participants and the 
benefits to society as a whole. 

Office of the. iBSpeetor General Audits aqd ABsessments 

The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor has 

regularly audited the Job Corps and assessed its effectiveness. 

The OIG&apos;s reports have consiBtently reflected the view that Job 

Corps, overall, is a positive program that works. At a hearing 

last week before the Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education, the 
Inspector General testified that &quot;this program can be an 

important tool in helping disadvantaged young men and women to 

turn their lives around and increase their economic earning 

power . &quot; 



179 

The OIG also has regularly offered recommendations for ways 
to improve Job Corps. As Secretary Reich mentioned in his 
appearance before this Committee last October, Job Corps has 
previously undertaken significant improvements in response to 
earlier OIG audit reports, and other improvements and changes are 
underway in response to more recent audit reports. These 
improvements, which started during the Bush Administratioh, 
include tenr.ination of specific center contracts when poor 
performance remained uncorrected, several revisions of 
performance standards, revision of eligibility documentation 
requirements, introductic.-. of a comprehensive student 
accountability system, introduction of vocational competency 
testing, implementation of performance standards for placement 
contractors, and consolidation of student allowance payment and 
data systems. 

We have recently developed a joint action plan with the OIG 
for continued program improvements. I will return to this later 
in my testimony. 

Job Corps Impact Evaluations 

While audits such as those of the Department&apos;s Inspector 
General are important for effective program management and 
maintaining the financial integrity of the program, they do not 
attempt to determine the return on investment or impact of the 
program. The Department wants to know — as does this Committee 
and the American public — if the total positive impacts 
resulting from the program outweigh the costs. 

We have turned to impact studies for this information. To 
examine the effectiveness of the Corps, a longitudinal study of 
over 5,000 youth was completed in 1982. This study was conducted 
by Mathematica Policy Research, an independent consulting agency, 
and analyzed a random sample of participants. The earnings, 
educational achievement, criminal records, and welfare dependency 
of Jab Corps enrollees were compared to the records of a 
demographically similar comparison group who had not enrolled in 
the Job Corps. These experiences were tracked for a period of 
four full years after graduation. 



180 

The evaluation found that Job Corps participation 
significantly increased earnings and educational attainment, 
while reducing welfare dependency and the incidence of serious 
crime among graduates. The study determined that there was a 
return to society of $1.46 for every $1.00 spent, including 
increased economic output of Job Corps students and lower public 
expenditures from reductions in welfare dependency and 
involvement in serious criminal activity. This return on 
investment is among the highest in federal job training programs 
— and for other domestic programs. 

Referring to this study, Professor Richard Nathan of the 
State University of New York, a former high-ranking official 
during the Reagan administration, recently wrote: 

&quot;Although this study [by Mathematical was completed some 
time ago, we have solid evidence that Job Corps benefits are 
still overwhelmingly positive. The basic performance 
measures of the program — job placement, educational 
improvement, etc. — have all been stable or rising since 
the program was evaluated. Furthermore, program costs have 
not increased since the evaluation, indicating the program 
is still cost effective. Finally, the income and employment 
of disadvantaged youth who do not participate in Job Corps 
have been steadily declining over the past decade. Thus, 
the assistance of Job Corps is more needed than ever. &quot; 
The Job Corps program has undergone changes and improvements 
since the original Mathematica study was completed in 1982. The 
curriculum and services provided have changed based on the 
additional decade of experience working with disadvantaged youth 
and employer involvement. We believe these changes have improved 
the program&apos;s effectiveness. 

Last year, the Department of Labor launched a new multi-year 
scientific evaluation of Job corps using random assignment. 
Although we cannot predict precisely the results of this 
evaluation, we believe that the result of the study will 
demonstrate public returns on investment at least as large as 
those found in the previous evaluation since Job Corps data on 



181 

student accomplishments and outcomes have been consistent or 

better since 1982. 

Bipartiaan support for Jcb corps 

Because of its consistently solid performance. Job Corps has 
enjoyed strong bipartisan support throughout its history. The 
Clinton Administration has pursued a 50/50 strategy — an effort to 
expand the capacity of the Corps by 50% by increasing the number 
of Centers by 50 in a graduated manner over the next decade. At 
the Corps&apos; 30th anniversary last year Majority Leader Robert Dole 
declared, &quot;It [Job Corps] gives young people opportunities they 
never dreamed of and makes them successful workers. They get 
back in the workforce, they do good things, they are on the tax 
rolls, the payrolls all across America. And I think this is one 
program. . .we ought to take a look at when we talk about 
expansion.&quot; 

During the last Congress, a bipartisan coalition recognized 
the history of Job Corps &apos; success in designing the new federal 
program of boot camps. It drew on Job Corps as a model for the 
boot camp education and training component as a way to give 
youth who have committed crimes a last chance. 
Job Corps &apos;■ A Privatiaed Program 

Privatization of Job Corps has turned out to be an effective 
way to ensure continuous improvement and to offer a means of 
dealing with low-performing sites. Currently, Job Corps has a 
network of 111 centers, with at least one center in all but four 
states. Thirty of these centers are operated by the Federal 
Departments of Interior and Agriculture. With only a few 
exceptions, the other 81 are operated by private for-profit and 
non-profit contractors selected on the basis of competitive bide. 

These private center operators range from companies such as 
the Teledyne and Vinnell corporations, (which have lajrge Defense 
operations) , to Management Training Corporation, (which is Job 
Corps&apos; largest contractor and whose primary business is Job Corps 
training) to the YWCA. Job Corps also depends on strong employer 
association and union involvement to run specialized vocational 
training programs. Indeed, Job Corps training is provided 



182 

through long-standing and effective partnerships between the 
business community, the labor movement, the for-profit and 
nonprofit sector and governmental agencies at all levels. 

Good contractor performance on key performance indicators is 
a condition for continuation of the competitive center contracts. 
Privatization has made it possibla to get rid of ineffective 
center management . Indeed, over the past 2 years alone, 21 
contracts have been terminated prior to the end of their maximiun 
5-year duration, primarily for reasons of poor performance. 

Job Corps &apos; history has been one of continuously expanding 
private contractors and reducing government-operated centers. In 
1976 slightly more than 50% of all centers were privately 
operated. Today 72% of the system is privately operated and 
competitively bid. We believe the privatization of Job Corps 
should be continued and expanded. 

Republican administrations have managed Job Corps for 20 of 
the program&apos;s 31 years and have led the program in a positive 
direction. The Clinton Administration is now seeking to build on 
that legacy and develop ways to further improve the program. 
Areas in Weed of Reform 

Despite Job Corps&apos; overall successes, the Chairman has 
eloquently and correctly pointed out that some areas of the 
program need to be improved. Last October, Madam Chairman, you 
reminded us that an oversight hearing on Job Corps was last held 
by the Senate Labor and Human Resource Committee more than 10 
years ago and that there is a need for a thorough evaluation of 
the program. You also expressed concern that the Department of 
Labor&apos;s Inspector General had identified different aspects of the 
Job Corps program that warranted attention and corrective action. 

Secretary Reich and I agree. 

Many of your concerns and those of other Committee members 
were triggered by audit reports from the Department&apos;s Inspector 
General. These audits were based on a review of Job Corps data 
to measure performance of various components of the program. 

The Inspector General testified at the October 4 hearing on 
its audit of Program Vear 1990 concerning Job Corps and reported 



183 

a number of areas that needed to be reviewed and assessed by the 
Departnent. These included: 

Failure of some students to obtain measurable learning 

or job placement gains. 

Failure to determine the post-program placement status 

of all Job Corps terminees. 

• A low percentage of training-related job placements by 
graduates and terminees — even though nearly 70% of 

all students did obtain jobs or go on to further 
education. 

• The fact that certain centers consistently performed 
below the national average and continued to operate 
with no signifioant improvement. 

Job corps co rrective Action 

At the direction of the Secretary, plans have been completed 
and actions have been taken or are underway to deal with each of 
these deficiencies. Indeed, practical corrective measures on 
most of the OIG concerns have been underway for some months. 
These measures included revisions in the Job Corps performance 
measurement system for PY 1994 as well as issuance of our zero 
tolerance policy against violence at Job Corps centers in June 
1994. 

We think it is especially important to note that the 
Department has moved forcefully to address problems at Job Corps 
centers where poor performance has been especially severe or 
persistent. In September 1994, after following up on complaints 
received by parents of students, we suspended new student 
enrollment at the Oconaluftee (NC) Job Corps center until 
improvements are made in the center environment. In December 
1994, after an in-depth review triggered by disturbing TV reports 
about the McKinnoy Job Corps Canter in Texas, we took action to 
terminate the existing contractor and install a new one. 

Also in December of 1994, we undertook a series of special 
onsite reviews to determine how effectively our zero tolerance 



184 

policies were being inpleinented. The first wave of revi«ve was 
coinpl«t«d at 28 centers before the holidays, including all 
centers where the potential for violence related problems was 
thought to be highest. All remaining centers will be reviewed by 
no later than mid-March 1995. 

This first wave of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; reviews resulted in: 1) 
formal notification to the current Cleveland (OH) Job Corps 
center contractor that, based on persistent performance problems 
and an assessment that the living and learning environment is not 
safe enough, the contract will be terminated and a new contractor 
installed; 2) transmittal of a letter to the National Park 
Service, citing chronically poor performance at all four of their 
Job Corps centers, asking them to &quot;show cause&quot; promptly why the 
interagency agreement for operation of these centers should not 
be terminated; and 3) temporary suspension of operations at the 
Joliet (IL) and Cassadaga (NY) Job corps centers to implement 
corrective action before the students returned from the winter 
break. 

We have also developed a joint OIG-ETA action plan to 
methodically address and remedy problems at our poorest 
performing centers. This plan will be implemented in the early 
months of 1995 and inoludes: 1) stronger emphasis on past 
performance when competitive contracting decisions are made; 2) 
conduct of an in-depth analysis of the poorest performing centers 
by OIG teams to identify common factors contributing to poor 
performance; 3) development of a technical assistance guide that 

will help center contractors and managers make more effective use 
of data reports to identify and remediate performance problems; 
4) provision of special training to key management staff at 10 of 
the poorest performing centers; 5) intensive onsite technical 
assistance at least 3 of the poorest performing centers; 6) 
establishment of procedures that will allow for accelerated 
termination and replacement of poor performing center 
contractors; and 7) development of a legislative proposal to 
permit oontraoting out the management and operation of the 30 
federally administered Civilian Conservation Centers to private 



185 

contractors where the agency has failed to perform adequately. 
In assessing performance, success in program outcomes, the levels 
of violence, and cost-related factors, consistent with the 
recommendations of the National Performance Review, would be 
considered . 

ETA also is ready to embark on a set of far-reaching policy 
and programmatic initiatives that will strengthen Job Corps 
student outcomes and Improve the cost effectiveness of the 
program. These measures include: 

1) Establishing an initial 30-day probationary or trial 
enrollment period for new enrollees during which a 
student would be expected to demonstrate a personal 
commitment to succeeding in Job Corps , and the labor 
meirket or leave the program. Corps participants would 
be expected to sign a written pledge to that effect. 
Job Corps provides students with an opportunity to 
change their lives- It is up to each student to take 
advantage of the opportunity Job Corps provides. 

2) Adopting a new requirement that new students be drug- 
free as a condition for enrollment in Job Corps. This 
is based on the premise that a student &apos; s commitment to 
succeed at Job Corps is an empty promise unless the 
student is drug free upon arrival at the Job Corps 
center . 

3) Restricting enrollment of younger students. In our 
discussions with the OIG, it was agreed that Job Corps 
should be viewed primarily as an avenue for 
disadvantaged young adults to move successfully into 
the leODor market. It was further agreed that, with 
high school age youth (17 year olds and particularly 16 
year olds) , it was more difficult to obtain a realistic 
commitment for labor market entry upon completion of 
the program. Therefore, ETA proposes to eliminate 
enrollment of 16 year olds altogether and to impose a 
15% cap on the enrollment of 17 year olds. 



186 

4) Reallocating existing resources to strengthen job 
placement and follow-up services. Currently services 
terminate with a student&apos;s initial job placement (which 
is defined as employment obtained within 6 months after 
leaving the Job Corps) . We plan to conduct follow up 
in the 13th week after the initial placement and to 
provide any additional placement services and support 
needed up to the maximum period of 6 months. We intend 
to make sure that the entrance into the labor market 
for Job Corps grads is permanent. 

5) Seeking legislative authority to ease access to social 
security and unemployment insurance data to improve our 
ability to evaluate longer term results of program 
participation. This will aid our ability to measure 
the Job Corps return on taxpayer investment without 
relying exclusively on impact evaluations. 

summary 

America has always defined itself as a country in which 
everyone must have the opportunity to take charge of their lives 
to pursue the American Dream -- especially the young. Job Corps 
is one of few ways we have created to make that opportunity real 
for the children of the poor. 

Unlike too many social service programs, Job Corps rejects 
victimization and demands responsibility. It deplores dependence 
and offers independence and self-reliance. And for those 
willing to work hard, it opens the doors out of a world of 
poverty, crime, and substance abuse into the American mainstream 
of work, family and citizenship. Boot camps offer a responsible 
last chance to young convicted criminals. It would be ironic if 
similar opportunities were not available to those from the same 
barrios, ghettos, and areas of rural poverty who were law 
abiding . 

The Job Corps mission of providing a &quot;second chance&quot; to high 
schools dropouts is more important than ever. The decline in the 
fortunes of Job Corps&apos; target population over th« period since 
the Mathematica study was completed ie distressing. From the 



187 

later 1970b to 1992, the employment rate among recent high school 
dropouts has plummeted from 50% to 36%. And those who are 
employed earn less. The real earnings of young high school 
dropouts who are employed full-time have dropped almost 25% since 
the late 1970s. And crime rates — especially violent crime 
rates — have increased among young people. 

The bottom line, Madam Chairman, is that Job Corps works to 
provide at-risk young people with a chance to take personal 
responsibility for their lives. It is not perfect. It needs 
further significant improvement as we have outlined today. But 
it works. 

In close collaboration with you and the other members of the 
Congress, the Administration is convinced we can make it even 
better . 

iFhank you.

Dear Senator Simon: 

I restate the need for continuation of liic Job Corps program as expressed in previous 
correspondence. Though the line viabiliiy of Job Corps is often overlooked, the need for this 
service is at an all time high not only to our country and state but also to Indian tribes. 

As Congress begins to evaluate Job training programs I wish to make known the significance of 
Job Corps to at-risk youth. I am certain you know of the staggering statistics facing young 
people today. hi)wever, national ligurcs aru increased and even doubled for Indian people. We 
consider Job Corps an effective solution to the problems of our area as we strive to become 
independent and lo shape our youth into solvent adults 

We extend our appreciation to you and your colleagues lor this review and express a desire that 
Job Corps continue lor the lie!:&apos;.-fu ot Ih&apos;; &quot;-.lulh ol&apos; our nation. 

Thank you for your attention and support

Dear Senator Simon: 

I am writing this letter to express my strong support of the Job Corps Program. 
I believe in Job Corps because for the last 30 years it has helped 1.5 million formerly 
disadvantaged young people prepare and prove themselves in the working world. 

The Job Corps program has helped thousands of at-nsk youth to break the cycle of 
poverty and welfare dependence by providing the vocational training and job placement young 
people need to become tax-paymg citizens. 

In terms of employment and economic development, 1 consider Job Corps one of the 
Federal Government&apos;s most effective programs. Constdenng the population it serves, it is 
amazing to note that a majority of ail Job Corps partiaoants get jobs, join the military or go on 
to further education. 

This modest investment in our nation&apos;s youth results in a return that is far more valuable 
than the dollars spent on the program. For 30 years. Job Corps has helped young people 
between the ages of 16 and 24 gain marketable skills, self confidence and good jobs. These 
young people are poised to support themselves and their families and to contribute to the 
overall productivity of our nation. 

Senator, I request that you take an objective look at all of the data, not just 
concentrating on anecdotal presentations. After examining more than 200 IG Audits, countless 
GAO reports, and the perfomiance statistics tracked by the Department of Labor, you will find 
that Job Corps works. 

Sincerely,

Dear Senator Simon, 

I understand that you and your committee will be holding hearings 
on Federal Job Training Programs in the near future. 1 would 
appreciate your consideration in leaving the Job Corp Program as is 
because of the following: 

1 . A Job Corp Center is located in my neighborhood and they are 
Great neighbors to me and my subdivison. It would take much more 
than a few lines to express to you the countless, positive things they 
have accomplished. 

2 The Turner Job Corp Center, Albany, GA, has 1030 students 
from all over the US They teach these students Academic, and 
Vocational Training, along with how to become a Positive, 
Productive, Taxpaying Citizen&apos;&quot; (we both know how important that is) 
3. As a war veteran, taxpayer, neighbor and entrepreneur, allowing 
the Turner Job Corp Center Program to remain a productive, cost - 
effective government training program would be most beneficial to all 
concerned 

*lt is cheaper to Educate than to Incarcerate!!&apos;

Dear Senator Simon: 



I am writing to share some insight with you concerning my support 
of the Job Corps program and my views as a police officer 
concerning the David L. Carrasco Job Corps Center in El Paso, 
Texas. 

During the Kennedy- Johnson Administration, the Job Corps was 
created to provide a vehicle for under-privileged youth to find 
hope and success through education and training. This program 
was an alternative to the formal educational system in each 



190 

community and El Paso, Texas, was fortunate to be the recipient 
of a Job Corps Center. This program provided our youth a great 
opportunity away from the negative influences in their community, 
helping them avoid the potential of engaging in criminal behavior 
or possible incarceration. I&apos;ve seen the results of falling into 
a pit of despair by dealing with the criminal element on a daily 
basis. 

The Job Corps Center, in El Paso, is the vehicle envisioned by its 
creators. It provides the avenues for hope and success for the 
youth of our community. This vision was also shared by the late 
David L. Carrasco when he opened the center in 1970. The 
community did not relish the idea. During its inception, many 
problems arose between police and Job Corps students. However, 
these problems were minor compared to the opportunity this great 
program has brought our community. This community understands and 
supports the impact Job Corps has made on thousands of young 
people, their families, and this community. 

Since 1971, I have been involved with our Job Corps Center being a 
police officer with the El Paso Police Department and more 
recently, as the Director of Public Safety for the El Paso 
Community College. Our community recognizes the need for this 
federally funded program. This enables the entire Center staff 
to energize its efforts towards student success rather than 
constantly seeking operational funds from local or state entities. 

Therefore, I urge you to examine your options. If necessary, 

cut the non-productive centers; but, leave the doors open to the 

future of millions of youth across the United States. I am 

confident your hearings will find Job Corps programs can be 

as effective as the David L. Carrasco Job Corps Center with 

effective leadership and great community support. Let the vision 

live! 



Respectfully ,

Dear Senator Simon: 



In view of your recent concern of the effectiveness of job training 
programs and knowing the great contribution that our David L. 
Carrasco Job Corps Center has made in our own El Paso community we 
write this letter. 

Through personal experience we know the benefits that our Job Corps 
Center training programs have brought to thousands of young people 
who were on a collision course to failure. The program offered 
corps members a second chance to becoming productive and 
contributing adults. The center not only assisted them with 
attaining job skills but offered a nurturing and caring family of 
staff members to support them through it all. As employees of the 
El Paso Community College we are partners in this endeavor of 
service to students. By the way, one of the Job Corps strongest 
aspects is the extraordinary support they receive from the 
community through active participation in the Community Relations 
Council . 



191 

Through this Council participation Armida Navarrete our program 
secretary and I have personally interviewed hundreds of these corps 
members over the past 10 years, getting to know them before and 
after their Job Corps experience. The effectiveness of any program 
is evident in its product, and the evidence are the placements. 
You may already know the Job Corps program here in El Paso is tops 
in the nation. 

We ask that you to please look at our track record and successful 
placement of graduates and plead that you continue supporting our 
disadvantaged youth the Authors of El Paso&apos;s and our Country&apos;s 
Future by maintaining federal funding for the David L. Carrasco Job 
Corps Center. 

With kind regards, we thank you for any consideration you can give 
this request. 

Respectfully .

Dear Senator Simon 

The NcNs ^ ciii bungs a big cliallciigc Ui llic loiili (. oiigicss loi cliaiigcs aiui icronii I 
believe that reform is very much needed However, you have to be careful how the reform 
is going to take place 

I am writing to you about the Job Corps I believe that the centers should be evaluated 
individually and find out whether they arc producing or not W||ather they are 
accomplishing their goals or not Weather they have the support of the community 
Wlfcither the students learn and arc |)lace in jobs 1 don&apos;t believe all centers should be 
penalized because some do not produce or meet then goals 

The David L Carrasco Job Corp Center in El Paso is one of the best in the nation The 
center has been recognized for a number of years 1 don&apos;t believe that this center should 
have its funding decrease or eliminated If they were not doing the job I would certainly 
favor cutting their funding 

Check with the Labor Department and find oui aboiil the center in El Paso 1 hope that 
you consider this suggestions

Prepared Statement of Jamison Gorby 

Hello, my name is Jamison Gorby. I am a student at the Red Rock Job Corps 
Center. I&apos;ve been there for five months. Lei me tell you about my 
background and how Job Corps has helped me. 



192 

I guess my worst problems began when I was 1 1 years old. I grew up in a 
small town called Cochranton. It&apos;s just south of Erie, Peimsylvama. This was 
way out in the country. When I was 4, my parents divorced. I was living 
with my mother, and she remarried and moved to California when I was 12. 
I just could never adjust to mj&apos; life out there because of the envirorunent and 
because I couldn&apos;t really accept my parent&apos;s divorce. 

I couldn&apos;t live at home. I couldn&apos;t take it So I hved on the streets. For 2 
years in California, I made my living by signmg. In case you don&apos;t know 
what signing means, it&apos;s when you stand on the street comers and hold up a 
sign that says &quot;will work for food or wages.&quot; I hved under bridges and inside 
of abandoned houses. I had no permanent address. 1 mowed lawns and 
painted fences. Because at the time 1 was too young to get a job. Today, I 
still think that many people have misperceptions about homeless people and 
think that they are out there because they don&apos;t try to better themselves and 
that they can&apos;t be trusted. 

It wasn&apos;t as dangerous on the streets as you might think. I had friends at the 
time, other people on the street who would watch out for me. We all had 
nicknames. Mine was Indy or Taz One day a man picked me up, fed me, 
and gave me a job working with him at a towing company. I stayed with him 
for approximately a year, and then he called my mother to come and get me. 
I was ready for a secure place to call home. She gave me a plane ticket to get 
to my father&apos;s hotise back in Cochranton, Pennsylvania. I was 15 years old. 

I really didn&apos;t know my father or his wife. It was a hard adjustment, 
especially with my stepmother. One night we had a fight and I left to stay 
overnight at the neighbors. The next day, a foster care social worker got me. 
After my foster home experience, I was moved to a group home called 
Bethesda, in MeadviUe, Pennsylvania, a town near Cochrantoa I was not 
used to such a strucmred environment and I still was unemployed. Then ray 
dad gave sole custody to my uncle. I moved once again, and tried to live 
with my uncle in Erie, Peimsylvania. He was a former pastor and history 
teacher and we could never seem to relate well. I worked temporarily at the 
country fair, and then I was off to another group home. Most of the time, I 
just felt terribly angry, but gradually I realized that I wanted to do something 



193 

more with my life. A friend told me about Job Corps. I really wanted a new 
start. I wanted something to turn me around, and help me wipe the slate 
clean. I wanted to get educated and do something with ray life — and get it 
right for once! 

Making the decision to enter Job Corps was a big step for me. 

I&apos;ve been at Job Corps for five months. In that time I&apos;ve earned my GED and 
I&apos;ve been chosen as Academic Student of the Month. When I compare Job 
Corps to the other places I&apos;ve been, I see that it is more of a challenge. I get 
to deal witli new people, and I have learned to live with different people. 1 

don&apos;t find Job Corps too stmctured — unlike a group home where we didn&apos;t 
seem to have any freedom or rights at all. I can still be who I am at Job 
Corps. I have the opporttmity to succeed because I have total support from 
everyone. 

This kind of support makes me feel good. I&apos;ve never had that in my life. It 
makes me want to push myself even more. I plan to complete brick masonry 
as a trade, and I want to get my advanced training in brick too. Then I&apos;m 
going to get a job. I adjust better now. I&apos;ve been to enough places and I 
know it&apos;s time to settle down. I plan to get a job in Pennsylvania. It&apos;s my 
home and it&apos;s in my blood. 

I still keep in touch with my parents, my uncle and some of my friends. They 
are all so pleased with my progress. When I eamed my GED, I handed it to 
my dad, and he had tears in his eyes. He said, &quot;See, we knew you could do 
it, with a little help.&quot; And thanks to God and Job Corps, I did it. 

Out of aU the places I&apos;ve been, Job Corps has been the only place to make 
such a difference in my Ufe and give me direction I&apos;ve never had. Even 
though I am young, I feel like 1 am speaking from years of experience 
because I have lived on the streets. I&apos;ve lived in foster homes, with relatives, 
with friends. But Job Corps is the first place I&apos;ve felt in control of my life. 
Without Job Corps, I would have to pick up my sign agam. 1 hate to think of 
that.

Dear Senator Kassebaum: 



My name is Harvey L. Arrowood. I have been involved with the Job 
Corps Program since 1979. I am currently the Regional Director for 
the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council Job Corps Project in Region V. 

On May 23, 1994 I sent Congressman David Obey and Senators 
Herb Kohl and Russell Feingold a plan that I believe, if 
implemented, would redefine Job Corps&apos; objectives and make Job 
Corps a model program for generations to come. I am enclosing a 
copy of that letter and plan for your assessment. 

I would like to go on record as saying that I support the Job Corps 
program with every fiber of my body and believe it to be one of the 
finest programs of its kind ever developed by the U.S. government. 
I have dedicated the rest of my working life to helping Job Corps 
attain the goals set down for it at its inception. However, in 
recent years I have witnessed a steady decline in the effectiveness 
and end product of the program. 

Job Corps is currently mired in a statistical chasm that will 
necessitate rudimental changes if we are to improve Job Corps&apos; 
outcome. These changes must take place throughout the entire 
spectrum that governs the program. 

I believe if left unchecked Job Corps will continue on its present 
path to self-destruction, having been placed, intentionally or 
unintentionally, in an environment in which no program, no matter 
how well conceived, could function. 

I am most encouraged by the recent national attention focused on 
Job Corps and applaud your efforts in making Job Corps a more 
efficient and responsible program. 

I would like to offer my assistance in this endeavor. I would 
appreciate an opportunity to testify at the upcoming sub-committee 
hearings regarding the Job Corps. I believe my 15 years experience 
and having worked in the program through four different 
administrations would provide invaluable testimony. 

I will avail myself to your requests. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Congress of the United States 
24 62 Rayburn House 
Washington, D.C. 20515-4907 

Attn: Kathleen Sykes 

Legislative Assistant 

Dear Congressman Obey: 

Please allow me a brief introduction: 

My name is Harvey L. Arrowood. I am currently the Regional 
Director for the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council Job Corps Project. I 
began my career as a Field Staff Representative responsible for 
screening and placement in northern Wisconsin. I held that 
position for 9 years. I was then promoted to Field Staff Liaison. 
In this position I was responsible for all communications between 
staff, management, and the U.S. Department of Labor. I held that 
position for 4 years. I have held my current position for the last 
2 years . I have a total of 15 years experience with the Job Corps 
program. 

Over the last 15 years, I have witnessed many changes in the Job 
Corps program. I am most concerned with the direction in which Job 
Corps seems to be moving. I feel the Job Corps has evolved into a 
program of statistics rather than a program of job training. The 
current emphasis seems to be geared toward placement. I think the 
emphasis should be directed toward keeping the students at the 
center long enough to complete their trade and/or obtain a G.E.D. 
certificate. Far too many youth are leaving the centers without 
training and/or G.E.D. certificates. I believe if we are 
successful in keeping the students at the centers longer, the job 
placement after training will take care of itself. I feel the time 
is right for a re -inventing of the Job Corps. 

I am submitting a plan that, if adopted, would move Job Corps 

successfully into the 21st Century. This plan is very cost 

efficient and can be implemented with a minimum disruption of 

services. My plan is as follows: 

An orientation center would be established in each region. In 
regions where large populations are present, there may be a need 
for more than one orientation center. These orientation centers 
could be one of the proposed new centers, or they could be an 
existing center. All newly incoming students would arrive at this 
center where they would be tested; counseled; receive a physical 
exam, psychological exam (if needed) , background check, suitability 
for the program, and possible G.E.D. testing. The student would 

remain at this center for 2 to 4 weeks. These orientation centers 
must be operated by an agency of the U.S. Government. I do not 
believe they could be successful if they were operated by a for 
profit company. 

The orientation centers will be the key to the success of this 
plan. Incoming youth will have an opportunity to feel the Job 
Corps experience; and, Job Corps will have the opportunity to 
screen out any youth who would not benefit from the program before 
enrollment at a training center. After completion of orientation 
center requirements, students would be sent to one of the Job Corps 
training centers in the region. These training centers must be 
specialized. 

I believe one of the most serious problems facing the Job Corps at 
present is the alarming number of students leaving the program each 



196 

week, or the WTR (Weekly Termination Rate) . The WTR seems to be at 
a much higher rate for younger students than it is for older 
students. Under the current structure, centers must try to meet 
the needs of all students. I believe this to be an improbable 
task. I feel the centers would be much more productive and obtain 
better results if they were able to specialize and be responsible 
for only a select group. 

I am enclosing an outline showing the proposed orientation center, 
trades at centers, and center restrictions. This is merely a rough 
draft. It is intended to visually depict an idea. 

If you feel these proposed changes warrant consideration, I would 
appreciate an opportunity to meet with you in person to further 
discuss this plan. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. 



Sincerely,

January 27, 1995 



The Honorable Nancy L. Kassebaum 
Chairman, Committee on Labor 

and Human Resources 
United States Senate 
Washington, D.C. 20510 

Dear Madam Chairman: 

This is in response to your letter of January 24 requesting 
additional information to be submitted for the record of the Job 
Corps Oversight Hearings. Our responses to your questions are 
enclosed. 

I spoke with Ted Verheggen of your staff and am eager to meet 
with you next week to set out next steps. We look forward to 
working with you to strengthen the Job Corps program. 




RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ON JOB CORPS 

Job Corps&apos; Zero Tolerance Policy on Violence on Centers 

a. What is the precise definition of this policy? 

A copy of the policy which was issued in June 1994 is 
attached. Based on the results of the on-site 
assessments underway, the policy will be supplemented 
with additional requirements as well as technical 
assistance material to share best practices in 
implementation . 

b. Is it mandatory for all centers? 

Implementation of a zero tolerance for violence policy 
is mandatory for all centers. 

c. What type of behavior is considered grounds for 
disciplinary termination? 

A student is issued an immediate disciplinary 
termination when convicted of a serious crime (felony), 
is confined under sentence for more than 60 consecutive 
days; or under judicial sentence, is banished from the 
municipality, county or State where the individual&apos;s 
center is located. 

Each center operator is required to establish rules and 
regulations for students and provide a role for student 
government in the establishment of the center&apos;s 
discipline system. In addition to the mandatory 
terminations noted above, disciplinary terminations may 
be issued for persistent disobedience of center rules 
or serious disruptive behavior that interferes with the 
interests and rights of students and staff, gang- 



198 

related activities, violations of safety standards or 
rules, coercive or assaultive behavior, and other 
instances of misconduct as set forth in the center&apos;s 
rules. Students who test positive for drugs and are 
required to participate in the Alcohol and Other Drugs 
of Abuse (AODA) program may be terminated for failure 
to comply with their behavioral contract. Due process 
for students in such cases includes a Center Reviev; 
Board, a formal decision by the Center Director for 
termination, and an opportunity to appeal an adverse 
action to the Regional Office. 

d. What is the policy regarding termination for violating 
the Zero Tolerance Policy on violence? Is it &quot;one 
strike and you&apos;re out&quot; or a more gradual approach? 

As noted above, it is currently the responsibility of 
each center operator to develop specific rules of 
conduct and sanctions for misconduct for that center. 
We are developing additional requirements designed to 
ensure that center disciplinary systems consistently 
address violent acts without imposing detailed 
procedural requirements from the Federal level. 

e. If Job Corps&apos; Zero Tolerance Policy was implemented in 
June 1994, why did the director wait until December 7, 
1994, to order immediate on-site inspections of 28 
problem centers? 

The Zero Tolerance policy was announced in June. On- 
site reviews were initiated six months after the 
issuance of the policy to ensure that centers had full 
opportunity to operationalize the policy and to enable 
full assessment of center implementation of the policy. 
The on-site assessments for high risk centers (16) were 
scheduled to be conducted right before the holiday 
break so that any serious concerns with the ability of 
center management to ensure the safety and security of 
students could be addressed during the break, before 
students returned in January. Additional centers were 
assessed prior to the holiday break; assessments 
continue and will be completed for all 111 centers in 
March 1995. 

2 . Job Corps Performance Measurement Svstem 

Several witnesses testified that these statistics have been 
manipulated by individual centers directors to give them 
more favorable ratings in terms of average length of stay 
(ALOS) , student terminations, GED, and vocational trade 
completion. 

The Job Corps Student Pay, Allotment and Management 
Information System (SPAMIS) was designed to ensure that 
centers are accountable for data entered into the 
database. The Job Corps Policy and Requirements 
Handbook contains specific rules governing inputting, 
changing and deleting data, especially those elements 
that may impact PMS (performance measurement system) 
reporting. These rules and required audit trails make 
abuse difficult. Specific information is provided 
below. 



199 

a. Is the system vulnerable to abuse? 

The system is difficult to abuse because of the system 
design that requires auditability of database data back 
to source documents, enforced by reviews conducted by 
regional Job Corps staff and audits by OIG staff. 
Other specific controls are in place as described 
below. 

b. Explain the Job Corps policies for ensuring that center 
statistics are protected from intentional manipulation 
or distortion. 

The Job Corps Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH) is 
very specific in defining procedures for areas and 
functions that may be vulnerable to compromise. In the 
functional area of student pay (enrollments, status 
changes, terminations, conducting pay, reporting non- 
pay statuses, etc) , the PRH specifically mandates the 
separation of functions and duties, ensuring that staff 
that enter information that generates pay are 
prohibited from distributing that pay. As for data 
integrity, the Job Corps has identified specific data 
elements that, if manipulated, could have PMS reporting 
implications. The PRH mandates that changes made to 
these data elements be authorized and documented by 
supervisory staff and that the center director, or an 
alternate designated in writing, sign the transaction 
print-out identifying the change. This document is 
retained on center and is a review item on regional 
office conducted reviews. 

c. What has Job Corps done in terms of oversight to 
improve the accuracy of these center statistics and to 
prevent would-be abuse. 

The Job Corps conducts reviews of center operations 
which includes audits of database data back to source 
documents. The SPAMIS system prohibits the changing of 
data after a specified period of time after 
termination, and since PMS reports are cumulative, any 
temporary changes made to influence short term PMS 
results would be correctly reported in the cumulative 
reports. We have recently began designing and 
developing software modules that will scan data to 
identify possible violations of policy as regards 
status change and termination requirements in specific 
cases. The results of our testing thus far do not 
indicate abuse in these areas. 



3 . Center Contractor Evaluation 

a. What are the most important criteria for judging a 
center contractor&apos;s performance? 

Performance against standards for reading and math 
gains, GED attainment, vocational completion, placement 
of all terminees, placement of vocational completers in 
training related jobs, average wage rate, average 
length of stay, and quality (including a safe learning 
and living environment) and compliance rating are the 
major criteria. In Program Year 1995, a student survey 
will be used to initiate a measure for customer 
satisfaction. 



200 

b. Do the criteria include A.L.O.S. and Weekly Termination 
Rate? 

Average Length of Stay is one of nine formal 
performance standards. Weekly Termination Rate was 
eliminated as a performance standard for PY 1994 
because it was being misinterpreted by some center 
directors in a way that was not in the best interest of 
students. Consideration will be given to eliminating 
the ALOS standard as well for PY 1995. 

c. If a center operator permits the actual number of 
students to fall consistently below the contractual on- 
board strength (OBS) number, can the operator be 
disciplined? Can the operator&apos;s contract be canceled 
if the OBS is not met on a consistent basis? 

Job Corps outreach/ screening contractors, not center 
operators, are responsible for recruiting a sufficient 
number of students to keep centers at capacity. An 
operator&apos;s contract would not be canceled because the 
center was not at capacity. Center contracts are Cost 
Reimbursement Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) , which means that 
the amount of profit (fee) the contractor receives is 
not dependent on the number of students enrolled . 

4 . Center Operator Performance Impact 

a. What role does a center operator&apos;s past performance 
play in the consideration of that operator&apos;s bid on a 
center? 

Past performance is one of the criteria used in the 
evaluation of proposals for center operations; this 
criterion is worth 15 points out of 100. 

Offerors submitting proposals for operation of a center 
must submit information on what their performance has 
been at other centers or, if not a current center 
operator, what their experience has been in related 
areas. Regional Directors solicit input from all other 
regions regarding an offeror&apos;s past performance and 
check references for offerors which have no previous 
Job Corps performance record. In looking at past 
performance, proposal reviewers evaluate this 
information as well as performance data of all centers 
operated by the offeror over the past 3 years, audit 
information, and center quality and compliance 
assessments . 

b. If a center operator loses a contractor for poor 
performance, does Job Corps have a policy to conduct a 
review of all other centers operated by that 
contractor? 

No. Each center, and each contract, is considered on 
its own merits. However, past performance is an 
important criteria in procurement evaluations. Poor 
performance in any of the other centers operated by 
that contractor would be identified in their annual 
review. 

c. The Department of Labor announced in early January that 
the Vinnell Corporation was awarded the contract to run 
the McKinney Job Corps Center in Texas. Please explain 
the rationale for that decision. What was Vinnell &apos;s 
performance record when it ran the Gainesville JCC? 
Why were they replaced by a different operator? Has 
Vinnell ever lost any Job Corps center contracts due to 
poor performance? If so, which ones and when? 



201 

Vinnell was selected to operate the McKinney Job Corps 
Center because the corporation operates the top 
performing center in the Dallas region (the Laredo Job 
Corps Center) ; they are familiar with the student 
population, regional economy, etc.; and they have the 
staff capability and resources to move in and take over 
operation of the center on short notice. The Job Corps 
Regional Director has confidence that the application 
of the successful approaches used at the Laredo, Texas 
center will address the problems identified at 
McKinney. 

Vinnell took over the operation of the Gainesville Job 
Corps Center in December 1989. The option year which 
would have become effective December 1993 was not 
awarded for performance reasons. The contract was 
extended for 120 days, until March 1, 1994, to allow 
time for a competitive procurement to be conducted. 
Vinnell lost the contract for operation of the center 
through this competitive procurement process which 
resulted in the selection of another operator. 

5 . Job Corps Admission Policy Change 

To be enrolled in Job Corps, the statute requires that a student 
&quot;...be free of medical or behavioral problems so serious that the 
individual could not adjust to the standards of conduct, 
discipline, work, and training which the Job Corps involves...&quot; 

a. Has Job Corps or the Department of Labor changed its 
policies so that students with behavioral and medical 
problems are admitted to the program? 

There has been no policy change. The files of any 
applicants who have a history of behavioral problems 
must be reviewed by the Job Corps regional office for 
final eligibility determination. The files of 
applicants who have medical problems must be reviewed 
by the Job Corps regional office in consultation with 
regional health consultants for final eligibility 
determination. These reviews are required to determine 
whether or not an applicant&apos;s problems are &quot; so serious 
that the individual could not adjust...&quot; 

b. If so, what was the date of the policy change? 
As indicated, there was no policy change. 

c. On whose authority was this made? 
N/A 

6. Sexual Discrimination Lawsuit Against Center Operator 

One witness at the hearings testified that a sexual 
discrimination lawsuit was filed in 1992-1993 against the center 
operator of the Laredo JCC. The lawsuit was reportedly settled 
out of court, and the plaintiff received a cash settlement of 
$165,000. 

a. Who was the center operator of the Laredo JCC at the 
time of the lawsuit? 

Vinnell was the operator at the time of the lawsuit. 

b. Who paid the cash settlement? The center operator or 
the Job Corps regional office in Dallas? Were public 
funds used to pay this lawsuit settlement? 



202 



An out of court settlement was paid from funds in the 
Vinnell center operations contract. When we questioned 
the appropriateness of such charges to the contract, we 

discovered that direct charges to the contract for 
legal and settlement costs were approved by the 
cognizant audit agency for this contractor, the Defense 
Contract Audit Agency. We are conducting research to 
determine if it is legally possible to include special 
provisions in Job Corps contracts which would make such 
charges as direct costs to the contract unallowable. 

Are center operators penalized for these kinds of 
discrimination lawsuits by Job Corps if the complaints 
are to be accurate? 

A center operator&apos;s performance in all areas is 
evaluated during center reviews and is considered as 
part of past performance in procurements. Any pattern 
of inappropriate personnel practices would influence 
past performance evaluations negatively.

FROM: 



PETER E. RELL

SUBJECT: 



Job Corps&apos; Zero Tolerance for Violence Policy 



As I stated in my remarks to the Job Corps Policy Forum on March 
9, the top priorities for the Job Corps for this year are; (1) 
Placement, and, (2) effectively dealing with violence on our 
centers. 

I believe these two priorities are directly related. If students 
feel threatened or unsafe at any center, they &quot;vote with their 
feet&quot; and leave before gaining any real benefit from the program. 

The evidence strongly suggests that the greatest single factor 
causing students to leave our prograim early is violence. 
Obviously, students who leave before completing their vocational 
training or, in some cases, their academic program, has a direct 
and very negative impact on our placement effort. 

Most of our centers have done an excellent job controlling 
negative behavior and provide a safe and secure environment 
for their students. 

However, given the rising tide of adolescent violence in many of 
the communities from which our students are recruited, we believe 
now is the time for our program to initiate a new Job Corps-wide 
effort to ensure that a safe and secure environment is the norm 
at all of our centers for all of our students. 



During the past several months we have had a number of 
discussions with Regional Directors, center operators, center 
staff and others who are involved with our program on the subject 
of how best to address the issue of violent behavior (including 
the threat of violence) in the Job Corps. In the course of these 



203 

discussions, the term &quot;Zero Tolerance for Violence&quot; has emerged 
as the most accurate &quot;label&quot; for the environment that we wish 
to achieve and maintain at all of our centers. 

While no one has objected to the concept of a &quot;Zero Tolerance for 
Violence&quot;, there have been questions about how we define Zero 
Tolerance and what are the specific implications for changes in 
policies and procedures relating to center operations. 

At this point, I propose that we attempt to &quot;define&quot; Zero 
Tolerance in broad terms so as to allow operators the freedom 
to decide for themselves exactly how to implement this policy 
at their centers. Again, at this point, I propose that we not 
attempt to mandate for each operator specific rules or guidelines 
for implementation of this policy on their centers. 

However, to establish some parameters, I would suggest the 
following required procedures for all operators: 

o All acts of violence or threats of violence will be 
aggressively and promptly addressed by center staff. 
No violent act or threat of violent act will be ignored 
or disregarded. 

o The Social Skills Training (SST) curriculum will be 
fully and consistently implemented at every center. 

o All applicants to Job Corps will be required to sign a 
pledge or statement at the application stage promising 
not to engage in violent behavior or threatening 
violent behavior while they are enrolled in our 
program. 

o The Zero Tolerance for Violence policy will be 

addressed early during the center&apos;s Orientation program 
and reenforced throughout the students&apos; tenure in the 
program. 

o Regional Office Annual Reviews of centers will closely 
examine the actions the center has taken to address the 
violence question. This would include, but not be 
limited to, specific questions on: student surveys 
addressing their perceptions of violence or the threat 
of violence; the role of the center&apos;s security staff 
and how effective they appear to be in ensuring the 
safety and security of the students; and, in general, 
what procedures the center has implemented to comply 
with the Zero Tolerance Policy. 



I recognize that some Regions, operators and centers have already 
implemented this policy and that interpretations of what the 
policy actually means ranges from &quot;one strike and you&apos;re out&quot; 
to intensive counseling for first-time violent offenders with a 
disciplinary discharge occurring only after the second or third 
offense. 

For the present, I am willing to allow for this diversity 
in interpretation if the alternative is to formulate a 
comprehensive, all-inclusive, detailed set of rules for the 
implementation of this policy which may not meet the needs of 
each and every center or even be sensible for the individual 
situations at each center. 

I look forward to working with you in the implementation of this 
Zero Tolerance for Violence Policy.

SUBJECT: Curlew Job Corps, Wauconda, Washington 
DATE: 01/26/95 

AFFIDAVIT OF CHRISTIE MILLER 

STATE OF WASHINGTON ) 

) ss . 
County of Pierce ) 

THE UNDERSIGNED, being first duly sworn on oath, states: 

This is my account of rape, attempted rapes, assaults, knife 

attacks, burglary, attempted burglary, drug dealing, drug abuse and 

theft at the Curlew Job Corps center at Wauconda, Washington. 

INCIDENTS 

Incidents that I either witnessed or had first hand knowledge 
of during and after my employment with the Job Corps Center. To 
the best of my knowledge no punitive action was ever taken by the 
responsible supervisors, Wayne Tapp and John Davis, regarding the 
incidents described below. In fact, the responsible supervisors 
have consistently attempted to cover up these heinous crimes, 
exposing both students and Job Corps staff to extreme acts of 
violence and danger. 

After the responsible supervisors, Wayne Tapp and John Davis, 
failed to take action, I was personally the victim of an attempted 
gang rape, the target of a knif e-throwi.ig student, the victim of a 
severe beating, and the target of a burglar who was practically 
naked. In each case Wayne Tapp and John Davis refused to either 
investigate or punish the students thereby encouraging future acts 
of violence. I was told by Wayne Tapp and John Davis that as a 

RAPE 

federal employee I did not have the same legal rights as a civilian 
employee. Furthermore, they intimidated me by threatening to 
terminate me and soil my employment record. I was single, and 



205 

solely responsible for the care of my infirm grandmother, who was 
wholly dependent upon my income for her survival. 

As a result of the physical and eniotional attacks upon me, I 
began to suffer excruciating bouts of anxiety, fear, and 
depression. Ultimately, the stress caused me to seek medical and 
psychological treatment. 

My treating physicians have diagnosed my symptoms as acute 
clinical depression, bulimia, and post traumatic stress syndrome. 
Since my receipt of medical disability compensation, my former 
supervisors, Wayne Tapp, John Davis, Robert Lynn Scott and Ed 
Schultz, have waged a war of retaliation, attempting to discredit 
my testimony and veracity. 

I am terribly afraid of further retaliation as a result of my 
testifying on the public record. Howe/er, I cannot allow what I 
have seen to go unrecorded. The Job Corps as it is managed now is 
neither a safe haven for needy youth nor a safe place for 
employees . 

DATE OF INCIDENT: On or about 10/27/86 

PLACE OF INCIDENT: Curlew Job Corps, Wauconda, Washington 

CENTER DIRECTOR: Wayne Tapp 

NAME OF VICTIM: Lawrence Clair Arial / Corpsmember 

NAMES OF ALLEGED PERPETRATORS: Corpsmembers : Robert McNeeley, 

Charles Spiker, Jim Wayne 
Muldoon, Lonnie S. Young, 
Edward Rudat . 

On 10/27/86 Lawrence C. Arial was sexually tortured, beaten 
and raped for over two (2) hours. The intercom security system 
which by Job Corps policy was supposed to be activated was not 
turned on. Furthermore, contrary to Job Corps policy, there were 
no Corps personnel in the vicinity. The attack included forced 
sex, masturbatory ejaculations on Arial &apos;s face and head, beatings, 
verbal harassments, ridicule, and future threats of violence to 
ensure that the attack would not be revealed. 

The residual effects of the attack devastated Arial &apos; s life. 
Contrary to Job Corps policies, no medical attention was given to 



206 

Arial . The Job Corps Center&apos;s physician was never called, although 
John Davis and Wayne Tapp were immediately notified of the 
incident. Arial was not taken to a hospital, nor did the Corps 
provide any services for recovery. 

Lawrence C. Arial was left to fend for his own physical, 
mental and emotional well-being. Despite the severity of the 
experience that Lawrence C. Arial had been subjected to, Wayne Tapp 
planned to put this young victim on a bus to Tacoma, Washington 
alone. Because Arial was one of my culinary arts students and I 
was his instructor, I personally drove him to his parents&apos; home. 

Contrary to Job Corps policy, Lawrence C. Arial was never 
given a CA-1 Injury Report to fill out. However, records of the 

attack should be part of the public record at the Ferry County 
Courthouse in Republic, Washington. 

It is my understanding that Lawrence C. Arial retained counsel 
from the law firm of Rush, Hannula and Harkins in Tacoma, 
Washington, and that a lawsuit was settled in his favor for an 
undisclosed amount. It is my further understanding that 
Lawrence C. Arial is still suffering greatly from the sexual attack 
and torture he endured while a Corps member at the Curlew Job Corps 
Center directed by Wayne Tapp. 

The leader of the attackers was Charles Spiker who had a long- 
known history of violence, and had previously nearly killed a 
Corpsman with a hammer. As the oldest student, he was a primary 
instigator of physical and sexual attacks. Many employees had 
attempted to have Charles Spiker dismissed from the Job Corps. I 
believe that the only reason he was not dismissed was to keep the 
enrollment numbers high to insure future Job Corps funding. In 
fact, I discovered that the Curlew Job Corps was deliberately 
keeping Corps members on the books long after they had left the 
center, or were terminated or were AWOL. Others who were ready to 
leave the program were discouraged from doing so. 

I questioned John Davis, Work Programs Officer, about this 
record keeping. Specifically, I wanted to know why those students 



207 

who had been terminated were still on the record. John Davis told 
me if tried to talk to anyone about this, he would &quot;nail me to the 
wall . &quot; 



RAPE 



In January, 1988 I was alone in ray office in the dining hall. 
Five (5) student Corps members came into my office. There was only 
one exit. One of the students stood by the door as a look-out 
while the others held me down and attempted to have oral sex with 
me. There was a lot of noise upstairs and no one could hear me 
screaming. I was punched repeatedly in the face, neck and chest. 
They attempted to grab my ankles, and tore my shirt off. They tore 
my pants down and attempted to have intercourse with me. I fought 
the best I could for nearly twenty (20) minutes and eventually 
succeeded in freeing myself. 

The memories of the incident have never left me. I 
immediately reported the incident to Wayne Tapp&apos;s wife, Nancy Tapp, 
who was a good friend of mine. Soon after, I reported the incident 
to one of the Corps counselors. The director, Wayne Tapp, was 
notified by both the counselor and his wife that I had been 
attacked and yet I was forced to continue to teach with the same 
students and I was provided with no further protection. 
Furthermore, no follow-up investigation was made nor were the 
students punished. 

KNIFE ATTACK 
A student Corps member by the name of Shawn Matkin, who had a 
known history of drug abuse and violence, attacked me in the 
kitchen with a knife. This was witnessed by Jim Windsor, Job Corps 
staff member. According to Job Corps policy, I immediately filled 
out an incident report and according to procedure, filed it with my 
supervisor, Al Reddicks. To the best of my knowledge, no measures 
were ever taken. I was provided with no additional security. The 



208 

student Corpraans was never punished and I was forced to continue to 
work in this dangerous environment. 

ATTEMPTED RAPE /BURGLARY 

Late one evening while I was alone in my trailer, a drunken 
student Corps member dressed only in his underwear attempted to 
break into three (3) different houses, trying to find me. He first 
broke into the cook&apos;s supervisor&apos;s house. He then attempted to 
break into Wayne Tapp &apos; s house and then Jerry and Alice Mitchell&apos;s 
house. Wayne Tapp&apos;s wife, Nancy, was terrified by this incident. 
When the Corpsman was caught a short time later by Wayne Tapp, he 
confessed that he was trying to find my home. 

To the best of my knowledge, no criminal charges were ever 
brought against the Corps member. Furthermore, contrary to Job 
Corps policy, no Incident Reports were ever filed by either Wayne 
Tapp or John Davis. 

BEATING 
Another assault that I suffered in the dining hall was by 
student Corps member Dean Troyer. Dean Troyer had started a fight 
in the dining room, and as a supervisor it was my responsibility to 
defuse the altercation. I instructed the other student Corps 
members to break up the fight. Dean Troyer came into my office, 
grabbed my arm, punched me in the face and chest, grabbed my arm 
again and slammed me into the door. There were over seven (7) 
witnesses to this incident. According to the Job Corps policy, I 
filed an Incident Report with my supervisor, Al Reddicks. Al 

Reddicks was so angry with me that he demanded I produce the 
original Incident Report which I kept in my files. I implored my 
supervisor to remove Dean Troyer from the dining hall. His 
response was to become angry with me for reporting the incident. 
Not only was Dean Troyer not removed from the dining hall, but he 
was also never punished. Later, he attacked another employee named 
Jan Clark. In spite of the fact that Dean Troyer had a long 
history of violence at the Job Corps Center, he was retained. 



209 

SEXUAL DEVIANCY 
As I was going down stairs to the kitchen in the Job Center&apos;s 
dining hall, a Corpsman named Wes Burchard started masturbating in 
front of me. I immediately filed an Incident Report with John 
Davis. Davis laughed and told me it was normal. To my knowledge, 
no action was taken at that time. Later, Wes Burchard was caught 
masturbating in front of another young Jtudent Corps member in the 
showers. It was only after this and other intimidating incidents 
that he was sent to a mental hospital for evaluation. I was 
informed shortly after that he had raped a patient at that 
hospital. It is my understanding that the Job Corps knew that Wes 
Burchard had a violent history and a criminal record. It is my 
belief that none of my Incident Reports of this individual was ever 
filed. 

ARSON 

Two (2) female cousins who were open members of the Tacoma 

Crips were allowed to enter the Job Corps. One of them was 

enrolled in the culinary arts program under my direction. There 

were many incidents to describe. However, the most dangerous 

involved one of the cousins setting fire to a mattress in her 
dormitory. To my knowledge, no formal charges were ever filed 
against this student Corpsman. As a result of this incident of 
arson and the failure of the director to take any criminal actions, 
I feared for my life. 

DRUG DEALING 
In the Fall of 1987, I was sent to northern California with 
approximately twelve (12) or more Job Corps members as part of a 
cooking crew to help fight the Seiad fire. We were stationed on 
the site for approximately six (6) weeks. As a supervisor of these 
Corps members, I discovered several individuals abusing and dealing 
marijuana, cocaine and alcohol. According to Job Corps policy, I 
filed Incident Reports on several individuals and called the Curlew 



210 

Job Corps Center and notified them of the violations. All of the 
Corps members admitted to abusing the drugs and alcohol and signed 
their respective reports. However, when the Corps members returned 
to the Center, Wayne Tapp refused to file these Incident Reports, 
contrary to Job Corps policy. 

When I returned to the Curlew Job Center from California, I 
was called into Wayne Tapp&apos;s office. At that time Wayne Tapp 
demanded to know whether I had ever drunk alcohol on the job. I 
denied the accusation and to my shock I was told to &quot;forget about 
the drug bust. &quot; 

Wayne Tapp&apos;s decision to ignore the drug bust had a serious 
impact on my safety and standing at the Center. This sent a tacit 
signal to the student Corp members that their behavior would go 

unpunished. This put me in grave dange* and soon after was when I 
suffered the above-mentioned rape. 

HEALTH AND HYGIENE VIOLATIONS 
In spite of the fact that I filed multiple Incident Reports, 
I was forced to work on shift with a student Corps member named 
Brian Yaeger, who wore his pants halfway down his buttocks. 
However, most offensive was Mr. Yaeger &apos;s hygiene. Often Mr. Yaeger 
had defecated in his pants and continued to wear them throughout 
his shift. Although I continued to file Incident Reports regarding 
these ongoing health, sanitary and hygiene violations, to my 
knowledge my supervisor never filed them. In another incident a 
student Corps member under my supervision complained of sickness. 
I sent him to the Job Corps Center&apos;s sickhall. The nurse denied 
treatment and directed the student Corpsman to return to work. We 
later discovered that the Corpsman suffered from hepatitis. As a 
result of this, over two hundred (200) people in the Job Corps had 
to receive hepatitis shots. To the best of my knowledge, the nurse 
directed Al Reddicks to have all students work whether they were 
sick or not. 



211 

MY SUFFERING 
When I applied for the Job Corps Center&apos;s position of Cook 
Instructor, the job description stated that I would be working with 
&quot;disadvantaged youths&quot;. However, the application interview failed 
to warn me that the disadvantaged youths with whom I would work 
alone and at night had long criminal histories of rape, assault and 
even murder. Furthermore, I was never warned that rape, beatings, 

burglary, theft, arson, drug use and abuse, alcohol use, drug 
dealing, sexual harassment and discrimination, and the fraudulent 
reporting of retention records and other documents would be a part 
of my Job Corps experience. These were daily realities of the 
Curlew Job Corps in Wauconda, Washington. 

I was never warned that by accepting this position I would be 
put in harm&apos;s way. I have never encountered such terrifying and 
horrific realities within a workplace. The blatant ongoing 
disrespect for human dignity which I witnessed in the Job Corps 
infrastructure has scarred me. 

Since the night of my first attack, I have suffered horrible 
nightmares, which continue to this day. The emotional and 
psychological damage I suffered as a result of the incidents at the 
Job Corps Center have disabled me. I have suffered from bulimia, 
nightmares, headaches, clinical depression, fear, and acute 
anxiety. 

Eventually, I was unable to meet my duties at the Job Corps, 
and as I began to break-down psychologically, my treating physician 
prescribed one (1) month of sick leave. I requested advance sick 
leave from Wayne Tapp. I was told by John Davis before I left that 
I could not discuss any of the problems that I had experienced at 
the Job Corps Center with anyone, especially Dee Wedell who was at 
the time in charge of the Job Corps Department of Labor in Seattle. 
John Davis warned me that if I told anyone he would make sure that 
it would backfire on me. Wayne Tapp also told me that I could not 
talk to anyone in the Union. 



212 

RETALIATION 

Contrary to Job Corps policy, John Davis altered my timeslip 
on one pay period that I know of. I was determined to file a 
grievance and expressed my concerns to an employee of the Job Corps 
named Sandy Evans. Unbeknownst to me, Sandy Evans was having an 
affair with Wayne Tapp, to whom she is now married. Sandy Evans 
warned me that if I filed a grievance, that Wayne Tapp and John 
Davis would fabricate false information and do anything to hurt me. 

When Wayne Tapp learned that I was filing for Worker&apos;s 
Compensation, he told me that if I applied for Worker&apos;s 
Compensation, it would &quot;hurt my work record&quot; and he &quot;would not 
under any circumstances ever pay for someone not to work.&quot; During 
this last meeting with Wayne Tapp and John Davis, I was also told 
that I should, &quot;quit my job and go on food stamps.&quot; Once again I 
was warned not to apply for Worker&apos;s Compensation. Contrary to Job 
Corps policy and federal law, Wayne Tapp refused to file my 
Worker&apos;s Compensation claim. It was not until William Howard of 
the Office of Worker&apos;s Compensation (OWCP) in Seattle warned Wayne 
Tapp at least twice of the legal ramifications for not filing a 
claim, was the claim filed, after two and one half months. 

Almost immediately after I was gone on sick leave, Wayne Tapp 
and John Davis broke into my locked file cabinet and stole my 
personal files, and confidential records, including medical 
records. Furthermore, many copies of my Incident Reports were 
taken as well. When I confronted John Davis on the telephone about 
his breaking into my personal files, he told me, &quot;I can break into 
anything I want at any time.&quot; They did not know that I had copies 
of my daily notes, including several of the Incident Reports and 

records which disappeared from my personal file. Those records 
have never been returned, despite reperted requests to John Davis 
and Wayne Tapp. 



213 

CONCLUSION 

The Job Corps knowingly and willingly receives gang members, 
criminals, sociopaths and sexual deviants within their program. 
However, the Job Corps fails to inform their employees that these 
individuals are anything other than &quot;disadvantaged youths.&quot; The 
Job Corps knowingly and willingly continues to alter and inflate 
student roster lists. Students who have exhibited continued acts 
of violence remain undisciplined, uninvestigated and unrecorded so 
that the Job Corps may maintain their inflated rosters. 

I continue to suffer as the result of the experiences at the 
Job Corps Center. At this time, I continue to be the subject of 
continued harassment and retaliation by members of the Job Corps 
Center and the U.S. Forest Service. It is my understanding that my 
confidential personnel files and medical records including the 
progress notes of my psychological therapy have been disseminated 
to these institutions without my permission or knowledge. After 
nearly seven (7) years from the date of these incidents I continue 
to suffer from the attacks and retaliation of Job Corps 
representatives who at this time have begun to wage a new war to 
deny me Worker&apos;s Compensation benefits. Their preposterous 
contention is that my testimony is a complete fabrication. Should 
this investigation request further information, I am prepared to 
provide complete documentation including names, addresses, social 
security numbers and dates of birth of perpetrators, and names of 



214 

witnesses to all of the aforementioned incidents, including some 
copies of the Incident Reports which disappeared from the stolen 
files in my office.
