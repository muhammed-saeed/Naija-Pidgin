Gentlemen:

This is my fourth order with your company. We have been so pleased with the cling sets.

We live in a senior housing community and it has been a pleasure to see how much joy it brings to the people to have us decorate their windows.

Thank you for your prompt service,

Jack and Delores Johnson

Dear Super Signs,

I have used your Christmas window clings for 17 years now! They were a gift to us when my daughter was 2. She’s 19 now and we still put them up every year, (“we”being she and her 2 younger brothers). They are so colorful and cling as well as the first year we used them.

I am now ordering some for my nephew and his young family and hope they will enjoy them for years to come. I recognized many of the designs in the ad and saw some new ones–well,“new”since 17 years ago.

The quality of your product is amazing and something very rare nowadays. I have thanked my friend many times over the years for her wonderful gift. Now I am thanking you also.

Keep up the good work. You have become a part of many people’s holiday traditions.

Sincerely,

Jenny Haggerty

Super Signs,

We recently purchased and received nine sets of your super signs–We are delighted with them. They are for each of our nine children.

Now we are buying eight additional sets, one for each of our grandchildren who are married and living in their own homes.

Sincerely,

To Whom This May Concern:

I received my two autumn kits today, and I was very impressed with the print quality. It is obvious that pride is taken in each little picture. This is why I am ordering two more different kits, and telling everyone I know.
In high school I took graphic arts and majored in Vinyl Design. I know how hard it can be to work with vinyl. I have two years experience with making signs, stickers, window decals, etc. If Super Signs ever comes to Las Vegas, NV, it would be my pleasure to help. I currently work at In-N-Out Burger (a fast food restaurant) that takes pride in everything they do. The company has been around since 1948 and has never lost touch with its quality, freshness, and customer service. These three things are apparent in your company. That is what draws me to write this letter. I am impressed and thank each and every person at Super Signs!!
A HAPPY CUSTOMER

Dear People,

I just wanted to let you know that this Christmas will be the 6th year I have put up my window clings from your company. I’m very careful with them and they still look like new. I’m ordering now so I can give them as gifts. You do a terrific job.

Thank you,

Dearest Barry,

I can NOT say thank you enough for the lovely decals and extras that you sent to me. As I had said, I am in a wheelchair and I need help in putting the decals up on the windows and my medicine cabinet.
My sweet cousin and I just have fun arranging the decals.

The BEAUTIFUL Easter decals with some of the birds and fish were perfect. Being an animal lover, I can’t wait to put the animal decals up for the summer, along with my 4th of July decals.
You are SOOOOO kind and I thank you so very much.

Per our conversation about the Nativity scenes, which I will order in September as you suggested, I’m anxious to order them.

Barry, being alone, the decals just help to brighten up my apartment.
Thank you again!!!
Lord willing, I’ll be in touch with you in September or there abouts.

Very sincerely,

Dawn Kidd

Thank you for the opportunity to try these fun, yet gorgeous window clings. I am unable to fix up a“Christmas”house like I used to because of Rheumatoid Arthritis, but these colorful clings will really brighten and bring cheer.
I can hardly wait till they get here–I am excited! Again thank you–my Great-granddaughter, age 4½is all excited as well.

Merry Christmas and a Blessed New Year.

Hi Folks…

I just wanted to let you know that I just love your Window Clings. They are just wonderful. I have never had any fall off, they are so colorful, and I have received many compliments after decorating.

So keep up the good work–I am so glad I found you.

Sincerely,

Ellie Waggoner
 
Dear Barry,

I just received my order of window clings a couple of days ago, including the free set of stained glass clings you offered for me to try.

I immediately cleaned a couple of windows and put up a couple of the stained glass clings.

They are beautiful. We have a lot of homes in this area that have real stained glass in some windows. I myself have a stained glass window in my bathroom. The stained glass clings compare very favorably with the“real thing.”As a matter of fact, the clings have much more vibrant colors and really“come alive”when the sun is bright. The clings I used are in southern-facing windows where the sun lights them up most of the day.

These stained glass clings will be a wonderful addition to the other designs you offer. As a matter of fact, I believe they will be very popular. The designs are classic and the colors are wonderful. They definitely brighten up a window space.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try them.

Sincerely,

Cheryl Kawalek

Dear Super Signs Inc.,

My name is Debby K. I bought a kit of Christmas clings 26 years ago. I’ve raised three kids and every year I have used your window clings. This year I looked in my Christmas boxes and noticed there were no clings. But, after all these years I still had the reorder form and I was wondering what you now charge? I loved them and would like to get another set. If you can let me know I would very much appreciate it. I am sending along the order form–I know the price has changed (from $15), but please let me know how much so I can replace the one that disappeared.

Thank you,

Debby Kirby
 
Dear Super Signs–

Loved the colorful flier. Three things caught my eye: price,“reusable,”and“Made in the USA.”If you have a website, you might consider adding that, but the cheerful lady holding two clings made me trust your claims!!

I’ve had my set of window clings for many years and used them to decorate my granddaughter’s windows. Now that my youngest granddaughter helps me put them up–they end up on any piece of glass or mirror, she thinks it’s great, especially the Christmas ones, she makes her own scenes.

She puts the little tree in the middle of all the houses like a street scene. I’ve lost one snowflake after all these years.

I like my clings cause they still cling after all these years. I see you have a few new ones?

Pepper Seibert
 
Thank you so much for your beautiful stickers! I am sending your website to all of my relatives. So, I’m hoping you will soon hear from other Mendoza’s, the Garcia’s, Herrera’s, Griffith’s, etc.

May God Bless You
