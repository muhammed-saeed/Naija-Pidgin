New restaurant owners need to be meticulous about food safety, especially right before they open. Restaurants cannot open without passing rigorous inspections and adhering to strict local health codes. Before you apply for your business permit and invite your county&apos;s food safety board for a inspection, take the time to make sure the food in your restaurant is safe.
 
Significance

Food safety is crucial to opening a new restaurant and to keeping it running. All restaurants must pass a county restaurant inspection that focuses heavily on food safety prior to opening. Restaurants that do not meet strict health code requirements are not allowed to open.
 
Regulations

Whether you’re opening your restaurant in a small town or a booming metropolis, you must obtain a permit from your local health department certifying that your restaurant has met county, state and federal requirements. You’ll need to submit an application around a month prior to opening. While health codes vary depending on location, all codes require restaurants to safely handle, store and prepare food. They will also require employees to maintain good hygiene. Restaurants are usually inspected once every two years after opening.
 
Considerations

It’s important to understand that food borne illnesses can be caused by foods contaminated by viruses, parasites, bacteria or chemicals. Food may arrive contaminated or become contaminated once it is touched by humans, utensils or other foods. For example, if thawing meat drips onto salad that doesn’t require cooking, bacteria from the uncooked meat could contaminate the salad. Equipment that is not kept clean can also cause food safety problems. Require employees to wash their hands frequently and clean equipment and utensils meticulously after use. Properly refrigerate all food and check for doneness with a thermometer. Designate different preparation areas for different types of food. Store chemical cleaning supplies, pesticides and food additives far from food.
 
Warnings

Knowing your local health codes can prevent you from experiencing trouble when opening a new restaurant. Get a copy of your county’s health code to make sure your restaurant meets specific standards. Keep in mind that you must follow health codes to the letter. They often include very specific requirements such as specific cleaners and sanitizers that can be used and how often equipment and surfaces must be cleaned or sanitized. Health codes may require employees to wear gloves and avoid touching prepared foods with their own hands. If your restaurant violates any of the requirements in the health code during inspection, you will not be allowed to open. Make sure to apprise your employees of the specifics of the code.
 
Expert Insight

According to the Food Reference article “Restaurant Food Safety--Critical For Success,” “It is obvious that the restaurant industry…must train all food handlers more vigorously, hire healthy individuals and take every possible precaution to serve wholesome foods. This will cost but it is better to be safe than sorry…Managers just need to implement a well-thought-out education seminar, then maintain standards.”
