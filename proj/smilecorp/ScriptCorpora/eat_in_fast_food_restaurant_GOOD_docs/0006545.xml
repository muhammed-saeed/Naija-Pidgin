Read the newspaper article Boston Chicken Gets Math Lesson shown below and answer the questions that follow.
Boston Chicken Gets Math Lesson
The Associated Press As a math teacher, Bob Swain of Golden, Colo., was suspicious when he saw a Boston Chicken television ad proclaiming the fast-food restaurant offers ???? dinner combinations. He and his students at Souderton Area High School did some figuring and came up with the number ??? instead. Then Boston Chicken Inc. did some figuring.&quot;We checked, and sure enough, there was a mistake in our combination,&quot;said Gary Gerdemann, a spokesman for the fast-food chain. The ad, which stars quarterback Joe Montana, will be corrected this week. In the ad, an announcer claims customers choosing three of its 16 side dishes and combining them with dinners can come up with ???? different combinations.&quot;If anyone uses the word &apos;combinations,&apos; it&apos;s like a trigger for me,&quot;Swain said Tuesday.&quot;I always check.&quot;Boston Chicken is giving the school&apos;s math department a $500 grant and feeding Swain and his class.
(i) The incorrect number of possible dinners claimed by Joe Montana in the ad, indicated by ???? in the article&apos;s first sentence and in the 4th sentence from the
article&apos;s end, resulted from Joe calculating the number of permutations when selecting 3 different side dishes from the 16 available choices. What was the incorrect number stated by Joe Montana in the ad? (DO NOT use commas to separate the digits in your answer).3360 3360
(ii) Suppose a customer chooses 3 different side dishes from the 16 available choices. How many side-dish combinations are possible? (Is order important?)560 560
(iii) Suppose&quot;double-servings&quot;are allowed. So, for example, if you like mashed potatoes, you can get a double-helping of mashed potatoes (this counts as 2 sides), then you select a single helping of a different dish for your third side. How many ways can a customer choose his or her 3 side dishes by choosing a double serving of 1 side and a single serving of a different side? 240 240
(iv) Suppose&quot;triple-servings&quot;are allowed. So, for example, if you really like mashed potatoes, you can get a triple helping of mashed potatoes, and this counts as your 3 side dishes. How many ways can a customer choose his or her 3 side dishes by choosing a triple serving of 1 side dish? 16 16
(v) The high school students assumed that if a customer pays for 3 sides, the customer selects 3 sides; in addition, they assumed that duplication (that is,&quot;double-servings&quot;and&quot;triple-servings&quot;) are allowed. Can you get the correct answer for the number of possible dinners (indicated by ??? in the article&apos;s second sentence) that the high school students obtained? What is the correct number? 816 816

The Relationship Between Odds and Probabilities
If the odds in favor of an event A are a to b, then P(A)=a/a+b. For example, if the odds of an earthquake in San Francisco during the next 10 years are 3(=a) to 1(=b), then P(earthquake)=3/4. If the probability of an event A is P(A), then the odds in favor of A are P(A) to 1 - P(A). So if a handicapper assesses a probability of .25 that the racehorse Seabiscuit will win the third race at the Hialeah racetrack in Miami, then the odds in favor of Seabiscuit are .25 to .75, or 1 to 3. It follows that the odds against A are 1 - P(A) to P(A), or 3 to 1 against a win by Seabiscuit. Sports Columnist Jerome Holtzman of the Chicago Tribune wrote an article about the rarity of no-hitters in major league baseball. The article offered the following statement:&quot;There have been an estimated 126,000 games played, or 252,000 pitching opportunities for a no-hitter and there have been 182 no-hitters. Therefore the odds against a no-hitter are ???? to 1.&quot;Use the first on paragraph odds and probabilities to find the number that should be inserted for ???? in the newspaper article to show the odds against a nohitter. NOTE: a&quot;no-hitter&quot;occurs in baseball when one team does not get any hits in the entire game. (HINT: find the probability of a no hitter rounded to 7 decimal places; use this probability to find the odds against a no-hitter; round your answer to the nearest whole number. Note also that each of the 126,000 games has TWO starting pitchers, so 252,000 pitchers have the opportunity to pitch a no-hitter).
The odds against a no-hitter are 1384 Solution or Explanation
1384 to 1.
Probability of no hitter: Odds against no hitter: (1-.0007222) to .0007222, or
.9992778 to .0007222, or 1383.657989 to 1; rounding gives 1384 to 1.

A Probability-Guided History of the National Basketball Association Player Draft.
In June the National Basketball Association (NBA) conducts its annual player draft. Each team drafts (selects) a player not yet in the NBA to be a player on their team. The order in which the teams select the players is extremely important (see first picks in 1985 and 1992 mentioned below; see NBA Lottery Picks for a list of all players selected in the NBA draft lottery through 2006 since the system was instituted in 1985; see 2007 NBA Draft for the players selected in the 2007 draft). The order of selection is determined by a lottery drawing conducted approximately four weeks prior to the June draft; see 2007 NBA Draft Lottery News and 2007 NBA Draft Lottery Results to read about the 2007 NBA Draft Lottery held May 22, 2007. Click here to read the 2007 lottery losers&apos; complaints that&quot;probability&quot;is not fair. To maintain competitive balance among the teams, the NBA allows the weaker teams to select players first, in the hope that the weaker teams get the best new players. Over the years a variety of probability-based techniques have been used by the NBA to determine the draft order. Prior to 1985, the last-place finisher in the Western Conference and the lastplace finisher in the Eastern Conference would flip a coin to determine which team selected first and which team selected second. In 1985 a lottery system was started to prevent the teams with the worst records from automatically receiving the first two picks; this was to prevent teams from intentionally losing
games to gain a top draft pick. In this lottery system, each of the seven teams that failed to make the post season playoffs (the seven worst teams) had an equal chance of drafting first. The first year was a memorable one as the New York Knicks won the first pick and selected 7-foot center Patrick Ewing from Georgetown University. Instant success: Ewing led the Knicks to the playoffs 13 times in his 15-year career. Question 1. What was the probability that the New York Knicks would win the first pick in the 1985 draft? 0.143 .143 (Use 3 decimal places in your answer).
After a few seasons, critics pointed out that the first selection in the draft very seldom had been awarded to the worst or second-worst team in the league. As a result, in 1990 the NBA changed the draft lottery to a weighted probability system. By 1990 there were 28 teams in the NBA and 17 teams made the playoffs. The eleven worst teams that did not make the playoffs would be given the opportunity to choose early in the draft. This was accomplished by the assignment of weights to the eleven non-playoff teams. The team with the worst record during the regular season received a weight of w11 = 11, the secondworst team received a weight of w10 = 10, the third-worst team received a weight of w9 = 9, and so on; the team with the best record among the 11 nonplayoff clubs received a weight of w1 = 1.
In 1992 the Orlando Magic had the second-worst record (21-61) in the league and thus were assigned the weight w10 = 10. They won the first pick in the draft lottery and selected monster 7&apos;1&quot;center Shaquille O&apos;Neal from LSU. With&quot;Shaq&quot;on the team, Orlando improved to 41-41 the next season and just missed the playoffs. So in the 1993 draft lottery, Orlando was assigned the weight w1 = 1 since they were the best of the eleven non-playoff teams. The
Orlando Magic again won the first pick! They selected forward Chris Webber from the University of Michigan. Question 2. What was the probability that the Orlando Magic would win the first pick in the 1992 draft lottery? 0.152 .152 (Use 3 decimal places in your answer).
Question 3. What was the probability that the Orlando Magic would win the first pick in the 1993 draft lottery? 0.015 .015 (Use 3 decimal places in your answer).
The probability-challenged NBA executives did not fully comprehend the rarity of the occurrence of Orlando winning the first pick in the 1993 draft, so the system was changed yet again. For the 1994 draft, 14 balls numbered 1 through 14 were placed in a drum, and 4 were chosen without replacement; the order in which the balls were drawn made no difference. Question 4. How many ways can 4 balls be selected from 14 numbered balls if the balls are selected without replacement and order makes no difference? 1001 1001 (Do not use a comma to separate the digits in your answer).
To determine the draft order in all player drafts since 1994, one of the possible configurations of 4 numbered balls in question 4 is discarded and the remaining configurations are allocated to the non-playoff teams based on their order of finish during the regular season (in the 28-team NBA in 1994 and 1995 there were 11 non-playoff teams; in the 30-team NBA from 1996 to 2003 there were 13 non-playoff teams; since 2004 when the Charlotte Bobcats were added, there have been 14 non-playoff teams). The draft order is then determined as follows: 4 balls are randomly selected without replacement from the 14 numbered balls; the team that has been assigned those 4 numbers receives the number one pick
the 4-number configurations that were assigned to the team awarded the number one pick are excluded from further consideration the 4 balls that determined the number one pick are placed back in the drum; 4 balls are randomly selected without replacement from the 14 numbered balls until a non-excluded 4-number configuration determines which team is awarded the number two pick the 4-number configurations that were assigned to the team awarded the number two pick are excluded from further consideration the 4 balls that determined the number two pick are placed back in the drum; 4 balls are randomly selected without replacement from the 14 numbered balls until a non-excluded 4-number configuration determines which team is awarded the number three pick (Note: If the one discarded 4-number configuration that is not assigned to any team is drawn, the 4 balls are placed back in the drum and another selection of 4 balls is made.) Question 5. If the NBA wants the non-playoff team with the best record to have a .005 probability of winning the first pick in the draft, how many 4-number configurations should be assigned to this team? (remember that one of the possible 4-number configurations from question 4 is not used) 5 5
Suppose that in the 2008 lottery the NBA assigns the 4-number configurations so that the team with the worst record had a .25 probability of winning the first draft pick, the team with the second-worst record has a .20 probability of winning the first draft pick, and the team with the third-worst record has a .157 probability of winning the first pick. Question 6. Suppose the first 4-number configuration drawn in 2008 is a configuration that has been assigned to the team with the third-worst record; therefore the team with the third-worst record would be awarded the first pick in the draft. What is the probability that the team with the worst record is awarded the second pick in the draft? 0.297 .297 (Use 3 decimal places in your answer).
Solution or Explanation
Question 1. P(New York Knicks awarded first draft pick) =
= .143
Question 2. Note that 11+10+9+... +2+1 = 66. Therefore P(Orlando Magic awarded first draft pick in 1992) = = .152
Question 3. Note that 11+10+9+... +2+1 = 66. Therefore P(Orlando Magic awarded first draft pick in 1993) = Question 4. 14C4 = 1001 Question 5. There are 1000 4-number configurations allocated to the 11 nonplayoff teams based on their regular season finish. 5 configurations should be assigned to the non-playoff team with the best record, since then P(best nonplayoff team awarded first draft pick) = = .005 = .015
Question 6. 250 4-number configurations are assigned to the team with the worst record; 157 4-number configurations are assigned to the team with the third-worst record. If the team with the third-worst record is awarded the first pick, then
P(team with the worst record wins second draft pick) =
