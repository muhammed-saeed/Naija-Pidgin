EDMONTON - A creepy manager at an Edmonton fast food restaurant who used a camera disguised as a pen to secretly film an employee changing has been placed under house arrest.

Atul Nagarkar, 29, was handed a six-month conditional sentence to be served in the community, followed by a year of probation, Thursday in provincial court after earlier pleading guilty to one count of voyeurism.

Judge Albert Chrumka rejected a defence pitch for a conditional discharge - made so Nagarkar could avoid being ordered deported - as &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; and said he was surprised the Crown had not asked for a jail term.

&quot;You invaded the personal dignity of this woman by taking photographs of her while she was changing her clothes,&quot; said Chrumka, calling it a &quot;horrendous&quot; crime.

Court heard Nagarkar and the 25-year-old victim, who cannot be identified under a court-ordered publication ban, were both working at a Kentucky Fried Chicken/Taco Bell restaurant where Nagarkar was manager.

The victim, a married college student, attended evening classes and would often use the small staff change room to change from her work uniform into regular clothes.

On Sept. 28 about 5 p.m. the woman was nearing the end of her shift and notified Nagarkar she was going to go change so she could leave in time for class.

However, before she could go into the change room, Nagarkar went there first while talking on his cellphone and exited the room about a minute later.

The woman then went into the room and began to undress. While changing, she observed what looked like a pen with a blinking light on the top to be sticking out of a hooded piece of clothing on a hanger.

She picked it up and saw it had a USB connector on the other end and took it with her after finishing changing.

She showed it to her husband, who had come to the restaurant to pick her up, and they realized it was a small camera device disguised as a pen.

After taking his wife to class, the man went home and connected the device to his computer. He then saw video of Nagarkar setting up the hidden camera pen followed by video of his wife changing.

He then discovered on the device that his wife had also been secretly videotaped changing twice before.

Meanwhile, Nagarkar had texted the woman after she left the restaurant, saying, &quot;That thing belongs to me please.&quot;

He also texted her three more times, asking if her husband was with her, begging forgiveness and saying he didn&apos;t know why he did it. He said he hadn&apos;t seen it, and was really sorry and would leave Edmonton if she wanted him to.

The victim went to police that night.

Nagarkar, who is from India and currently employed on a work visa, confessed.

In a victim impact statement, the woman wrote she was &quot;very disturbed&quot; and felt &quot;violated&quot; by what had happened and said she has cried about it on many nights.
