 Front-row seating for the new 520 
 
 The opponents litigate, WSDOT constructs 

A new condo owner in Lakeshore was heard to complain recently about the fact that almost as soon as he moved into his place a giant barge crane pulled up and moored itself right in the middle of what had previously been a pristine view of the Lake. He’s reported to have exclaimed to a neighbor,“Am I going to have to deal with this for years?” Probably so.

That barge crane, very evident to anyone driving towards the Lake on Madison Street, is part of the opening phase of what’s expected to be a three-year timetable for construction of the new SR-520 floating bridge.

That’s unless the opponents get their way, which is to stop the project at least until it can be designed to meet their objections. They go to court tomorrow morning, arguing that a less-invasive four-lane replacement highway across the Lake would be sufficient, given the bridge tolls currently in place. The federal court hearing in Seattle, which begins at 10:00 a.m., will deal with the legal issues raised in the various briefs submitted by the Coalition for a Sustainable 520  and the respondents, the Washington State Department of Transportation and the feds. Information about the hearing, including copies of the briefs, is available on the Coalition&apos;s website.

Meanwhile, WSDOT&apos;s contractors, Kiewit/General/Manson (a joint venture), continue to work away on the Lake, though delivery of the first new pontoons from Aberdeen has been delayed because cracks were discovered in the first batch. Although initial reports indicated that the problem had been fixed and WSDOT posted a video explaining the problem and the fix (available here ), that particular solution apparently didn&apos;t entirely do the job. New cracks occurred. A review panel is supposed to figure out what to do and report back to WSDOT by today.

Medina is where the first pontoons will be positioned later this summer (late July at the earliest), to the west of the area where the Eastside landings are now being prepared:

 
 Concrete for two of the 58 pontoon anchors has been poured and at least one gravity anchor installed. Gradually, the pontoons will advance toward our side of the lake, and the bridge will be constructed over them. We, of course, will have a front-row seat for all of this action.

 Say it&apos;s not so! Clown&apos;s unicycle goes missing 
 
According to a report we received this morning, it turns out that after Deano the Clown finished meeting and greeting some of his young fans at yesterday&apos;s Madison Park Days picnic, he discovered that his signature unicycle, which earlier had been &quot;borrowed&quot; by some kids, had not been returned. Later searches of the park turned up not a single unicycle.

 
If you have any information which could lead to the return of Deano&apos;s best means of transportation, please contact us and we&apos;ll be sure to let Deano know. at 7:12 AM No comments:

 Great day for a parade! 
 
 One fine leisurely stroll down Madison Street 

In what was probably a first for the Madison Park Days Children&apos;s Parade , the Seattle Police Department beat out the Seattle Fire Department for the honor of leading the procession yesterday. Engine 34, which usually arrives well before the parade begins and then sets the very slow and steady pace, was busy elsewhere when the parade was scheduled to begin at noon. At about 12:15, with antsy kids and their parents long ready to move, an SPD squad car pulled out and headed down the street--lights flashing and, occasionally, siren screaming--and the parade was off and---well, slow walking .

 
Some of the &quot;marchers&quot; really got into the spirit of the thing...

 
...while others showed, perhaps, a bit more skepticism:

 
Most seemed to be having a pretty good time, however, including those few who bothered to get costumed for the occasion:

 
Engine 34, by the way, did make its appearance near the end of the parade line, nicely washed and shined up for the festivities, which ended with the always-well-received Picnic in the Park.

 Summertime is crime time 
 
 More words for the wise 

Summer is the season when we generally remind our readers to be vigilant and lessen their chances of becoming the victim of criminals. The warmer weather usually leads to a spike in certain kinds of crime, yet every year around this time we start hearing stories of people doing things that in hindsight are downright foolhardy. Like leaving a ladder lying next to the house with an upstairs window open. Or working in the side yard with the front door ajar. Oversights such as these are less likely to occur if you take the time to think about the ways you and your property may be vulnerable.

A springtime rash of relatively petty burglaries and several car thefts got the attention of residents in our part of the neighborhood a couple of months ago. This spike in crime prompted Adele and Dan Clancy to contact the SPD and arrange for an evening meeting in their living room for neighbors to meet with some of the officers who patrol Madison Park.

Here are some worthwhile tips that came out of that session, as reported by the Clancys:


 If you are going away from your property, set up light timers to go off and on throughout the house at all hours during the night, not just between dusk and bedtime. If your car is on the street all the time, buy a steering wheel club, just to be safe. Never leave things in your car that might provoke interest and result in a break in. Never leave valuables overnight in the glove box or trunk. (An aside: Subarus are the cars most likely to be stolen right now.) A barking dog in your house is the Number One deterrent to a burglar. If you see someone suspicious in a vehicle, it’s ok to take a picture of the vehicle license plates, but do not attempt to photograph the individual. (Your phone could be later confiscated and used for evidence.) When you are home alone, never open the door for a stranger. Yell through the door (you do not need to be seen) announcing that“we”are all busy and don’t have time. Make it very clear you have another person in the house with you, even if you are alone. Always call the police when you have a concern or see something suspicious. Never assume another neighbor is going to make the call. If you call with a concern and it matches up with another, then it gets quick attention. Your calls keep the SPD attentive to our area and help keep our neighborhood safe. Be aware of elderly and shut-in neighbors and their families. Keep track of who is coming and going. (There was recently a serious case of elder abuse in Madison Park. Neighbors, in that case, believed that an elderly resident was being cared for by hired caregivers, though some people entering the man’s home were actually“stealing the house clean.”) 

 We’ve provided some additional crime fighting tips in past years, including the advice from the SPD that homeowners install video cameras to encourage criminals to take their break-in somewhere else. (Some pointers on being vigilant are available here .)

The Seattle Police Department is ready and willing to schedule other living-room conversations for those interested in learning more about how to fight crime. To encourage these meetings, the police provide the food, beverages, crime-fighting flyers--and themselves. The Clancys report that the meeting with the police at their house was very useful for those who attended. The contact for this area is Officer Sina Ebinger at SPD&apos;s East Precinct (941-8457). at 6:53 PM 1 comment: 
 This kitty is missing 
 
Maria left her home in Broadmoor on June 29 and has not been seen by her owner since. She is gray and white with white paws and underbelly. She was not wearing a collar but is micro-chipped. If you&apos;ve seen her, please let us know. at 6:00 PM No comments: Labels: Lost Animals

 More July happenings 
 
 Madison Park Days begins this week 

It&apos;s become an annual tradition in the neighborhood to follow up the Fourth of July holiday with a sidewalk sale, a Kid&apos;s Parade, and a picnic in the Park. Nine times out of ten, it seems, the weather for all of these events is better than weather on the Fourth , though apparently our bad memories of a couple of rainy Independence Day fireworks are improperly skewing our inexact weather statistics. On the other hand, we can&apos;t remember a single bad Madison Park Days parade! Sunny and fun for all---animals included!

The sidewalk sale begins on Thursday, July 5th, and extends through Saturday, July 7th. Saturday is also parade day, with the line up in front of the Wells Fargo branch at 11:45 a.m and the parade beginning promptly at noon. The leisurely stroll down Madison Street, a ten-minute affair, will be consummated with a food-and-drinks extravaganza at the Park, the whole thing sponsored by the Madison Park Business Association.

 
 MPC inaugurates Monday dinner parties 

Beginning on Monday, July 9,   Madison Park Conservatory   will be hosting a multi-course dinner each Monday night featuring a &quot;singular, coursed, prix fixe menu created around a guest Farmer, Winemaker, Boozehound and/or Chef,&quot; to quote from a recent  MPC  missive. Progressive seating will begin at 5:30 and end at 8:30, with only 50 guests accommodated, so reservations are recommended. Courses and prices will vary with the night, &quot;but four courses and $42 are good touchstones to remember.&quot; Details and menus will be available on MPC &apos;s website under Events, but here&apos;s the official rundown for the upcoming dinner on July 9:

 &quot;Stokesberry Sustainable vs. Local Roots:  Two of our favorite farm families join us on our maiden voyage. We adore and rely upon Jerry and Janelle Stokesberry to provide us with improbably great chickens, eggs and Icelandic lamb. Nobody produces more pristine Old-World and heirloom vegetables than Jason Salvo and Siri Erickson-Brown do at Local Roots . We&apos;ll bring the best of each to your plate.&quot;

 Cafe Parco offers wine tasting 

Those interested in something a bit stronger than what&apos;s being served at the Madison Park Days picnic on Saturday might want to make a detour to the courtyard of  Cafe Parco for some wine tasting.  Robert Ramsay Cellars and Airfield Estates will be featured, with sampling &quot;provided on the house&quot; from noon until 3 pm. Wines will be available for purchase by glass or bottle.

 [ Madison Park Conservatory is located at 1927 43rd Avenue E., Epiphany Church is located in the Madrona / Denny Blaine area at 38th Ave, between E. Howell&amp;E. Denny, and Cafe Parco is located at 1807 42nd Avenue E. Wine glass photo by  Sébastien Barillot on Flickr.com .] at 7:14 PM 1 comment:

 Real estate on the rise? 
 
 
The story of the local real estate market, in line with what’s happening nationally, is primarily about how low inventory levels and apparently increasing demand may be forcing prices upward. The Seattle Times , for example, recently touted the fact that home prices in King County are continuing to rise. Quoting May information from the Northwest Multiple Listing Service (MLS), the paper reported on its front page earlier this month that the median price of a single-family home in King County was up almost 5% year over year while Seattle’s median price had increased by over 10%.

West Seattle, Leschi, Mount Baker, Queen Anne and Magnolia were among the Seattle neighborhoods singled out as having had the biggest increases in median prices, but Madison Park was not mentioned. The MLS, however, does not break out sales information for this neighborhood, lumping Madison Park together with Capitol Hill, Madrona, Leschi and Montlake. So it’s not clear how the MLS information might have been mined by the Times to indicate that Leschi is hot right now. For the wider MLS region that includes both Madison Park and Leschi, the May data are actually a bit mixed. While the median price of homes rose from $394,500 to $447,500, a 13.4% increase, those numbers include condo sales. Just looking at single-family homes, as the Times did, the median price for our part of town actually fell from $635,000 in May 2011 to $562,500 in May 2012. That was the third-largest decline of any King County area tracked by the MLS.

Statistics have their limitations, of course. We’ve often noted that small changes in the composition of Madison Park sales can have a big month-over-month impact on the numbers. This is true, but to a lesser extent, for the MLS real estate region we are part of and for the year-over-year numbers as well. For the Capitol Hill/Madison Park/Montlake/Madrona/Leschi neighborhoods as a whole, listings were down almost 33% year over year, while sales were up 30%. This data may represent a good sign for the future, since increasing demand should impact median prices in the long run, assuming inventory does not ramp up even faster.

Hot on the heels of the Times ’coverage, the Wall Street Journal weighed in with a front-page story of its own last week. In it, Seattle’s real estate market was specifically called out. The article,“Housing Comeback Remains Uneven,”noted that a recent analysis of national real estate trends by Zillow concluded,“Homes in sought-after neighborhoods, including those near transportation corridors and with top-notch public schools, are finding buyers.” Other neighborhoods not so blessed, however, are“languishing.” A map of Seattle zip codes shows the 98112 area as being in the very top tier of Puget Sound communities, with a 5% January-through-April increase in home values.

According to Zillow’s chief economist, Stan Humphries, as quoted by the Journal , more than a third of Seattle’s zip codes showed increases during the period, a sharp increase from last year, when only 3% had rising values. Redfin’s chief executive Glenn Kelman, meanwhile, is quoted by the paper as saying that Seattle’s market is characterized by a“flight to quality.” While home prices are up in neighborhoods such as Capitol Hill, median prices are still on the decline in“Seattle’s far-flung exurbs and emerging urban communities,”says the paper. The article’s accompanying colored map shows a lot of red and pink throughout the Puget Sound region (marking areas of continuing decline) while bits of green (spotlighting areas with home-price increases) are centered primarily in the core of Seattle. Madison Park and our immediately surrounding neighborhoods are all some shade of green, with the exception only of the Laurelhust and University District area just north of the ship canal.

 
Whether there really is a flight to quality in Seattle should become more evident as the year progresses. Madison Park has apparently always bounced back very well from downturns in the past, and if good schools and close-in location are now the most important variables, this neighborhood and the surrounding communities should continue to stand in good stead. Anecdotally, local real estate agents report that there have recently been multiple-offer situations for several Madison Park properties, including for a couple of houses in the over-$1 million price range. It’s been a long time since we’ve heard of that kind of action.

Even so, it may be premature to accept at face value the subject line of a recent email we received from Redfin:“The Bottom? That Was So Last Year.” at 7:05 PM 1 comment: Labels: Real Estate

 Another neighborhood original comes down 
 
Since our posting last month on residential destruction and renewal in Madison Park, at least three more houses have been demolished to make room for new structures. This 800 sq. ft. house at 42nd Avenue E. and E. Lee Street, which bit the dust this morning, is just the latest casualty. Originally constructed in 1919, it purportedly was built as a beach cabin for the president of Frederick&amp;Nelson (a now-defunct department store). The house had apparently not benefited from any renovations since the early 1950&apos;s, so when the tall Portuguese Laurel hedge and large fir trees were recently removed from the property, it was a shock to many to discover that was an old house buried in there.

 
It took about four hours for the structure to be pulled down. Construction will soon begin on a high-end, energy efficient house, three times or more the size of the original structure. As one passerby commented upon seeing the destruction underway, &quot;Well, the neighborhood pattern continues...&quot;

 NW Sports Rehab enters the scene 
 
A new neighborhood chiropractic clinic with a special emphasis on rehabilitation, exercise, nutrition and soft-tissue work, will open its doors for business on Monday. NW Sports Rehab , which is an offshoot of an existing 16-year-old clinic based in Federal Way, held an open house on Saturday to introduce the staff and let neighbors see the new configuration of what for many years was Spa del Lago . The wall-length water feature remains, but the space has been updated and the treatment rooms expanded.

 
Dr. Jim Kurtz, who along with his wife, Dr. Ming Ming Su-Brown, owns the clinic, tells us that his experience convinced him that the general public could benefit from the same kind of comprehensive approach to combining chiropractic, physical therapy, and soft tissue work that is successful in treating professional athletes. He has an extensive background working with Olympic and college athletes, as well as with the Seattle Seahawks and Sounders and many other amateur and professional sports programs. &quot;I really believe that whether you are a housewife, or an office worker, or a competitive masters athlete, or a recreational golfer, old or young, you can learn to take an active role in your health and to do a little bit to make a difference in how you feel,&quot; he told us.

Kurtz notes that there are studies showing what minimum levels of strength, flexibility, endurance and balance are needed to achieve normal function in all areas on one&apos;s body. &quot;If you don&apos;t have that then you are going to have joint alignment issues, disc problems, tendinitis, knee pain, tennis elbow, chronic neck, and shoulder pain, etc. That&apos;s our philosophy in a nutshell.&quot;

 As if to show that the clinic&apos;s mission is much more than chiropractic services, NW Sports Rehab will be presenting a free class on detox, &quot;The Standard Process Purification Program,&quot; next month. Focusing on overcoming inflammation, fatigue, brain fog , digestive disorders, sleep issues, allergies and other associated ailments, the class will be taught by Dr. Katie Horton and will be held at the clinic on July 11 at 6:30 p.m. Those interested in attending should contact NWSR at (206) 328-5466. The clinic is located at 1929 43rd Avenue E.

 It must be summer 
 
As the first weekend of summer got underway on Saturday, it was not apparent from the weather that we had already passed through the summer solstice. But the dutiful arrival of this year&apos;s Madison Park Beach lifeguards was confirmation enough that summer was officially underway.

The lifeguards pulled out and tested the rowboats, strung up the swimming-lane markers, and then began that all-important annual ritual: removing months of accumulated goose poop from the lawn and beach.

 
Continuing through the first weekend of September, the lifeguards will be at the beach from noon until 7 p.m. on weekdays and from 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. on weekends. at 1:27 PM No comments: Labels: Madison Park Beach Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
