Restaurant Food Warning: How Many Calories Are You Really Eating?

02/08/2008 | CityNews.ca Staff
 
The food looks delicious. And there are so many things on the menu, you simply can&apos;t decide what to order. It doesn&apos;t matter whether you&apos;re in a fast food joint or a swanky upper class restaurant. The smell of the meals and the temptations to eat them are sometimes irresistible. Add a little wine and the conviviality of friends and you might not think much about what you&apos;re actually consuming.

But maybe you should.

A lot of what&apos;s served your way contains a monstrous amount of calories, things you might not necessarily ingest if you knew what it meant for your arteries, your heart - and your waist line.

 CityNews took a quick survey of some people-pleasing dishes at local haunts and this is what we found:

 The Keg 
Honey barbecue ribs: 2212 calories

 Montana&apos;s 
Beef nachos without sour cream: 2480 calories

 Milestones 
Shanghai noodle stir fry: 1500 calories

The numbers came as a surprise to registered dietician Jenn Sygo.

&quot;You&apos;d think that I wouldn&apos;t be shocked but I&apos;m actually very shocked,&quot; she said.

Most people interviewed on the streets said they would like to see the number of calories of each dish featured on the menu.

The Canadian Restaurant Association says, if you ask, some places including Milestone&apos;s actually do have nutritional value information available. But it&apos;s just not doable for all restaurant chains.

&quot;I think in terms of legislative menu labeling it isn&apos;t a workable solution,&quot; said Ron Reaman.

Dieticians suggest sticking to grilled or roast chicken, grilled fish and ask for sauces on the side 

Here are some resources you can use to check on what&apos;s really being served up at some of the more popular restaurant chains.
