 Fast Food Nation: What the All-American Meal is Doing to the World - Eric Schlosser 
 Fast Food Nation: What the All-American Meal is Doing to the World - Eric Schlosser

 Fast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser&apos;s disturbing and timely exploration of one of the world&apos;s most controversial industries, has become a massive bestseller in America and rightly deserves to be so this side of the pond. On any given day, one out of four Americans opts for a quick and cheap meal at a fast - food restaurant , without giving either its speed or its cheapness a second thought. Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems harmless. But the industry&apos;s drive for consolidation, homogenisation and speediness has radically transformed the West&apos;s diet, landscape, economy and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways.Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating expos with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. However, he rapidly moves behind the counter to the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world&apos;s largest flavour company) and &quot;what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns&quot;. Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--faeces in your meat. Schlosser&apos;s investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of regulation. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair&apos;s The Jungle, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting and unsanitary practices that introduced E.coli and other pathogens into restaurants , schools and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry &quot;both feeds and feeds off the young&quot;, insinuating itself into all aspects of children&apos;s lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. &quot;Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behaviour&quot;, he writes. Where to begin? Ask yourself, is the true cost of having it &quot;your way&quot; really worth it? --Lesley Reed

 An Absolute Gem of a Restaurant! 

 Advantages: price, selection, atmosphere, quality of food, service, family friendly
 Disadvantages: you might not know it existed!


...The Mint Restaurant - Essential Information

16 Academy Street 
Coatbridge
Lanarkshire
ML5 3AU

01236 441191
www.navantaverns.com

The Mint Restaurant is part of the Navan Tavern Group of restaurants. This group offers two restaurants in Glasgow, one in Motherwell (my home town) and The Mint. The Mint is located up a side street from the main shopping area of Coatbridge. Street parking is available. It is very easy to find if you know your way around Coatbridge. The exterior of the restaurant is homely and welcoming.

The Mint is a family run establishment and they claim to offer home cooked food in a stylish and relaxed environment. The restaurants has a function room upstairs which offers tribute evenings and meals. They also cover weddings and other events. The main restaurant is accessed via a ramp and the inside...

 McDonalds (not so) fast food 

 Advantages: Its convenient
 Disadvantages: Its slow, cold, unfulfilling and expensive.


...McDonalds is probably the best known fast food chain in the world, everybody recognises the&quot;golden arch&quot;trademark of McDonalds. 

A Little History: 
McDonalds is an American fast food chain which has spread across the world, and there are now over 31,000 locations worldwide. 
McDonalds was founded in 1940 in California by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald. Their first mascot was&quot;Speedy&quot;a small man in a chefs hat, but this was then replaced by Ronald McDonald in 1963. 

McDonalds first came to the UK in 1974, in South London. And had continued to grow across the UK since then, there are now around 1250 McDonalds in the UK!!! 

Now, McDonalds is like I said one of the most popular fast food restaurants in the world, but in recent years the stores have changed dramatically, reducing fat and salt in their meals, and putting...

   Harvester Restaurants 

 Advantages: Always one close by, quick turn out, children are welcome and catered for.
 Disadvantages: Toilets can be quite disturbing, not all dishes taste as good they are described.


...there is an over flow car park used by travel lodge customers next door. 

The entrance is usually through the bar. Just before the restaurant entrance is usually a waiting area; it&apos;s here that a waiter or waitress will show you to your table. You will be greeted by the obligatory&quot;have you been to a harvester before&quot;question as you walk to your seats and the&quot;help yourself to salad&quot;. 

The waitress will hand you over a large menu (these things are over 40 cms in length) and as you try to juggle it open without knocking over a strategically placed wine glass, she or he will take your drinks order before returning to take your food order. Depending on how busy the place is, you will be given around 10 minutes to choose but if you are not ready, just say so and she will return. 

The menus use a large and clear font size, they are...
