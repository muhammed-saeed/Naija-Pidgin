 Annual Old Louisville Yard Sale Extravaganza
 printable flier 
 
 August 2, 2008
 (first Saturday every August) 
 
 In 
 need of attic treasures, cellar stuff, appliances, furniture, bric-a-brac, 
 gifts, crafts, architectural details? Do you like to stroll along 
 magnificent avenues of Victorian mansions? Would you like to meet your 
 neighbors or just catch up? Would you like a great reason to visit the 
 magnificent setting of Old Louisville? If so, the first Saturday in August 
 is the day for you, mark your calendar 
 now! 

 In 
 Old Louisville we never do anything small scale. The Third Street 
 Association, the 1300 South Third Street Association, the 
 Toonerville Trolley Association, Second Street Association and the West 
 St. Catherine Association will be joined by other Old Louisville blocks 
 and associations for this year&apos;s annual extravaganza on Saturday, August 
 2nd. This will be the largest neighborhood yard sale of the year for the 
 City of Louisville.

 Directions : Find I-65 and Downtown Louisville and 
 take the St. Catherine St. Exit (just south of downtown). You will 
 already be at the northern limits of the sale on Floyd, Burnett, First, 
 Second Third or Fifth&amp;St Catherine Streets.

 

 For Yard 
 Sellers:
40 Tips for a 
 Successful Yard Sale 

    (1) 
 Put up advertisements on bulletin boards in your area (grocery stores, 
 community center, etc.) Try to put them up about 5 days ahead. After 
 the signs are up, drive past them and see if you can read them easily, 
 because if you cant, nobody else can either. Don&apos;t try to cram too many 
 words on the signs. All that&apos;s really needed on signs are words: yard 
 sale (or garage sale), the date of sale. And most importantly, after 
 your sale is over, TAKE YOUR SIGNS DOWN. That bears repeating, TAKE YOUR 
 SIGNS DOWN!  click here for a

  (2)An idea 
 for signs is to use paper grocery bags to draw your signs on then fill 
 the bottom with heavy rocks, stuff with newspaper and staple shut. Ta da! 
 - easy, portable signs that you can just place on the ground. Use 
 crayon or Permanent Markers to make your signs.  The lettering won&apos;t 
 run if it gets wet. 

  (3)Expect 
 early birds. Some sellers love them, others hate them. We will say No 
 Early Birds in the ad, but you will have some anyway. 

  (4)Months 
 before your yard sale, start accumulating the items you want to sell. 
 Put all the items in a box in some out-of-the-way place. If you dont 
 have to retrieve an item out of the box before the sale, it&apos;s probably 
 safe to assume you dont need it. If you still have the original boxes 
 and instruction manuals for an item, you can probably charge a little 
 bit more for it. Remember, one person&apos;s trash is another person&apos;s 
 treasure. Even if you think Aunt Edna&apos;s crocheted orange toilet seat 
 cover deserves to go in the trash, it may be the first thing that sells! 

  (5)If you 
 are setting up your yard sale in your yard (rather than driveway or 
 garage), make sure grass has been cut recently (but not too recently - 
 you don&apos;t want big wet clumps of grass sticking to people&apos;s shoes). Fill 
 in any ruts in the ground. You don&apos;t want people to trip. 

  (6)If you 
 are setting up your yard sale in your yard (rather than driveway or 
 garage), make sure grass has been cut recently (but not too recently - 
 you don&apos;t want big wet clumps of grass sticking to people&apos;s shoes). Fill 
 in any ruts in the ground. You don&apos;t want people to trip.

(7)Although you may have the friendliest dog in the world, it&apos;s best to 
 keep them away from your yard sale. Some people are afraid of dogs or 
 are allergic. 
 (8) For a 
 successful Yard Sale, Price everything! The price should be on top of an 
 item, not on the bottom. I know its a lot of work, but worth it because 
 you wont have people asking every two minutes,&quot;how much do you want 
 for this?&quot;As a general rule of thumb, price items about a third of what 
 they would cost new. There are exceptions (see next item). Clothes are 
 generally very poor sellers, unless its baby/kids clothes. But if you 
 price adult-sized clothes cheap enough, it will sell regardless. People 
 are reluctant to pay a lot of money for clothes they can&apos;t try on, but 
 will gamble if it&apos;s only $1 or so. I recommend taking some of your&quot;nicer&quot;clothes to consignment stores, rather than trying to sell them 
 at a yard sale. A rule on price: you can always go down on a price, but 
 you can never go back up. If you dont have time to price everything 
 individually, signs are helpful, such as&quot;all books .25 each&quot;or&quot;any 
 piece of clothes $1.00&quot;, or&quot;anything on this table .50&quot;. You also can 
 offer the customers a deal, example: paperbacks .25 each or 5 for $1.

(9)Another thing about pricing - I think the bigger the item, the bigger 
 the price tag should be. Make it obvious. If you&apos;re selling a sofa - you 
 can&apos;t expect the buyer to be looking all over for some tiny dot sticker. 
 Take a full sheet of paper and put the price and list any good selling 
 points or flaws:&quot;Sofa - $200 Firm - only 3 years old - comes with 2 
 coordinating pillows&quot;. When I wanted to sell a junky lawnmower at my 
 last yard sale, I took a 3&quot;x 5&quot;card and wrote:&quot;Lawnmower $5 - As is. 
 Has fuel leak but starts.&quot;It sold.

(10)When pricing items, keep in mind that&quot;a third of what it costs new&quot;is only a guideline. No one cares that you paid $75 for your advanced 
 quantum physics book 10 years ago. You&apos;ll be lucky to sell it at all. 
 Try to look at your stuff objectively. Do you really think people will 
 be knocking down your door to get at your old t-shirts with stains on 
 them? That&apos;s why they make good rags. If you have a bunch of items that 
 are missing pieces or broken, put it in your FREE box with a note&quot;broken - good for parts&quot;or something similar.

(11)Before your sale, look thru the boxes of everything you sell. I&apos;ve 
 often found old credit card receipts (complete with full numbers) in old 
 shoes boxes or in books as bookmarks.

(12)Use commonsense and don&apos;t prop up a nice framed picture against a 
 rocking chair on a very windy day. No, I didn&apos;t do it but I was at a 
 yard sale where the seller had a lot of glass shards to clean up!

(13)When selling clothes (and coats) take a minute and go thru the 
 pockets. I know a yard saler who once found a $20 bill in a jacket that 
 she paid $5 for!

(14)If you are displaying clothes on a clothes rack, I always use the 
 cheapy metal hangers. That way if the buyer wants to keep the hanger, 
 they can. I don&apos;t use nicer hangers because every time I&apos;ve used nicer 
 hangers, the buyer will say&quot;Oh, can&apos;t I just have the hanger?&quot;or&quot;Oh, 
 I thought the hanger was included&quot;.

(15)When selling books and CDs - arrange in a box so the titles can be 
 easily read by the customers. I go to many yard sales where books and 
 cds are a big jumbled mess - that gives me the impression that the 
 sellers don&apos;t care about their stuff and probably didn&apos;t take good care 
 of it when they had it in the first place.

(16)Put some effort into your sale and really try to sell stuff by 
 making it the most attractive it can be. If the first thing that someone 
 picks up is nasty and dirty, it may turn them off to looking at other 
 things you have to sell. If you are selling an old basketball, make sure 
 it is full of air. If you are selling a tv, have it turned on. If 
 something needs batteries to run, put batteries in it so it works - it 
 will help it sell. (But don&apos;t put in brand new batteries; use some 
 half-used batteries. I have a collection of used batteries for this 
 purpose - they aren&apos;t strong enough to power my digital camera anymore, 
 but still have enough juice to run kid&apos;s electronic toys etc). However, 
 don&apos;t go overboard in cleaning and spend 3 hours working on an item that 
 you only plan to price at $1. If all people see from the road is a tarp 
 with a mountain of clothes heaped on it, they&apos;ll likely drive by. Ask 
 friends/neighbors to loan you portable tables if necessary. Nothing 
 worse than going to a yard sale and just seeing boxes of dirty, 
 unorganized cobwebbed junk on the ground expecting people to fish 
 through it. Sometimes the sellers are just sitting there having their 
 coffee chatting with neighbors and ignoring the paying customers. These 
 people probably wonder why they never have successful yard sales.

(17)Yard sales are more relaxing if there is some background music on. 
 Have easy-listening middle-of-the-road type music on, not MegaDeath 
 Slaughterhouse. That allows customers to discuss potential purchases 
 privately with their shopping partners, without feeling like they have 
 to whisper.

(18)Display some of your more interesting items at the end of your 
 driveway to act as a magnet to lure people in (see next tip). Some 
 people will just drive by slowly and take a quick look to determine if 
 it looks worthwhile to stop. Some sellers prefer to be stationed at the 
 end of their merchandise, closest to the street. It prevents people from&quot;forgetting&quot;to pay for an item and they can also easily answer someone 
 who drives by and asks&quot;do you have any LP&apos;s?&quot;

(19)A tip from a reader: ever notice how hard a woman has to work to 
 convince a man to stop at a yard sale? To solve this, set out an old 
 lawn mower or power tools out front in plain view of the road, and 
 you&apos;ll get more business! It&apos;s also smart to set up a small table with 
 nothing but&quot;man-things&quot;(jars full of screws and nails, electronic 
 parts, tools and parts of tools, etc.). This gives the men something to 
 immerse themselves in while the women find all the real treasures.

(20)If you are planning your yard sale on the hot day, consider selling 
 sodas or having the kids run a lemonade stand. (Generally though, its 
 just easier to ice-down a bunch of sodas - bought on sale of course - in 
 a big cooler. And just sell the kind of soda you like, so you don&apos;t mind 
 if you have leftovers.) Selling lemonade can be tricky for a 5 year old 
 who doesn&apos;t understand a lot about hygiene - and will want to just grab 
 ice cubes with their hands. Someone told me they once saw a child 
 stirring a pitcher of lemonade with their ARM! On an especially hot day, 
 having a cooler of ice-water with paper cups (and trash can) available 
 for free is a nice touch. The longer people stay at your yard sale the 
 more likely they will buy something. Some people like to set up a coffee 
 pot and sell donuts - but I think it&apos;s too much work and could be a 
 potential safety problem - especially with the hot coffee, electrical 
 cord etc.

(21) Some sellers color code their items with a little stickers and 
 create a chart, example: all items will blue stickers are .50, items 
 with red stickers $1 and so on. Personally, as a shopper, I hate that! 
 Also, a buyer could easily&quot;swap&quot;stickers and you&apos;d probably not even 
 notice it.

(22) I&apos;ve been to so many yard sales where items are not marked. When 
 Ive asked the seller how much they want for a particular item, many 
 times they respond,&quot;I dont know, how about .50 or .25?&quot;No buyer in 
 their right mind will say,&quot;yeah, I want to pay the higher price.&quot;The 
 better way would be for the seller to answer,&quot;How about .50?&quot;Then if 
 the customer puts the item back, then say,&quot;or how about .25?&quot;

(23) You may get a customer who wants to&quot;help&quot;you buy totalling up 
 their purchases ahead of time and giving you the total. It may be a ploy 
 to sneak some high-dollar items into the pile or not paying the true 
 full amount. If this happens just say that you need to go through it 
 because some of the things are your sister&apos;s (or just lie and make up 
 someone) and you need to check what they are buying so you can divide 
 the money fairly with them.

(24) Here&apos;s a tip if you are trying to sell something that is fairly 
 high dollar and its a popular item that appears in catalogs or sale ads. 
 Cut out the ad with the item in it (with the price showing of course) 
 and tape it to your item. I&apos;ve seen this done mostly with gently used 
 children&apos;s toys and such. It shows the buyer that spending $10 for an 
 item that normally sells for $40 new is a good deal. Be selective if you 
 use this tactic, people will get turned off if you do it for every item 
 you&apos;re trying to sell.

(25) If you are trying to sell a bunch of old kitchen utensils, 
 rubber-band the knives up so people don&apos;t get cut.

(26) Make sure any items you dont want to sell are put away. If you 
 dont, that will be the one item the buyer wants. Sometimes you just 
 cant win though! At one of my yard sales, a customer was adamant about 
 wanting to buy a table which was not for sale (I was using the table to 
 display the junk). I had even placed a tablecloth over it. Then someone 
 else wanted to buy the tablecloth! So now I just have some plain sheets 
 I use as table coverings. Of course at a subsequent yardsale I WANTED to 
 sell the table but couldn&apos;t.

(27)During your sale, keep your sale tables attractive by filling in the 
 empty spots on your tables as things get sold. It&apos;s a good idea to keep 
 your eyes on your customers, but don&apos;t stare at them or hover inches 
 away. I get annoyed at yardsale sellers who are a little *too* 
 overbearing and has to tell me a story about every item I touch and what 
 a good deal it is.

(28)GUARD YOUR MONEY! Have lots of coins and small bills available to 
 make change. If you don&apos;t, your first customer will be a little old lady 
 trying to buy .50 worth of stuff with a $20 bill. Do not leave your 
 money laying around in a box. I recommend wearing a fanny pack or 
 carpenter&apos;s apron because you&apos;ll always have your money with you. If you 
 are running out of change, and someone is trying to haggle a price down, 
 be willing to negotiate if the buyer has the exact change.

(29)Don&apos;t accept checks unless you are willing to take the risk of 
 getting a bad check. A check that looks perfectly fine may be from a 
 closed bank account.

(30)Here&apos;s a tip about making change: if someone hands you a large bill, 
 leave the bill out in view until after you have given them their change. 
 Otherwise, a dishonest person could say afterwards&quot;I gave you a $20, 
 not a $10&quot;. And it would be your word against theirs. And make sure you 
 really take a second and look at the bill. At my last yard sale, I 
 glanced at the bill and thought it was a $20, and when I went to give 
 the customer their change, I looked again and realized it was a $10 
 bill, not $20.

(31)Have plastic grocery bags available to put sold items in. If selling 
 breakables, have newspaper available to wrap fragile items. Having a 
 calculator handy is helpful in totaling up purchases. Make it easy for 
 yourself to total items - price things evenly: .25, .50 and $1, NOT .40, 
 .75, $1.20. Heck, even doing that, its easy to mess things up (but 
 that&apos;s me, I hate math!). At my last sale, I had a 12 year old customer 
 correct me - I had given him back too much change!

(32)If you have kids, involve them by having them set up their own table 
 selling their old toys. Explain to them if they get rid of their old 
 outgrown toys, theyll make space to put the new toys that they buy 
 themselves with the money they earn. If they agree to parting with their 
 old toys, help them with the prices. At one yard sale, a little boy 
 wanted $1 for a cheapo little plastic dinosaur that would have been 
 overpriced if it had been priced at a nickel. Plan with them afterwards 
 to donate their good, unsold toys to charity so that needy children will 
 benefit.

(33)Your ability to sell certain items depends a lot on the timing (I 
 think it&apos;s better to have 5 smaller yard sales within a 10 year period, 
 rather than 1 big blowout yardsale once every 10 years.) At a recent 
 sale, a seller had an older style baby carrier that she was trying 
 (unsuccessfully) to sell. Although she had the original box and 
 paperwork, no one wanted a 10 year old baby seat. It&apos;s old enough just 
 to be&quot;old&quot;but not&quot;vintage/collectible&quot;. She would have done better 
 selling it right after she was done with it. Same thing with trendy or 
 current *hot* items. Remember back in the early 90&apos;s when kids were all 
 into collecting and trading bottle caps and pogs? Every once in a while, 
 I&apos;ll see them at a yard sale and now nobody wants them. They could have 
 been easily sold while the trend was still lukewarm.

(34)If you are selling electrical appliances, have an electrical outlet 
 handy or a long extension cord. (Put the cord away when not in use - you 
 don&apos;t want to create a tripping hazard). I dont allow strangers in my 
 house, either to try out appliances or try on clothes, etc. If they need 
 to use a restroom, give them directions to the nearest fast-food 
 restaurant.

(35)To avoid any hassles later on, post a sign that says&quot;All Sales 
 Final&quot;. I&apos;ve heard horror stories about customers returning the next day 
 wanting to get their money back on items.

(36)If you have a ton of kids clothes or small toys you are dying to 
 get rid of, consider having a&quot;fill a bag for a set price&quot;kind of deal. 
 Yard salers love getting a good deal. I went to one yard sale that had a&quot;fill a bag of clothes for $2&quot;and another one that had&quot;fill a lunch 
 bag of small toys&quot;for a nickel (very cheap!) If you do something like 
 this, just make sure you have enough bags handy.

(37)Another option is to sort the small toys and put them in sealed 
 clear plastic bags according to type of toy and whether it&apos;s for a boy 
 or girl. Then STAPLE the bags closed so customers can&apos;t open them. Then 
 have a set price for the entire bag. That way, you&apos;ll won&apos;t get stuck 
 with leftover&quot;less desirable&quot;toys when the sale is over.

(38)Expect that some buyers will expect you to bargain with them. If 
 it&apos;s early in the morning and you don&apos;t want to bargain, just say&quot;I 
 think it&apos;s worth that price. I may lower the price later in the day if 
 it doesn&apos;t sell.&quot;

(39)Don&apos;t assume everyone going to yard sales are fun and happy people. 
 Just like in the real world, shop-lifters and shady characters go to 
 yard sales too. My friend recently had some small items stolen at a yard 
 sale. Nothing too valuable, just a book tucked into a purse, so she 
 wasn&apos;t going to confront the person. But it could have been worse if she 
 had left other more expensive small items like jewelry unattended. I 
 dont want to scare you, I&apos;m just trying to inform you. These people are 
 few and far between so it shouldnt deter you from having a fun day 
 having your own yard sale.

(40)If possible, invite a neighbor or friend to join you in your yard 
 sale. The more stuff you have available to sell the better! And having a 
 lot of customers at a sale entices other people to stop too. Happy 
 Saling!

And don&apos;t forget, TAKE YOUR SIGNS DOWN! Thank you!
