 Incorporated: 1785

 Origin: Known as Wigwam Village, and then New Garden, this town bears the name of the Ossipee Indians. It was once the site of an Indian stockade fort, designed to protect the tribe from attacks by the Mohawks from the west. Early in 1725, the Indian stockade was destroyed, and then rebuilt by Captain John Lovewell of Dunstable. Later that year, Captain Lovewell led a small band of men to attack the Indians at Pequawket (now Fryeburg). Captain Lovewell did not survive the fight, but the battle was memorialized in &quot;The Ballad of Lovewell&apos;s Fight,&quot; and was the subject of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&apos;s first published poem, written at the age of 13.
