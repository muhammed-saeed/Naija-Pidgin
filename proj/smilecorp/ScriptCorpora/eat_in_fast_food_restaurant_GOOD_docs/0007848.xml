 I have been a waitress for two years now at a country club, where quite possibly the most grumpy and rude old folk come to dine. I have been disrespected in so many ways by customers, yet I have never resorted once to spitting or tainting their meals. It can be dangerous to their health, not to mention a huge violation of health standards.

I would just recommend being polite and respectful to your server and restaurant staff. As long as you don&apos;t create complex special orders (which aggrivate chefs and cooks, who are also in the position to mess with your plate), act obnoxious, or degrade your server, you should be fine.

 i do not know and would not be interested in how much people spit their siliva in something im about to shove down my throat. if you are interested in learning how often you eat peoples spittle then oyu should ask someone who works at one of the&apos;fast food places, resturaunts, or posicle stands *giggle**giggle*&apos;and ask them about themselves and their coworkers, and how much they spit in your ****! ~good luck=]

 It&apos;s a felony to spit in a person&apos;s food.
So I won&apos;t admit to ever having done it, but I can say if I&apos;m making your food and you&apos;re my best friend&apos;s ex calling in an order, the thought of eating the food you&apos;ll get makes me want to vomit. Even if I would be getting paid a million to eat it.

 Dude, end the stereotype. The fact is, it&apos;s illegal to spit in someone&apos;s food. Why would someone want to risk jailtime just so they could get back at someone that cheesed them off a little?
