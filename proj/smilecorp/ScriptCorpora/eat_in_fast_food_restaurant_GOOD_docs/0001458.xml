 Management Accounting Information for Activity and Process Decisions 
 







 QUESTIONS
 




 5-1 In evaluating the different alternatives from which managers can choose, it is better to focus only on the relevant costs that differ across different alternatives because it does not divert the managers attention with irrelevant facts. If some costs remain the same regardless of what alternative is chosen, then those costs are not useful for the managers decisions, as they are not affected by the decision. Therefore, it is better to omit them from the cost analysis used to support the decision.
 




 5-2 No, sunk costs are not relevant costs. Sunk costs are the costs of resources that have already been committed and, regardless of what decision is made by the managers, these costs cannot be avoided. Therefore, they are irrelevant for the decision.
 




 5-3 The general principal is that sunk costs are not relevant costs. But, some managers may consider sunk costs to be relevant because they may be concerned about how others will perceive their original decision to incur these costs, and may want to cover up their initial poor judgment.
 

 
 

 Both direct labor (DL) and material (DM) costs can be either relevant or irrelevant depending on the decision context and the alternatives that are available to the managers. When considering the purchase of automated equipment that will decrease the defect rate, both DL and DM are, in general, relevant costs because these costs are likely to decrease if the new machine is purchased. However, DM can be a sunk cost in the short-run if the materials usable only with the old machine have been already purchased or purchase commitments have been made. Similarly, if labor has been contracted for a specified period and the company cannot eliminate the extra labor when the automated equipment is purchased, then the DL cost also will be irrelevant in the short-run.
 

 No, fixed cost are not always irrelevant. For example, in comparing the status quo and a proposal to substantially increase the quantity of goods or services provided, additional fixed costs (that is, costs not proportional to volume) may be incurred to provide the increased quantity.
 




 5-6 In the context of a make or buy decision, product sustaining costs such as production engineering staff salaries are relevant if these costs can be eliminated by assigning the staff to other tasks, or by laying off the engineers not required when a part is outsourced. If it is possible to find an alternative use for the facilities made available because of the elimination of a product or a component, the facility-sustaining (business-sustaining) costs also are relevant.
 




 5-7 Cash flows at different points in time cannot be compared directly because of the time value of money that requires interest to be paid on bank deposits and on borrowings from financial institutions.
 




 5-8 Yes, avoidable costs are relevant because they can be eliminated when a part, a product, a product line or a business segment is discontinued.
 




 5-9 Two examples of costs that are not relevant in the short-run, but are relevant in the long-run:
 

 
 

 1. Costs of production engineering, if the number of engineers cannot be changed in the short-run.
 

 2. Facility rental costs, if the lease commits the firm for the short-run. These costs can be avoided in the long-run.
 




 5-10 Facility-sustaining (business-sustaining) costs are often not relevant for make-or-buy decisions because the costs are incurred regardless of whether the company makes or buys the products. However, if the freed-up facility can be used for another purpose, or its lease agreement can be terminated, then these costs become relevant.
 




 5-11 There are several qualitative considerations that must be evaluated in a make-or-buy decision. For example, one must question whether the outside supplier has quoted a lower price to obtain the order, and plans to increase the price. Also, the reliability of the supplier in meeting the required quality standards and in making deliveries on time is important.
 




 5-12 When a decision to outsource frees up space to produce an alternative product, then the contribution margin on the alternative product is a relevant opportunity cost in a make-or-buy decision.
 

 5-13 The throughput contribution is the difference between revenues and direct materials for the quantity of product sold. Investments equal the materials costs contained in raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods inventories. Operating costs are all other costs, except for direct materials costs, that are needed to obtain throughput contribution.
 




 5-14 In process layouts, all similar equipment and functions are grouped together. Process layouts typically occur in organizations in which production is done in small batches of unique products. In process layouts, products are moved and processed from one area to another until the product is completed. In contrast, in product layouts, equipment is organized to accommodate the production of a specific product. Product layouts are most effective for companies producing high-volume products. Typically, products move and are processed along an assembly line.
 




 5-15 Cellular manufacturing involves the organization of a plant into a number of cells. Within each cell, machines that are needed to manufacture a group of similar products are arranged close to one another. This organization reduces production cycle time, which is the time from receipt of raw materials from the supplier to delivery of the finished good.
 




 5-16 A JIT system is very different from a conventional manufacturing system. In a JIT system, a good or service is produced or delivered only when a customer requires it. JIT production requires a product layout with a continuous flow once production starts. Underlying the JIT system is a continuous improvement philosophy of eliminating or reducing delay, error, and waste, such as materials movement, storage, rework, and waiting time. In a typical JIT system, all types of inventories (raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods) are minimized. The ultimate measure of success with JIT occurs when the processing cycle efficiency ratio equals 1.
 

 
 

 Under many conventional manufacturing systems, goods are produced to a production schedule that may not be directly tied to when customers require the goods. All types of inventories are kept on hand just in case unforeseen events occur. Little attention is given to studying efficient and inefficient activities, and materials movement, storage, rework, and waiting time are part of the conventional work environment.
 




 Under many conventional manufacturing systems, goods are produced to a production schedule that may not be directly tied to when customers require the goods. Goods are produced in batches to reduce setting up, moving, and handling costs, but batch processing increases the inventory levels in the system. This is because at each processing station all items in the batch must wait while the designated employees process the entire batch before moving all parts in the batch to the next station. If the rate at which each processing area handles work is unbalancedbecause one area is slower or has stopped working due to problems with equipment, materials, or peoplework piles up at the slowest processing station, increasing the work-in-process inventory level at that station. Since supervisors evaluate many processing area managers on their ability to meet production quotas, processing station managers try to avoid the risk of having their facility idle. Many managers deliberately maintain large stocks of incoming work in process so that they can continue to work even if the processing area that feeds them is shut down. Similarly, to avoid idling the next processing station and suffering the resulting recriminations, managers may store finished work that they can forward to supply stations further down the line when their stations are shut down because of problems. Finally, i nventories may be kept on hand just in case inputs to various stages of the manufacturing process are defective.
 




 Because cellular manufacturing and just-in-time production reduce the production cycle time and focus on reducing waste by improving process and product quality, and quality improvement programs reduce the defect rate, work-in-process inventory is likely to decrease on the implementation of these programs.
 




 5-18 Reduction in time spent waiting for the next stage of production reduces both production cycle time and work-in-process inventory levels.
 




 5-19 The following three types of costs are incurred when implementing a cellular manufacturing layout:
 

 
 

 1. Costs of moving machines
 

 2. Costs of reinstallation of machines
 

 Costs of training the workers
 




 5-20 Financial benefits resulting from a shift to cellular manufacturing, just-in-time production, or continuous quality improvements may include the following:
 

 
 

 1. Increased sales because the short production cycle time enables a company to win customers by cutting the delivery time.
 

 2. Reduction in the number of workers needed to move materials from one area to another, due to close proximity of manufacturing processes and reduction in work-in-process inventory levels.
 

 3. Reduced material waste because of reduced damage caused by materials handling. Lower work-in-process inventory levels also reduce the potential for products to become obsolete.
 

 Reduced cost of storage because less space is used to store the reduced work-in-process inventory.
 

 Reduced clerical costs for keeping inventory records.
 

 Reduced financing costs of inventories
 




 5-21 Cost of nonconformance refers to the cost an organization incurs when the quality of products or services does not conform to quality standards..
 




 5-22 Waste, rework and net cost of scrap are examples of internal failure costs.
 




 5-23 Quality engineering, quality training, statistical process control and supplier certification are examples of prevention costs.
 




 5-24 Three examples of each of the following quality costs are:
 

 
 

 prevention costsquality training, supplier certification and statistical process control;
 

 (b) appraisal costsinspection and testing of incoming materials, process control monitoring and product quality audits;
 

 (c) internal failure costswaste downtime due to defectives, rework costs and scrap;
 

 (d) external failure costsproduct liability lawsuits, product recalls, and warranty claims.
 




 5-25 The additional cost of replacing a rejected unit that must be scrapped includes all the incremental material and conversion costs already incurred on such a unit that must be repeated. Furthermore, additional costs such as handling, storage, etc. corresponding to the material that is lost also are included. From a managerial perspective, opportunity cost may also be included if relevant.
 

 5-26 Rework costs in clued direct rework labor, any additional direct materials used, and if relevant, unit- and batch-related support. From a managerial perspective, opportunity cost may also be included if relevant.
 




 5-27 When evaluating the profit impact of an increase in the sales of a product, it is important to evaluate the contribution margins on the increase in sales for that product, and on the decrease in sales of other cannibalized products (other products that lose customers to the product being evaluated). In addition, if inventory and accounts receivable increase with sales, then the cost of carrying these additional current assets are also relevant.
 




 5-28 It appears to be good advice because it will avoid distracting attention and will simplify decisions made by managers by elim inating irrelevant details. However, it must be recognized that managers make a variety of nonroutine decisions, and the relevant costs for these decisions depend on the context and the alternatives available. Therefore, a single system reporting costs relevant for only one set of routine decisions may prove inadequate for supporting the full range of managerial decisions.

 (c) Additional quantitative considerations:
 

 1. Number of years before car is replaced (decision horizon).
 

 2. Expected resale values of both cars when they will be replaced.
 

 3. Cost of capital (interest rate) to consider the time value of money. (See Chapter 11.)
 

 Qualitative consideration:
 

 1. Subjective preference for driving an Impala rather than a Ford Escort.

 Gilmark should rework the lamps.
 




 5-31 (a) The original cost of $50,000, accumulated depreciation of $40,000, and annual operating costs (before overhaul) of $18,000 are all irrelevant when the choice is between overhauling the old machine and replacing it with a new machine. Note that the $18,000 operating costs are not sunk costs, yet they are irrelevant.
 

 
 

 (b) Relevant costs include the acquisition cost of the new machine, the cost of overhauling the old machine, current salvage of $4,000 for the old machine and the annual operating costs for both the new machine and the overhauled old machine.

 b $13,000 5 = $65,000 


 c $14,000 5 = $70,000
 

 
 

 It costs Ideal Company $36,000 more with the new grinding machine than overhauling the old one. Therefore, the plant manager should overhaul the old grinding machine. However, this analysis is incomplete as it ignores the time value of money, considered in Chapter 11.

 5-33 (a) Assumptions need to be made about the avoidability of the support costs if Kane outsources the component.
 

 
 

 If the unit-related, batch-related, and product-sustaining support costs are all avoidable, then Kane will certainly reduce costs by outsourcing the component. Facility costs may be unavoidable if the facility cannot be converted to alternative uses when the component is outsourced. However, even if the facility costs are unavoidable, Kane would reduce costs by outsourcing. In this case, the cost savings per unit if the component is outsourced would be:
 

 
 

Â 

 Purchase price $64.50 Avoidable costs ($73.10 $6.90) 66.20 Savings per unit $1.70 

 
 

 (c) Other factors relevant to the decision are the suppliers ability to live up to expected quality and delivery standards, and the likelihood of suppliers increasing prices of components in the near future.

 Joyce Printers should not replace the machines if they do not expect to use the new machines for more than four years. (See Chapter 11 for formal coverage of net present value analysis.)

 5-38 Prevention costs are incurred to ensure that companies produce products according to quality standards. Prevention costs include quality engineering, training of employees in methods designed to maintain quality, etc. Appraisal costs are related to inspecting products to make sure that they meet both internal and external customers requirements. Inspection of purchased parts and materials and process control monitoring are examples of appraisal costs. Internal failure cost occurs when the manufacturing process produces a defective component or product. The cost of downtime in production as a result of defects is an example of an internal failure cost. External failure costs are incurred when a customer in the field detects a problem with a product or the product fails. Examples of external failure costs include warranty costs, service calls, and product liability recalls.
 

 
 

 Of the four quality costing categories, an external failure cost is the most damaging to the organization. Customer satisfaction and future sales may be jeopardized. Moreover, product liability lawsuits can be extremely costly to the organization not only in dollars, but also in terms of corporate reputation. One key example of this is the Ford Pinto.
 




 5-40 A grocery store is organized using a process layoutsimilar foods are grouped together to make it easier for customers to find what they want. A grocery store might be reorganized into a modified cell layout. For example, someone wanting to prepare a certain meal, like lasagna, might find all the required ingredients in one place. However, this approach is likely to be costly and impractical and make stock rotation difficult.
 




 PROBLEMS
 




 5-41 (a) In determining the minimum prices, it is important to know which costs will change with each catering job. Assumptions will need to be made about how well the event-related and customer-related costs represent resource usage. (For example, one might assume practical capacity was used to determine the costs.) Event-related costs should correspond to each catering event, while customer-related costs should correspond to maintaining a relationship with the customer, not the number of events with the same customer. One might also assume the facility-sustaining costs are committed in the short run and will not change with the addition of one more catering job.
 

 
 

 (b) Other factors in setting the price may include the price competition Carmen faces, the likely demand from this customer for future catering events, and the current demand for Carmens Catering.
 

 
 

 (c)
 

Â 

 Menu 1 Menu 2 Direct materials and direct labor, 100 meals $1,300 $1,600 Event-related support 100 100 Customer-related support 22 22 Total $1,422 $1,722 Cost per meal $14.22 17.22 

 
 

 Assuming facility-sustaining costs are not avoidable in the short run, Carmens minimum price should cover at least the $14.22 for menu 1 and $17.22 for menu 2 from a short-run perspective. From a long-run perspective, Carmens Catering should charge a price that covers the costs above, as well as a portion of the facility-sustaining costs and a contribution toward profit.
 




Â 

 5-42 Incremental costs: Machine moving and reinstallation ($100,000) Incremental benefits: Increase in contribution margin $200,000 0.31 = 62,000 Savings in inventory carrying costs $200,000 0.25 0.15 = 7,500 Net benefit (loss) from a change in plant layout in year 1 $(30,500) 

 
 

 The proposed change in plant layout should not be implemented because its costs are greater than its benefits, if only one years benefits are considered. The methods in Chapter 11 should be used to evaluate the benefits over the entire useful life of the machine.

 (a) Based on the cost analysis above, Tanner Appliance Company should make part M4 in-house.
 

 
 

 (b) The costs (and cost savings) that differ between the two alternatives are relevant for this decision. That is, direct material, direct labor, unit-related support, differential batch-related support, differential product-sustaining support, and savings in rental costs are relevant for this decision.
 

 (c) In deciding whether to purchase part M4 from the outside supplier, Tanner should consider factors such as the suppliers reliability in maintaining quality and on-time delivery, and permanence of the offered price.
 




 5-44 (a) Acquisition cost and depreciation expense for the existing elevator system are irrelevant.
 

Â 

 (b) Relevant cost Existing System New System Acquisition cost $875,000 Salvage value of existing system at present (100,000) Operating costs for 6 years $900,000 48,000 Salvage value after 6 years (25,000) (100,000) $875,000 $723,000 




 The decision to replace the existing elevator system with the new one will require net present value analysis that considers the time value of money.
 




Â 

 5-45 (a) Selling price per unit $4.00 Variable cost per unit 3.30 Contribution margin per unit $0.70 Number of units 50,000 Increase in operating income $35,000 




 Genis Battery Company should accept the special order because it is operating under capacity and this order can generate $35,000 in additional operating income.
 

 
 

 Average unit costs can be misleading. The decision must be based on incremental costs.
 

 
 

 Other customers may also demand a reduced price. Therefore, their reaction to the reduced price for the special order must also be taken into account.
 




Â 

 5-46 (a) Net cost saving over 4 years with new machine Cash inflow: Salvage value difference $ 2,000 Decrease in annual operating costs (4 years $60,000) 240,000 Reduction in rework cost 10,000 a Cash outflow : Acquisition of new machine ($360,000 $100,000) (260,000) Net cash inflow (outflow): ($ 8,000) 

 
 

a 0.05 (100,000 4) $1 = $20,000
 

 0.025 (100,000 4) $1 = $10,000
 

 Reduction in rework $10,000
 

 
 

 Syd Young should not replace the old machine due to net cash outflow of ($8,000).
 

 
 

 The acquisition cost of the old machine is a sunk cost.
 




 (c) Other considerations:
 

 1. Will sales increase because of lower defects with the new machine
 

 2. What is the cost of capital used to discount future cash flows? In this case, discounting will only make the new machine appear worse.
 




 5-47 Both the theory of constraints and activity-based costing support aspects of process improvement and improved profitability, but differ in many other respects. The theory of constraints emphasizes the short-run optimization of throughput contribution, and downplays operating costs (except direct materials) because they are viewed as difficult to alter in the short-run. Consequently, analyses of activities and cost drivers are not conducted as they are in activity-based costing. Proponents of activity-based costing take a long-term perspective in which managers can alter capacity resources. Therefore, it is viewed as beneficial to produce accurate cost information by tying actual resources consumed to cost objects, such as products, services, channels, and customers. The theory of constraints and activity-based costing might conceivably be used together.
 




 5-48 (a) PCE in minutes under the traditional system equals [120/(120 + 80 + 240 + 40)] = [120/480] = 0.25. PCE under the JIT system equals [75/(75 + 20 + 60 + 5)] = [75/160] = 0.47.
 

 
 

 (b) Based on the calculations above, Walker Brothers should implement the JIT system since the processing cycle efficiency is almost double that of the traditional system (0.47 vs. 0.25).
 




 5-49 Cellular manufacturing refers to the organization of the plant into a number of cells so that within each cell, all machines required to manufacture a group of similar products are arranged in close proximity to each other. The shape of a cell is often a U shape, which allows workers convenient accessibility to required parts. The machines in a cell manufacturing layout are usually flexible and can be adjusted easily, or even automatically, to make the different products. Often the number of employees needed to produce a product can be reduced due to the new work design. The U shape also provides better visual control because employees can observe more directly what their co-workers are doing. Cellular manufacturing layouts reduce costs and quality problems associated with conventional manufacturing and facilities layouts. Usually production cycle time is improved with a cellular manufacturing approach.
 




 A just-in-time manufacturing system requires making a good or service only when the customer, internal or external, requires it. It is most appropriately used in repetitive manufacturing for products such as automobiles or electronic components. Just-in-time production requires a product layout with a continuous flow (no delays) once production starts. This means that there must be a substantial reduction in setup costs in order to eliminate the need to produce in batches, therefore, processing systems must be reliable. A just-in-time production system is based on the elimination of all nonvalue-added activities such as materials movement, storage, rework, and waiting times in order to reduce cost and time. It is an approach to continuous improvement and requires employee empowerment and involvement to eliminate the need to perform nonvalue-added activities. Just-in-time production encompasses all facets of making the good or service, including developing the design, acquiring the factors of production, making the good or service, delivering it to the customer, and following up after the delivery. Critical performance indicators in just-in-time systems include inventory levels, which should be as low as possible; the number of failures, whether these are material, people, or machine failures, with a goal of zero; moving with a goal of zero; and the amount of storing activities with a goal of zero. The ultimate measure of success with JIT occurs when the manufacturing cycle efficiency ratio equals 1 that is, when processing time equals total production time.
 

 
 

 The cellular manufacturing approach is not inconsistent with the philosophy of JIT as cellular manufacturing also focuses on continuous improvement. In fact, some JIT systems use manufacturing cells to make specific components as part of the finished product.

 Reduction in contribution margin $100,000 Cost savings: Utilities (9,000) Supervision (30,000) Maintenance (7,000) Administrative (30,000) Decrease in operating income $24,000 




 Therefore, JT484 should not be eliminated.
 

 
 

 (b) No, the decision to retain JT484 will only be reinforced by the sales managers comments.

 5-53 (a) Because the distinctive desserts are a source of competitive advantage, Beau should carefully consider the quality, freshness, and distinctiveness of the desserts from the outside providers, as well as the providers reliability in delivering the desserts. Beau will want to consider the possibility of price increases from an outside bakery. For the in-house option, Beau may have concerns about his ability to hire a suitable replacement pastry chef. If Beau hires a new pastry chef, the chef may be more responsive than the outside bakers to Beaus customers tastes. Also, there would be no concern about delivery to Beaus Bistro.
 

 (b) This question is designed to generate discussion about the trade-offs among the options. Although the second bid is lower-cost than the first, the first bid promises continual developments of gourmet desserts; the second bid promises only traditional desserts. In-house pastry production is the highest-cost option. The ultimate decision should take into account not only the costs of the different options, but also the issues in part (a) and the anticipated effect on demand and revenue (for pastry and for Beaus Bistro) under each option.
 




 5-54 (a) The costs and benefit shown below are relevant for the outsourcing decision. All but the $20,000 sale of office equipment are annual costs.

 (b) Hollenberry must consider the outside call centers reliability and quality of service in responding to Hollenberrys customers. Given Hollenberrys worldwide operations, the greater number of multilingual operators available at the outside call center could be an important feature. Finally, Hollenberry must factor in the prospect of laying off employees, many of whom have worked at Hollenberry for over 20 years.
 




 (c) I f the outside call center can meet Hollenberrys expectations for reliability and quality, including better service for international customers, financial considerations point toward Hollenberry outsourcing the call center function. However, although the outsourcing decision seems financially sound, there is great potential for decreasing the remaining employees morale because of the layoffs. This question is designed to generate discussion about trade-offs among the companys stakeholders, including employees. One alternative to firing Hollenberrys call center employees is reassigning the employees to other jobs and relying on attrition to eventually reduce employee costs to Hollenberrys desired leve l. However, this would increase the cost of the outsourcing option and reduce its financial benefits. 





 5-55 Before the rearrangement, PCE in minutes for Whisper Voice Systems equals [70/(70 + 45 + 55 + 30)] = 70/200 = 0.35. After the rearrangement, PCE in minutes equals [30/(30 + 10 + 20 + 15)] = 30/75 = 0.40. The percentage improvement in PCE after the rearrangement is [(0.4 0.35)/0.35] = .143 or 14.3%. Thus, the change exceeds Ray Browns requirement of a 12% improvement in PCE. 
 




 5-56 (a) The approach used at McDonalds in which customers wait in several lines is consistent with the push or conventional manufacturing approach. As one comes into McDonalds it is clear that they have been, and are building inventory in each of the specific bins that they use for, lets say, Big Macs, fish sandwiches, regular hamburgers, etc. Having inventory at predefined levels keeps the production process going. The motivation to use the traditional production method is to sustain a certain level of inventory to reduce the time the customer has to wait for an order. Notice in McDonalds that hot lights are used to keep the sandwiches warm. One goal of this approach is that customers perceive that they can get their sandwich very quickly due to the inventory of sandwiches always on hand. On the other hand, Wendys uses more of a pull or JIT system. As you enter into Wendys, notice that you cannot really observe any sandwich inventory building up. The idea in forming one line is that each person has the perception (and often the reality) that each sandwich is made on the spot. This procedure is designed to show customers how fresh the sandwiches are. The motivation to use a just-in-time approach is to improve the quality of the food and to reduce waste by eliminating the need to throw out food that has been sitting too long. As processing time and setup costs drop, the organization can move closer to just-in-time, reducing the waste and quality problems that arise with batch production.
 

 (b) From a customers perspective, it does depend on what one favors. If a customer goes to a fast food restaurant, his or her goal is to get food quickly. On any particular day, the customer may be in a great hurry and wish to run in and run out of a fast food establishment. Having multiple lines at a place like McDonalds may be very appealing as far as the perception of the speed with which one can get a meal (compared to a single line at Wendys). On another day, perhaps having a meal made freshly on the spot, without any warming time under hot lights is more appealing than the speed of getting the food. Of course, one may simply like the taste of one companys hamburgers over anothers.
 

 From managements perspective, apart from taste, competing in selling hamburgers may depend on other variables such as the speed with which an order is filled versus tailoring the production process to individual taste. The traditional push production process can lead to a lot more waste than the JIT system, because if a batch of hamburgers is made and demand drops, the quality of the food deteriorates and often has to be thrown out. However, if the line at Wendys is very long and customers begin to get impatient, the freshness of the food may begin to lose its appeal.
 




 5-57 (a) The article reports that customer service representatives are commonly evaluated on time to complete a call or whether they sell a new product to the customer. The article further states that companies should evaluate service representatives on the basis of how well they resolve the customers problem. For example, a company can track improvement in the number of problems that are resolved on the customers first call.
 

 
 

 (b) The cost of quality framework can be applied to customer service processes by considering the customers experience with the customer service representative as the product for which the company desires to satisfy customer expectations. The article mentions a number of activities that can be viewed as helping to prevent customer dissatisfaction with customer service. These activities include training customer service representatives in listening skills and knowledge of the companys products, arranging for representatives to hear a customer talk about positive and negative interactions with the call center, and encouraging representatives to share their challenges and successes. Making sure that the company treats representatives well can also be included among prevention activities.
 

 
 

 Appraisal issues arise in choosing measures to evaluate whether representatives are likely providing high quality service to customers. As stated in part (a), measuring the time to complete a call from a customer or the number of times a new product is sold are less likely to provide insight into the customers perception of customer service quality, and may induce representatives to focus on achieving a good score on the measure instead of resolving the customers problem. Measuring improvement in the number of problems resolved on the customers first call is much more likely to provide the desired insight and better aligns the representatives incentives with resolving the customers problem. The article further suggests evaluating customer-satisfaction ratings for each representative, not merely the average, because the average can mask important problems. Once a company identifies problems or needed areas of improvement, the company can arrange for appropriate training (a prevention activity).
 

 
 

 As in other contexts, attention should be given to prevention of poor quality, with the intent of reducing external failures, which in this context is a customer who is dissatisfied with the customer service experience. The low-quality experience may cause negative financial consequences for the company. For example, the customer may switch to a competitor company or may tell many other potential customers about the negative experience and thereby influence the customers to purchase the good or service from a competitor company.
 

 5-58 There really is no one correct way to allocate the $2,000,000 of quality costs to the four categories. Clearly, managers hope that they can minimize quality costs as much as possible. But, in this hypothetical example, we are assuming that managers, a priori , have much more discretion than they probably do.
 

 Probably the most desirable quality cost trend would be to load costs up at the prevention stage and to incur some costs during the appraisal stage. By increasing prevention costs, such as extensive training and quality engineering, and appraisal costs, such as maintenance of test equipment, process control monitoring and inspection of incoming materials, an organization can reduce other quality costs, especially those related to internal and external failure. As far as the allocation of the $2,000,000 goes, the correct trend is a high level of costs for prevention, followed next by lower costs for appraisal, internal failure and external failure.

 *Total sales were $100,000,000. 





 The most obvious problem at Renwal is the extremely high external-failure costs of almost 11%. Since as a norm many companies would like to keep their quality costs below 4% to 5% of sales, Renwal Companys quality costs are out of line. Note in particular that product-liability lawsuits, warranty claims, and product recalls are the biggest external-failure costs. Renwal must find out why its products seem to be failing in the field.
 




 Renwal should first turn to an analysis of its other quality costs. Quality costs are incurred throughout the total life cycle of a product. If Renwal does not control quality costs early in the research, development, and engineering stage by ensuring good product design, then design problems will lead to increased quality costs later on.
 

 
 

 At Renwal both prevention and appraisal costs are a relatively small percent of total quality costs (1.04% and 2.225% respectively). Renwal should consider putting more effort into quality training, quality engineering, and statistical process control. The company should also determine whether to spend more money on appraisal. There could be a problem with Renwals test equipment that would require the company to incur higher maintenance costs.
 

 
 

 With regard to internal-failure costs, Renwal also apparently incurs a great deal of rework costs. The product seems to require many additional costs that need not be incurred if the company could produce it correctly the first time. Perhaps the production process is at fault, or maybe Renwals workers are not well trained.
 

 
 

 Note that Renwals quality-related costs are very low at the prevention stage. They increase for the appraisal and internal-failure cost categories. The external failure costs are extremely high. This pattern of quality costs is what most organizations hope to avoid because the highest category of quality costs corresponds to poor quality recognized only after products are in customers hands.
 

 
 

 The more desirable quality-cost trend is the reverse of Renwals pattern. That is, organizations desire to have the greatest proportion of quality costs incurred in the prevention stage. By increasing quality training and quality engineering costs during this stage, a company can reduce other quality costs. With the companys products failing less frequently in the customers hands, customer satisfaction should increase and the companys reputation should improve.

 Since as a norm many companies would like to keep their quality costs below 4% to 5% of sales, Ideal Companys total quality costs are relatively high. The highest level of quality costs occur for internal failure (6.67%) and external failure (2.67%) compared to lower levels for prevention and appraisal (1.33% each). Therefore, management should investigate why internal failure costs are so high, especially for scrap and rework costs. Regarding external failure costs, the two highest are for product liability lawsuits and warranty claims. Nevertheless, these costs are relatively low as a percentage of sales. The company should investigate whether placing more emphasis on prevention and appraisal would decrease internal failure and external failure costs.

 (b) Strategic and other factors that need to be considered include:
 




 Reputation problems âCustomers finding the same bicycle at Premier Stores may perceive the quality of Diamondâs Bicycles to be low. On the other hand, if they find that the same quality bicycles are available at Premier Stores for lower prices, then sales of original Diamond bicycles and in general the price of quality bicycles will go down. Existing customer loyalty may go down.
 




 Long-term capacity implications The ideal capacity is tied up now with the low margin offer from Premier Stores. When demand goes up, future expansion is costly. This implies that the contract with Premier Stores needs to be finalized based on long-term growth of the market.
 




 Retail distributor problems The existing retail distributors are specialty bicycle stores. They will be annoyed when they find that Diamond sells the same bicycle at a much lower price to Premier Stores than what they are paying, and that this action enables Premier Stores to undercut the specialty stores. As a result, many of these stores may refuse to carry Diamonds bicycles, or decide not to promote and push Diamonds bicycles as much as before, resulting in substantial decreases in Diamonds sales through its existing retail distribution channels.
 




 Transportation cost Premier Stores requires Diamond to deliver the bikes to Premiers regional warehouse. Transportation costs should be factored into the analysis.
 




 5-62 (a) Costs in the following items are relevant to Polleys decision: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 13. Item 6 is not relevant because it is a sunk cost, and items 8, 11, and 12 are not relevant because the costs do not differ across the two options.
 

 
 

 Polley is likely to consider the decreased health risks for workers with the new solvent, decreased risks of violating OSHA regulations and incurring penalties, and decreased risks of negative media coverage. Polley is also likely to consider the potential increase in demand for Kwik Cleans services if the company markets its environmentally safer process. Polley may also try to assess whether individual customers are more sensitive to such marketing than are business customers.
 

 
 

 For operations with potential environmental pollution, prevention can involve efforts to ensure pollution does not occur. Prevention efforts might include changing processes, as Polley is considering. Appraisal efforts might include inspections to ensure pollution levels are within acceptable limits or workers are following prescribed procedures for dealing with pollution or hazardous wastes. Internal failures are failures (accidental spillages or leakages of hazardous wastes, or illegal levels of pollutants) that are detected and cleaned up or corrected before reaching the public. Finally, external failures are failures that are not detected, cleaned up, or corrected before reaching the public. As in the cost of quality framework for manufacturing operations, environmental pollution external failures are often the most costly to the firm. If prevention efforts are feasible, attention should be focused on prevention. Given that some pollution or hazardous wastes are generated, efforts should also be focused on appraisal, with the intent of minimizing internal failures and external failures.

 (b) Rossman should replace its old machine with the new machine because the penalty of $280,000 for early termination of the lease is more than offset by the net annual benefit of $301,000 for each of four years with the new machine.
 

 
 

 (c) A manager evaluated on the basis of net income may decide not to replace the existing machinery if there is considerable uncertainty about the projections for increased sales or reduced costs, given the relatively small benefit in the first year based on the stated projections. This benefit is $301,000 $280,000 = $21,000. Thus, a manager with a short-term focus may not lease the new machinery even though it would increase Rossmans income over the long-run.
 




 5-64 (a) The company may be monitoring time spent talking to customers, and if it is monitoring the content of the calls, the company may be evaluating how polite the CS representatives are.
 




 (b) The customer is likely thinking about measures or issues such as the following:
 

 Time from the first phone call to CS until the TV is repaired and returned
 

 Number of phone calls required
 

 Time per phone call
 

 Total time spent on phone calls
 

 Time between a phone call and the response from CS or WD authorizing repair
 

 Time spent writing to the company to report on the unpleasant experience trying to get the TV repaired
 

 Politeness of CS reps and supervisor
 

 Ability to resolve the problem with one phone call
 

 
 

 Instead of faxing or mailing the receipt, the customer can be allowed to email the receipt by other electronic means, such as using a scanner to produce an electronic copy or taking a digital photo. The company could also think about ways to eliminate the need for CS to forward the warranty authorization to another department, in order to increase the likelihood that the customers request can be handled with one phone call and less delay. For example, if a customer knows that the request is for warranty repair, he or she could be allowed to deal with WD directly instead of relaying the information back and forth between the customer, CS, and WD. The company could also develop a better system for determining which approved repair shops are the closest to the customers address.
 

 
 

 (d) RS3 can clearly learn from RS4s approach of diagnosing the problem shortly after the TV arrives in the shop. This allows the shop to order parts shortly after the TV enters the shop, with the result that the total time that the TV spends in the shop is likely to much shorter than in RS3. RS3s approach introduces unnecessary waiting time, a nonvalue-added activity from the customers perspective. In addition, RS3 needs space to store all the items waiting for diagnosis or parts. The customer faces additional waiting time because of RS3s inability to pick up TVs on a timely basis.

 (b) The response must specify what Woodpoint Furniture Manufacturings customers are likely to require. Presumably quality, cost, and service (in terms of product features and cycle time to fill order) will be important. The current production system should be evaluated based on its ability to allow the organization to meet whatever customer requirements are specified. If the specified items are quality, cost, and cycle time then each activity should be measured in terms of the time that it adds to the cycle time, the quality problems that it creates, and its cost. Possible specific measures include number of reworked pieces, number of defective pieces, number of missing pieces, and number of furniture items that fail inspection.
 




 5-66 (a) Customers will specify precisely the quantity and grade of steel (service) that they want. Because steel is both bulky and can deteriorate, it is very expensive to store. Therefore most customers are likely to want the steel at the precise time that they intend to use it (service). Because steel is used to make other products, users expect the steel to have the properties that the steelmaker claims it has (quality). Fierce international competition has made cost a key competitive factor (cost).
 




 There are many steps in this process where steel is moved and stored. Activity involving moving or storing steel does not add value. Activity that reheats or reforms the steel does not add value unless the activity simultaneously changes the chemistry of the steel in a way that the customer values. Remember, the customer does not care what process and intermediate forms that the steel took to reach its final form. The intermediate forms of the steel, like ingots, slabs, and blooms are required because of the process design, not because of customer requirements. Sometimes people make claims such as, You cannot cast sheet steel, you have to cast slabs and roll the slabs into sheet steel. Many steel companies believed this and built their facilities around this assumption. Some people always believed that the step of making slabs could be avoided and that steel sheet could be cast directly from the continuous slab caster. Today, it seems that we are very close to seeing that technology with its accompanying cost savings.
 




 In the short-run, technology is fixed. Therefore key performance indicators will focus on what people can control. This includes the use of labor (labor productivity ratios like employee hours per ton of steel, are widely used to assess performance in the steel industry), the use of raw materials (material yield ratios, like the weight of finished product to the weight of raw materials used, are also widely used in the steel industry, particularly to monitor the material yield loss as the steel is continuously reshaped into the final product), and the use of equipment (measures of output per shift from each of the major facilities such as the blast furnace, the basic oxygen furnace, and the hot strip mill are widely used).
 




 Quality, which means the ability of the process to produce the type of steel that it intended to make, is also very closely monitored. Steel that does not meet standards and cannot be sold as a downgrade product must be scrapped and reprocessed. Therefore, percent of original (before reworking or regrading) production that meets standard would be an important measure. Administrative people also carefully track whether orders are delivered on time and if they are complete. Therefore, measures such as percentage of order delivered complete and on time would be useful. For most steel companies, the most important key performance measure has nothing to do with the customer. The issue is employee safety and a common measure is employee days lost due to injury.
 




 5-67 Precision Systems 


 This case study illustrates that quality cost information can play an important role in alerting top management about the importance of quality improvement in a nonmanufacturing department of a manufacturing firm. The case is based on the following article by S. S. Kalagnanam and E. M. Matsumura: Cost of Quality in an Order Entry Department, Journal of Cost Management, Fall 1995, pp. 6874.
 

 The required questions are designed to acquaint students with some of the terminology of cost of quality and some aspects of conducting a cost of quality study. Quality costs, defined as those that arise because poor quality may exist or does exist, have been classified into the following four categories:
 




 Prevention (prevention of poor quality, or quality assurance);
 

 Appraisal (inspection and testing);
 

 Internal failure (costs such as rework or scrappage for nonconforming products identified before delivery to customers);
 

 External failure (costs such as warranty expenses or freight charges for nonconforming products delivered to customers).
 




 This case focuses on prevention activities (see question (f)), as well as internal failure and external failure costs for the order entry department at Precision Systems, Inc. Internal and external failures are defined with respect to the order entry department.
 




 Suggested Solutions to Required Questions
 

 
 

 This question is designed to help students recognize how cost management systems can interface with quality improvement efforts. As the case states, in spite of PSIs commitment to quality improvement, the changes [in order entry] would not have been so vigorously pursued if cost information had not been presented. COQ information functioned as a catalyst to accelerate the improvement effort. This is because the cost figures captured the attention of top management. Other responses might include the following: (1) It made order entry aware of the dollar impact of its errors; (2) It provided a means of prioritizing quality improvement efforts.
 

 There are many possible flows. For example, a sales representative may contact order entry to request a quote for a system for a customer. Subsequently, the customer contacts order entry to place the order; and order entry then generates an order acknowledgement, which is sent to manufacturing, invoicing, and sales administration. Once the system has been shipped, an invoice is sent to the customer. Ultimately, collections will receive the invoice. Customer support will contact the customer to arrange installation and will be available to answer questions over the phone.
 

 
 

 A request for parts from a service representative or directly from a customer would be received by order entry, which would generate an order acknowledgement that might then be routed to the stockroom, after which the part would be shipped and the customer would be billed. A request for service would result in an order acknowledgement being sent to the service department (see the following chart).

 *OA stands for order acknowledgement
 




 An initial step would be to interview employees in order entry, as well as its suppliers and internal customers. Based on the interviews, data collection forms can be developed. For internal failures, order entry staff would keep track of the problems they encounter while preparing quotes and processing orders. For external failures, internal customers of order entry would keep track of the errors they encounter when using information from the quotes or order acknowledgements (examples of forms appear at the end of this teaching note: Form #1 pertains to internal failures and Form #2 pertains to external failures).Suppliers to order entry, internal customers of order entry, and order entry staff should be involved in making improvements to the order entry process.
 

 
 

 Possible responses include the following:
 

 Office equipment and office space;
 

 Telephone (to clarify problems);
 

 Computer costs (making changes on the computer);
 

 Supplies (paper for printing new quotes or order acknowledgements);
 

 Lost interest and other costs associated from late payments by customers (due to invoicing mistakes resulting from order entry errors);
 

 Lost sales from new customers (due to delay in preparing quotes);
 

 Lost future sales from current dissatisfied customers (due to errors in order entry);
 

 Shipping costs on returns;
 

 Rework costs;
 

 Frustration and lower morale, possibly leading to poorer quality or high turnover;
 

 Costs related to duplication in manufacturing;
 

 Crisis management costs (express shipping);
 

 Lost revenues if underpricing;
 

 Scrappage of returns.
 

 
 

 Students can brainstorm about possible improvements during a class discussion. Possible responses follow.
 




 Incremental Improvements
 




 Empower employees.
 

 Allow sales representatives to correct errors without approval.
 

 Urge order entry to improve communication with manufacturing and other departments.
 

 Provide feedback to order entry on types of errors, numbers of errors, and cost impact. Daily feedback (suggestions for improvement) can be provided via computer.
 

 Educate sales representatives about effects of errors and about the process.
 

 Provide better training for sales representatives.
 

 Train sales representatives to develop accurate quotes and take on the order entry function.
 

 Have sales representatives take responsibility for the process.
 

 Track customer purchases to improve service to customers.
 

 Survey customers about problems; use the responses to prioritize problems.
 

 Stop the double entry of information.
 

 Get input from order entry on development of forms.
 

 Implement checking in order entry to help prevent order acknowledgement errors.
 

 Develop a reward system that motivates error-free performance of sales representatives and order entry.
 

 Benchmark.
 




 Breakthrough Improvements
 




 Develop a computer system to decrease the number of times data are entered.
 

 Develop a spreadsheet or computer program to check for inconsistencies between P.O. and quotes. Check for duplication of orders.
 

 Check prices.
 

 Develop a computer system that allows sales representatives to prepare accurate quotes.
 

 Install a computer system linking order entry, manufacturing, invoicing, etc.
 

 Use cross-functional teams to manage large costs or different segments.
 

 Develop a system that allows parts customers to get their own quotes on-line.
 




 Incremental Improvements Made by PSI
 




 1. Key information for quotes is now obtained up-front by the sales representative; earlier, the sales representative faxed partial information to order entry and requested a quote. Order entry staff then spent a great deal of time obtaining missing information. With this change, the sales representative cannot request a quote until he or she has supplied key information to order entry staff. This could be considered a prevention activity.
 

 2. Customers are asked to include quotation numbers on their purchase orders. This allows PSI to match orders with quotes and avoid duplication in manufacturing. PSI prepares its manufacturing plan based on the quotes received because they have a reasonably good idea of which ones are likely to become firm orders.
 

 3. Proper tools are provided to the order entry staff:
 

 Procedure manuals.
 

 Guidelines for sales discounting. Previously, the order entry staff had to call sales to seek clarifications regarding discounts.
 

 Printed configuration guides that contain information in the format order entry requires. Previously, the formats did not always match.
 

 4. Order entry staff are now responsible for both quotes and orders. Previously, some staff were responsible only for quotes, and other staff were responsible only for orders. This change had an immediate impact, as the person who prepared a quote now had responsibility for processing the subsequent order.
 

 5. A regular feedback system is now in place. Each internal customer department provides feedback to order entry once every quarter.
 

 Benefits: Cycle time for preparing quotes was reduced by 60%, and cycle time for processing orders was reduced by 50%. Also, order entry staff experienced greater pride in their work.
 




 Breakthrough Improvement Efforts by PSI as of 1993
 




 Many of these improvements are prevention activities.
 

 1. PSI began working with a vendor to develop an on-line configuring program that would configure their standard systems (order entry staff would avoid keying-in part numbers).
 

 2. PSI planned to acquire a new, more integrated order entry system that can communicate with the configuring program and turn a quote into an order acknowledgement when the order comes in. The system will also be able to generate an invoice, thereby avoiding rekeying the information.
 

 3. PSI began working toward providing sales representatives with a laptop computer equipped with a built-in configuring program. It will allow them to prepare quotes in the field.
 

 The anticipated benefits include a reduction in errors caused by incorrect or duplicate part numbers and a reduction in cycle time for preparing quotes or processing orders and preparing invoices.
 




 Prioritizing Improvement Activities
 




 Three considerations in prioritizing improvement activities are the perceived seriousness of the problems, the benefits of improvements, and the costs of the improvements. In this case study, the breakthrough improvement projects involve higher costs than the incremental improvement efforts. To identify the most serious problems, a Pareto analysis can be performed.
 

 In PSIs case, correcting order acknowledgement errors became the highest priority because of its associated cost of 7% of the salary and fringe benefits budget (see Exhibit 5-21).
 




 Update: Improvement Efforts by PSI as of 1996
 




 The first incremental improvement, a stringent policy of sales representatives filling out quote forms correctly, was abandoned because the forms quickly became obsolete and the policy was unpopular with sales representatives. In addition, the policy slowed the quotation process.
 

 The initial vendors quote for the desired configuring program was judged unaffordable. After an 18-month search, however, PSI was able to purchase a new integrated information system (including materials resource planning and accounting) that included a configuring program. In the meantime, PSI developed an in-house configuring program that runs on the sales representatives laptop computers. As a consequence, problems with missing, incorrect, or changed part numbers have been greatly reduced. Information on part numbers originates in manufacturing and is maintained and kept current by the marketing department. A change from line-item pricing (listing each component part with its associated price) to bundling (listing the component parts but providing only a bottom-line price) reduced processing time because customers previously would call for verification if any one of the component prices on the invoice differed from what appeared on the quote.
 

 The current cycle typically runs as follows:
 

 Sales representative prepares a quote using laptop computer configuring program and e-mails it to order entry.
 

 Order entry reviews the quote and sends a quote packet to send to the customer (pricing on quote is reviewed by order entry supervisor).
 

 When the customers order is received by order entry, the order is entered into PSIs system config uring program; the order entry supervisor approves the order.
 

 The controller approves the order.
 

 The order acknowledgement is transmitted electronically to manufacturing.
 

 Manufacturing builds the product.
 

 The product is shipped.
 

 The invoice is generated the same day the product is shipped, with no further review.
 

 
 

 Nonfinancial indicators that might be useful in improving quality in the order entry department include:
 

 The frequency of the different types of errors.
 

 Time spent on correcting problems.
 

 
 

 Frequency of reporting is an important issue when implementing a COQ system. Options for frequency of tracking data and reporting include:
 

 Keep track of the information on a daily basis but report monthly. Continue doing this until improvements are made and the information is no longer needed. The assumption is that continuous improvement projects will be undertaken to rectify the situation.
 

 
 

 
 




 Collect sample data for a specified period once every quarter or six-month period, for example, and assess the changes in the magnitude of problems. The assumption is that results from the sample data will be used to make process improvements.
 

 
 

 COQ information is useful for the following reasons:
 

 COQ quantifies the financial impact of the errors/problems, thereby providing a universally understood method of assessing the seriousness of the situation. As emphasized in question (a), COQ figures can play an important role in alerting top management to the seriousness of quality problems overall or in a particular area.
 

 Quality cost systems cut across departmental boundaries, thereby providing a holistic measure of the benefits derived from improvement efforts.
 

 
 

 COQ information should be used in conjunction with nonfinancial indicators, as the latter provide the information actually required for making changes to the system.
