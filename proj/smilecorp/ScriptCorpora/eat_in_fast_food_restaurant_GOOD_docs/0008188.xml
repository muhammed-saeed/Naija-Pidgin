Over the past few months, Wendy&apos;s aficionados in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, Virginia Beach, Toronto and Columbus, Ohio, have had a glimpse into the future. In these five cities, the fast food company is testing four different prototypes for redesigned Wendy&apos;s restaurants throughout the world.

Two existing stores have been remodeled in each city to showcase two of the four prototypes. Construction on the first redesign, at one of the Columbus locations, began in July and took just six weeks. The final prototype restaurants opened at the end of November.

Wendy&apos;s is monitoring customer feedback at the 10 outposts to see how customers like the new looks. A modified version of one of the four will become the standard model for newly built and remodeled Wendy&apos;s restaurants by the end of 2012.

The new store designs are the latest and most high-profile in a series of recent changes at Wendy&apos;s. The fast food chain has introduced new french fries and new burgers to its menu over the past few months. Some business analysts predict that, with these changes, the brand could soon surpass Burger King to become the second-largest burger chain in the country by revenue.

Wendy&apos;s spokesman Denny Lynch said that the new design was not prompted by changes at Wendy&apos;s peers, although he admitted that focus groups were probably sending similar messages to all quick service chains, so some design overlap was inevitable. And indeed, McDonald&apos;s, Burger King and Subway have all toyed with sleek prototypes over the past few years -- most notably, an almost-beautiful new decor for McDonald&apos;s France . Moreover, it could be argued that every fast food chain is panting to catch up with Chipotle, which has turned its industrially influenced spartan scheme into an economical blockbuster at 1,100 outposts around the world.

The four Wendy&apos;s designs -- dubbed ultra-modern, urban, traditional and classic -- range widely in tone and look , but all share a few qualities. Wendy&apos;s classic red faux-tile roof is gone. Tile floors replace carpeting in the dining rooms. And the company responded to customers&apos; calls for more varied seating arrangements by adding lounge chairs and cocktail-style tables.

So far, consumers have been enthusiastic, said Lynch, although he added that novelty almost always wins smiles at first. &quot;If you went into the store right now, you&apos;d have a lot of nice things to say. But what about a month from now? Two months from now?&quot; said Lynch.
 
What really counts is that the design brings people back to the stores and enhances the customer experience in the long term. Lynch noted that early signs on these metrics have been positive. For instance, a larger proportion of customers has been eating in the dining room, rather than in their cars, at the new stores.

That&apos;s not to say that every single element of the prototypes, which are all designed by San Francisco architecture firm Tesser , has panned out. Lynch said that customers have complained about the excessive height of the stools at the cocktail-style tables and that few have noticed the window-mounted digital TVs that face the street. Both features are likely to be axed in the final design.

So when will the new design come to your local Wendy&apos;s? It depends.

&quot;Every Wendy&apos;s is on a schedule. Franchisees sign a 20-year contact, which says that every five years, you have to do a refresh; every seven years, you have to do so-and-so. That means that newer restaurants will not have to do anything in the short term. Older restaurants have a cycle that will dictate when the new renovations come into effect,&quot; Lynch explained. &quot;What you&apos;re seeing in the prototype pictures is a major renovation. There will be modifications of that in practice. So if you&apos;re due for a new carpet, we might have you install the new tiles instead.&quot;

 gesswho42 0 Fans 09:52 AM on 12/22/2011 I do not understand how an industry that it driven at least in a good portion by Children and their families can completely loose sight of this when designing these &quot;updated&quot; fast food stores. The new designs such as what Mc donalds is doing is almost completly unusable for families with small children. The tall tables and lounge type chairs are not at all appropriate for small children. Nor are the &quot;family&quot; tables with no booths and if there are booths they are tiny. Also, these stores have gotten rid of all any and all play areas that used to come as a given with these stores. This is a big reason the kids wanted to go to these places to eat! The ne designs have nothing to do kids in their design, decorations or function. I have stopped going to McD&apos;s due to the new designs and will also stop going to any resturants that redesign in this new style!! gesswho42: I do not understand how an industry that it driven http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/gesswho42/wendys-redesign-fast-food-restaurant_n_1159108_124697203.html History  | Permalink  | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Tracy R Gibson 54 Fans 07:37 PM on 12/24/2011 Why do children require a &quot;play area&quot;? Why can children not be taught that rather than running around and screaming during mealtime, they are expected to sit in a seat and eat, respecting all the people at their table as well as in the building? My children never used the &quot;play areas&quot; and their life did not end because of it. Instead, they learned respect; They learned that all things have a time and a place. When they wanted to climb on things, run around and play I took them to a park. I am fairly certain that the fastfood chains you boycott because they don&apos;t provide a play area will survive.

Why can children http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Tracy_R_Gibson/wendys-redesign-fast-food-restaurant_n_1159108_125156756.html History  | Permalink  | Share it gesswho42 0 Fans 12:18 AM on 12/27/2011 MY 3 kids are very well behaved and we are constantly stopped by people who are shocked at our kids manners. You are assuming that my kids do not have respect etc? Rarely do we use these areas but if they were behaved at meal, why is it wrong to allow them to play in an area away from customers and their tables? The reason for my comment on those places who offer the &quot;play areas&quot; is that they were the ones who put in the play place to entice families to come in and bring their childen. Families who take their kids there and SPEND MONEY at their store. Hence the happy meal....same principal. So now an establishment who always had these play areas and focused on the families have in a sense turned their backs on this and moved on the the yuppy (appearently your type) and/or overly adult type of decorum and set up. My point on all of this is you can&apos;t build an establishment appealling to a type of consumer (families) and then no longer remember those people and their needs when creating/revamping their store. Yes, I will boycott a store in which I have to worry about my 3 and 4 y/o falling off of a tall barchair while eating his meal! And you are wrong, my boycotting does make a difference. One idea DOES make a difference. Good luck to you and you angelic children. You must be proud! gesswho42: MY 3 kids are very well behaved and we are http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/gesswho42/wendys-redesign-fast-food-restaurant_n_1159108_125385236.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

 msland1419 4 Fans 08:10 PM on 12/21/2011 I don&apos;t see how Wendy&apos;s stays in business. Fries now suck, burgers are too small and everything they have is just too expensive when you can go to McDonald&apos;s or Burger King or even Hardee&apos;s. Wendy&apos;s better add more lots more variety to their menu not just calling their same old burger the &quot;W&quot; and go back to good fries AND lower their prices or they are history. msland1419: I don&apos;t see how Wendy&apos;s stays in business.
