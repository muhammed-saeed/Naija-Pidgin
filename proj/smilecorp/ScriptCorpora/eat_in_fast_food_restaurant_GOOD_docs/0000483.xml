Quirky, atmospheric restaurant. Manages to be different without being tacky. Great food and huge portions. I had the veggie burritos which were delicious and the next day tried the chilli cheese fries which were also great.The burgers also looked good. Prices were very reasonable. Also a good selection of beers, soft drinks and cocktails. The staff were friendly and spoke good English and the service was quick. The restaurant has different events every night we were there during the week one night there was a live DJ the other night was cinema evening. Definitely recommended for excellent food and something a bit different.

Great burgers and fries. Outrageous decor somewhere between Chinese restaurant and Irish pub. Loads of dancing (hey this is Germany, dancing is not a given), live music and the odd burlesque show. Good fun everytime, one place where everyone is sure to pull.
