Brain injury compensation for Oxford crash



A man from Oxford has been awarded£340,000 personal injury compensation after making a car accident claim for an October 2003 incident.

He had just finished working a shift at a fast food restaurant when he accepted the offer of a lift home in a friend&apos;s car. Unfortunately, despite making repeated requests for his friend to slow down, the speeding vehicle careered into a disused rail bridge.

As a result of the crash, the former fast food worker suffered serious personal injury and needed surgery to remove blood clots from his brain. He also needed reconstructive surgery to rebuild a shattered eye socket and cheekbone.

The car crash claim was made through the Motor Insurers Bureau, as the negligent driver did not possess any insurance.

The car crash claim awardee told press, &quot;It has been five years of hell.

&quot;My mum and dad have taken a lot of it with my temper.

&quot;First of all I wasn&apos;t allowed out on my own because I was on anti-epilepsy medicine and then there was the frustration because I can&apos;t hold down a proper job.

&quot;It was a life or death situation - now I don&apos;t let anything bother me.&quot;

The successful compensation action was mounted with the assistance of a no win, no fee solicitor.
