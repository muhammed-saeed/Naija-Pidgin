 EZ Lube 
 June 30, 2011 
 
My car needs oil change, the last one was done 3 months ago. I did the last one myself but I received a discount coupon from EZ Lube so I decided to try them.

The oil change was done quick and cheap. I was there at 2:00 PM and was done at 2:45 PM. It was not only done quickly but the staff are also very nice. While the oil change is done on the bay, a video camera let’s you watch as the oil change is done.I did not only get an oil change but also have my windows cleaned and the interior was vacummed. Other checks are also performed like fluid levels and the battery.

The staff made recommendations on things that need to be done, they just made recommendations though, no pressure.

I will definitely use them again.

 Water For Elephants 
 June 30, 2011 
 
I finally went to see this movie. I did not went to see it as soon as it came out as most review I read was not favorable. I disagree with the reviews.

The movie stars Reese Witherspoon as the lead circus performer and Robert Pattison as the circus veterinarian and Christoph Waltz as the circus owner. It is about a traveling circus  and set during the depression. As most business during the depression, a lot of circus companies go bankrupt. Their circus picks up whatever is left of these bankrupt circuses like talents and workers. But their circus company has its own financial problems until it acquired an elephant named Rosie.

The character played by Reese Witherspoon is married to the circus owner. The owner has psychological issues and mistreat the circus animals specially Rosie the elephant as well as the circus employers. He throws out of the train employees just so he won’t pay them. He doesn’t care if these employees survive being thrown out. The employees finally rebelled against the owner. They released the circus animals during a performance creating chaos and causing the company to go belly up.

The movie is shot beautifully. There are scenes that are so beautiful like a postcard and both Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison acted well. The story line is similar to the tragic opera Carmen. A middle-aged business owner marries a young beautiful woman in his employ. The young woman falls in love with a young guy and that’s when the problem starts. But unlike the opera, the husband gets killed instead of the young lovers.

If you are into romance movies, Water For Elephants is worth seeing.

 Jumping The Broom 
 June 30, 2011 
 
The movie is comedy starring Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. It is about two African-American families–one wealthy from Martha’s Vineyard, one working class from Brooklyn–join together for a wedding at Martha’s Vineyard where they produce a culture clash. The bride’s family is populated with French speaking divas while the groom’s family is typical middle class African-American.

The groom and the bride have been in a whirlwind romance for just 6 months and are going to be married. Both have not met their future in-laws and they are doing this at their wedding. The grooms family is coming from Brooklyn over to Martha’s Vineyard where the bride’s family which is full of divas have a estate likened to the Kennedy compound. One of the conflicts includes whether the bride and groom are going to jump the broom at their ceremony. Jumping the broom is a tradition practiced by the groom’s family. The bride and mom have other plans but in the end the bride relented to jumping the broom.

On the acting side, the movie is stolen by Loretta Devine as the groom’s cranky matriarch undergoing anger management courses. Angela Bassett as the bride’s mother did a very good acting job. Even the supporting characters did a very good acting job including Julie Bowen who played Amy as the Anglo event wedding planner. There are a dozen-plus major characters but each character maximized each scene. While there is nothing special visually in this movie, the people on-screen more than compensate, the cast completely sold it and the script gave them moments to work with. The flowers in the garden and vase all look so fake.

The movie has a lot in common with Tyler Perry’s movie“Why Did I Get Married”but more relaxed and with fewer melodramatic mood swings. In Perry’s movie a vacation gathering brings a litany of personal and family crises.

Most of the jokes are funny and mostly relating to African-American identity which the audience in the movie house I went to see. Although this movie is formulaic and not particularly inventive, it is still engaging. I laughed a lot and ultimately satisfied.

 Farmer Boys 
 June 30, 2011 
 
 

Farmer Boys is a fast food restaurant in California and Nevada but most of it’s outlet is found in the Inland Empire (San Bernardino and Riverside county) region of Southern California. I went to their Irwindale California location to try them.

DECOR:The decor motif is country with whimsical decor pieces. Furniture is mostly oak.

FOOD: They have breakfast plates and breakfast on the run which are served all day, hamburgers, sandwiches, salads&amp;wraps, and sides. They have fish plates, soup&amp;chili bowls, flamed broiled chicken sandwiches, shakes and fountain drinks and desserts. The sides are onion rings, chili cheese fries and crispy zucchini.

For comparison with other fast food restaurants, I tried the Farmer’s Burger. It has 1/2 lb of flamed-broiled burger patty topped with double cheese, hickory smoked bacon and fresh avocado and greens. The burger tasted good and not greasy like other hamburgers. The greens are fresh and crispy and the flamed-broiled burger patty makes them stand-up above the crowd.

For the side, I ordered the crispy zucchini which is heavenly. It is a battered wedges of zucchini and deep fried.  I ordered the real strawberry shake. The shake needs more strawberry otherwise it is passable.

CLEANLINESS: The Irwindale outlet have a letter grade of“A”from the state of California. Their men’s restroom has paper towels soap and warm water although the restroom may need some extra scrubbing. The tile grouts are dark.

STAFF: The staff are friendly and quick. Orders are taken at the counter and your food is delivered to your table. I had my food after about ten minutes.

Overall, this fast food restaurant is worth going back to. Food is fresh and tasty with a lot of selection, and staff are friendly.

Next time, I will try their breakfast items and maybe their soups. They claim each egg is cracked by hand to make their farm fresh 3-Egg Breakfasts and Omelets. I will also try their onion rings. They claim it requires 21 steps to achieve their great onion rings which includes hand cutting the onions, hand dipping in batter with 2 different kinds of batter.

 Lola’s Peruvian Restaurant 
 June 30, 2011 
 
 

I have been going to this Peruvian restaurant in Glendale for years when they were still a hole on the wall. They have renovated the place before my last visit. It is a sit down restaurant featuring Peruvian food.

ADDRESS: 230 North Brand Boulevard, Glendale, CA 91203

DECOR: Modern contemporary with dark colors (black, brown, chocolate, tan). The ceiling and some walls are painted black and tan. The table linens are black, chairs are stained in mahogany color. Staff wear black outfits. Inca inspired black and white posters and art pieces hang on the wall. Pipe-in music is a little bit loud. Patio/sidewalk sitting is available.

FOOD: The food is authentic Peruvian with beef, chicken, fish, corn, pasta, potatoes, rice and yam. I went there for dinner and ordered the Lomo al Vino. It is simmered beef with fried potatoes, green and red bell peppers, tomatoes and onions. It came with a cup of rice. The beef is tender and flavorful and I enjoyed it although the serving portion is on the low side. Being Asian, they could have added another cup of rice. The beef is simmered to perfection.

Their wine selection is extensive but I opted for the fountain drink.

SERVICE: The service is good. Before they renovated, service is very slow but not now. We were sitted as soon as we walk in. The server got what we wanted to drink and back in a few minutes with the drinks and bread. The bread came with green sauce which is a bit spicy but yummy. Took our orders without writing them (and she got them right) and our food was served after twenty minutes.

CLEANLINESS: The letter grade from the state is“A”. Their men’s room is clean, with hand soap, paper towels and warm water.

Overall, Lola’s Authentic Peruvian Restaurant is worth going back to. It is an alternative to the chain restaurants along Brand Boulevard in downtown Glendale. Their food and service are awesome.

Next time, I will try their fish ceviche and authentic Peruvian drinks. I might also try their version of rotisserie chicken. I highly recommend Lola’s for Peruvian food.

 Pep Boys Auto Shop 
 June 30, 2011 
 
My car is making a loud noise every time I start it. I made an appointment with Pep Boys at Foothill and Hellman in Rancho Cucamonga. Since it is already late, I choose Pep Boys as they close later than most car repair shops, 9:00 PM.

When I arrived at the shop I was immediately taken cared of. They looked at my car and recommended that several belts need to be replaced. They replaced the belts and I was on my way.

Approximately six weeks later, the problem with the noise when starting the car came back. I went back to Pep Boys 2 weeks after the noise came back. They adjusted the belts they replaced and the noise went away.

A week later the noise came back. Another shop where I got an oil change recommended that I go back to Pep Boys for more adjustments. I went back but was told I need to came back the next day as they don’t have enough staff to look at my car. I went the next day and was told to wait for 4 hours and that it is possible the problem is not the belts they replaced that is making the noise. I did not wait and instead went to another shop and have the belts adjusted.

I will never go back to Pep Boys.

 Smart&amp; Final 
 June 30, 2011 
 
 

Smart&amp;Final is a chain of warehouse-style food and supply stores similar to Costco and Sam’s Club. They are based in California and their stores are in the Southwestern United States. They have much smaller stores compared to Costco and Sam’s Club and membership is not required in order to shop.

They sell basic grocery items and items for restaurants, janitorial supplies, and party supplies. They sell regular grocery brands and their own private label. They have beverages, candies, cooking equipments and supplies for restaurants, frozen foods (fruits, cakes, ice cream, breakfast foods, Mexican foods, vegetables, meat, seafood and poultry), baking supplies, janitorial items (soap, mops, brooms). They also have fresh refrigerated meat in large and small cuts. They may have the cheapest price for meat products. Produce is in abundant supply and selection; conventional and organic and they look fresh.

I have been to Smart&amp;Final a few times and went to their store in Pasadena to make this review. They have very good service, the store is not crowded and when a line starts to form at check-out they opened a new counter. The prices are a comparable to other club stores but far cheaper than conventional grocery stores. They have basic staple items although there is not much selection for each items which is typical for club stores although I would say they have a little bit more selection on every item compared to Costco and Sam’s Club.

Unlike conventional grocery stores, they have limited store locations so you need to plan. It is great for party supplies and when you have a restaurant or small business or a big family to feed. It is not your everyday grocery store more like every 2-3 months store.

The particular store I went to is clean, organized and well lighted. Parking is abundant too.

Overall, Smart&amp;Final is an alternative to other club stores for prices but not for the number of selections for each item. You need to plan your trip if you want to shop at Smart&amp;Final. It is the store if you are planning a party, a big family to feed  and needs to buy in bulk.
