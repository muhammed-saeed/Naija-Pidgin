 Babies are consuming fast food in their car seats. Forty-four percent of LilSugar moms say that their tots tasted fast food by the time they were 1 . Despite the Food Revolution and expert advice , parents still pull up to drive thru windows to purchase meals for their families — despite the fact that the proteins aren&apos;t always the meat they appear to be . One report said :
 Kantha Shelke, chief science officer of Corvus Blue LLC, a Chicago food science and nutrition research firm, says it&apos;s frankly impossible for a consumer to know how much meat is in a food item at Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King or any other fast food restaurant. That&apos;s because such disclosure is not required. Even when an item is touted as being &quot;all-beef,&quot; it may be only 70 percent meat and not run afoul of regulations.
