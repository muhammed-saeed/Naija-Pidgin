The Sharp UP700 cash register lets you customize the arrangement of the keys any way you like to accommodate your specific business and application requirements. If you are upgrading from an older machine, you can arrange the new keyboard to be consistent with the old one, reducing both training time and errors. You can also switch between up to three PLU menus a convenient feature for restaurants that change their menus or prices depending on the time of day.
  
 
 
 The UP-700s built-in software enables on-the-fly easy price changes, tip with edit tip function, tray subtotal, waste function, multiple menu levels, multiple combo tables and multiple media menu keys, and even a standard credit card / debit card interface.
