Should fast food restaurants be allowed in schools?
 This is a topic for a essay I have to write. I don&apos;t think they should because of what our world is coming to. Kids are getting to much junk food already we don&apos;t need to add to it. They should get a healthy lunch at school.

 While I don&apos;t think that there should be fast food restaurants in schools, the unfortunate fact is that most school lunchrooms serve mostly foods that are at least as bad as any junk food that could be bought in a fast food restaurant.

Why is that? Because that&apos;s what kids want to eat, and telling kids that something else is better for them isn&apos;t going to change their eating habits, which they learned at home from their parents.

At home nowadays kids eat mostly fast food and junk food. They expect to eat this in school, too. God forbid that a school would not serve nachos and french fries every meal. The same parents who never cook real meals and expect the schools to educate their kids about nutrition would be up in arms about the schools infringing on their kids&apos;right to eat anything they pleased.

 Definitely agree.

Here&apos;s some arguments for your essay:
- If there is a fast food restaurant, kids will likely ask to go there rather than bring healthy (and boring) lunches from home
- It can be really expensive and not necessary
- Obesity with kids
- Depending on the age of the kids, having a fast food place in the school may make it seem&quot;acceptable&quot;to the kids so they may consider it part of a normal diet - which isn&apos;t healthy.
- Seriously, if I had to choose between a peanut butter jam sandwich and a baggie of carrots, or a cheese burger happy meal, then clearly I would go for the latter.
- The school has an ethical responsibility to ensure healthy options are available to students
- There is still controversy regarding relationships between state funded educational facilities and corporations. I would agree with the people who think that school should be for learning not for consumerism.

Good luck with your essay!! Totally agree with you. That&apos;s an exciting topic!

 Do you mean, should their foods be offered at schools instead of a regular school cafeteria?

You have a good start on your essay. I suggest you go to your local public library and ask for books on eating out in restaurants. There is a good one by the American Diabetes Association&quot;Guide to Healthy Restaurant Eating.&quot;This book has the calorie , fat, sodium content and more on some of the major foods offered in fast-food restaurants and in places like Applebees and Denny&apos;s.

If you can&apos;t make it the library, most places now list this stuff on their websites. You can pull up a few examples to support your arguments.

Many of these restaurants do offer&apos;healthier&apos;alternatives, but I am not sure a kid will take a salad over a burger when given the choice. Also, the lettuce used in the salads is often head lettuce which has little or no nutritional value.

Good luck.

 I&apos;ve seen a bunch of posters talk about having healthier choices at school. While I completely agree with that, how are they&quot;choices&quot;if they are the only things offered? I don&apos;t think there should be fast food at elementary or middle school levels, but they should be available at high school. You can&apos;t force kids this age to eat what you want them to; they have to learn to make their own choices...and what the consequences of those choices are. We&apos;re better off educating them about making good choices and let them learn for themselves...also fast food isn&apos;t necessarily bad, there are some good choices on the menu. And even&quot;junk food&quot;isn&apos;t such a bad thing so long as it&apos;s a sometimes food. Kids will never learn to do these things in moderation if they aren&apos;t allowed to do them at all. I feel we attach too much psychological importance to these foods if we make them completely taboo.

 I think part of a well-rounded education is not only teaching children how to use their minds but also how to care for their bodies. I think a successful program would give children several different healthy options to choose from, backed up with the re-introduction of gym class and healthy living discussions in science class so kids understand why they need to make healthy choices. Part of the reason why fast food is allowed on some campuses is because the school gets paid by the franchise for the privilege. It will be difficult giving fast food the boot until the schools replace the money they&apos;re getting from the franchises with money from a different source, without strings attached.

 NO NO NO NO NO.

Just the calorie count alone is enough reason. Obesity is a serious problem in this country. Then the quality of the meat - full of preservatives, hormones, and antibiotics. And what are they going to serve them to drink - cola? Milkshakes? Baaaaad for you. Cola rots your bones. Kids are getting osteoporosis by the time they&apos;re in their teens!!

Kids should be served a choice of two or three lunch plates - all having protein, complex carbs, and vegetables. Even if they don&apos;t like vegetables, they might eat them just because they&apos;re hungry, or because they&apos;re sitting there on their plate.

They should be given a choice of water, milk or juice for a beverage. NEVER cola, ever, ever. Schools should be promoting a healthy diet. Healthy brains do better at schoolwork, too.

 By all means. And they should be all you can eat, for free.

The world is severely over populated (we could kill 999 out of every 1000 humans and still have a fully functioning population, and a lot less problems), so the means to have all those incapable of reasoning and self control kill themselves with heart attacks before graduation can only improve matters.

Oh, and lets stop wasting money on guardrails, warning signs, safety barriers and banisters. This can be used to pay for the free food.

Also, smoking and non-smoking classrooms (No need to put a teacher in the smoking classroom. It&apos;s not like they&apos;ve shown any ability to learn anyway). Free ciggies in the smoking section.

 If there were fast food restuarants in schools our country would have a problem with 200 pound nine year olds. It would just be contributing to america&apos;s obesity epidemic. we are already the fattest nation out there and adding fast food restaurants would only make people fatter. Instead, as you stated, they should be getting a healthy well balanced luch.

You should definitely cover the obestiy issue in your essay. Maybe compare a typical healthy school lunch to a typical fast food lunch. Happy Writing :)

 I agree with you completely. Fast food is unhealthy and will make children gain too much weight.
In my opinion, there should be cooking lessons at school (we had those at our school, at least we girls had), and they should serve healthy meals where the kids can still have a choice and choose their favourite combination, e.g. baked potatoes or wholemeal pasta or rice, etc... in combination with veggies like cauliflower, carrots, peas, broccoli, mushrooms etc... and some healthy sauce. There should be some quorn options too in order to provide for protein.
As a dessert, a nice pudding wouldn&apos;t do any harm. The main thing is that the meal as such is wholesome, healthy, with enough vitamins and minerals. They could drink mineral water, juice and tea.
I&apos;m sure the kids would like that, but for the school, it would be more work to organise. But that shouldn&apos;t be a reason not to do it.

 I agree with you.

But, what type of schools? Just secondary and primary schools not be allowed to have fast food restaurants? That makes the most sense. Children will eat anything not healthy for them.

But my college (post-secondary) has a Chick Fil-A on campus. I think that&apos;s okay, because we&apos;re educated enough to know whether or not we want to have junk food or not.

I think it depends on how well the child is educated on healthy food or something.

 Fast food rest. typically serve high fat, high cholestoral (can&apos;t think how to spell that right now! ha ha). I would rather see a food cart loaded up with apples, oranges, bananas, kiwi, melons, fresh veggies,etc., as a lunch or snack choice. If I were you, I would check (online) those fast food restaurants fat content, etc. List them and then list healthy foods. Chicken, turkey, lean meats (no gravy), nuts,
veggies. Even low cal veggie pizza (cold) is great!

 On college campuses I don&apos;t think there is anything wrong with it. But not in elementary, middle or high schools. I do think Subway is safe for those schools though, not Wendy&apos;s or McDonald&apos;s etc...
When I was in middle and high school (in the 90&apos;s) our burgers were soy they were pretty tasty.

 Some fast food choices are healthier than others. I still agree with you, but you&apos;ll need to get several sources together and cite them all to build your argument. Good luck.
