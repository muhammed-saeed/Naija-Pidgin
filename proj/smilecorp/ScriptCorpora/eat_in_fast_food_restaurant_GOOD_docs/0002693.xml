There are roughly 420 calories in a home cooked burger and around 400 in a burger from a burger joint . It really depends on the the size of burger and whats inside it.

 Exact Measurements of Calories In Burgers 

Because it really depends on how you cook it and whats you put on it the number can vary. For example a grilled burger looses more fat during cooking than one that is fried. Also loading it up with sauces such as mayo and ketchup will significantly increase the amount of overall calories in the burger. To roughly estimate the calories in a home cooked burger take 400 calories and add on more for each additional filling (cheese, bacon, onion rings, ketchup etc)

 Calories In Burgers From MacDonalds, Burger King&amp;Other Burger Joints 

The best way to find the calories in burgers you buy is look on the packaging, it will show the calories measured pretty accurately. Some examples are shown below:

 Burger King Whopper 670 Calories Burger King Cheeseburger 300 Calories MacDonalds BigMac 540 Calories MacDonalds Hamburger 250 Calories

There are around 420 calories in a home cooked burger and around 325 in a burger from a burger joint.

A hamburger is a type of a sandwich that consists mainly of beef. The main ingredient for a hamburger is the beef patty. The meat in the burger can either be grilled, broiled, steamed or fried. This patty is then covered with many different toppings and condiments like onion rings and vegetables. They are then closed inside a baked bun and are ready to be served. Hamburgers are generally served along with Potato chips, onion rings or French fries. 

One of the biggest hamburger chains in the world is McDonalds. It is one of the largest fast food restaurant chains in the world. It was founded by Dick and Mac McDonald. It was founded on the 15th of May 1940 in San Bernardino, California.

It depends on the hamburger patty because you can have lean meat which would be less but the average is about 300 calories with nothing on it.

 When you fry something in a pan, and leave the meat to be cooked in that same grease, you aren&apos;t getting something that&apos;s good for you.

If you grill the meat, then there&apos;s a better chance that the fat is going to drip away and burn off, therefore you aren&apos;t getting all the fat that would be stuck to the meat like in a frying pan. Hope this helps.

It really depends on how you cook it and what you put on it. For example a grilled burger looses more fat during cooking than one that is fried. Also loading it up with high sugar sauces such as mayo and ketchup will significantly increase the amount of overall calories in the burger.
