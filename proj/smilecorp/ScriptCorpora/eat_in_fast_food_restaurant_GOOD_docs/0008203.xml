 Easy question. McDonalds! And ofcourse I would dare to invite Michael. I bet he likes it too, haha! I also love the Italian Pizzeria around the corner here!
I&apos;m quite easy with food though, I eat everything. My family calls me the &apos;trashcan&apos;.

Whitney

 I don&apos;t know if Showmars would be considered fast food, but I love that place and I would invite MB to eat there. Greek food rocks!

 Taco Bell! I adore the chicken quesadilla and the ground beef taco supreme!!!

At one point, (when I was being really bad,) I would jump in my car, get it to go, take it home and eat it all alone....didn&apos;t want my husband to know how disgusting I was being!!!!). However, I did this for one week straight, even though as I was doing it, I just felt the pounds creeping on and was totally upset with myself.

I haven&apos;t had it in approximately 8 months...and I feel so much better as I&apos;m now 30 pounds lighter and back to my old self!!!

...by the way, nothing beats McDonald&apos;s french fries!!!!

 I LOVE Taco Bell!!! Bean burritos and taco supremes. Back in college after a night out we would go there after the club and get nachos bel grande. YUMMY!!

I love Wendy&apos;s Spicy Chicken combo meal and if I go to McDonald&apos;s its the Double Cheeseburger Value meal. To top it off I have to go to the convenience store and get my Route 44 Diet Coke and a Snickers.

 We don&apos;t have Taco Bell here! At least, not that I know off!!
Ahh...I simply love McDonalds! Always take the Super McNugget menu, with big size Diet Coke, big french fries, 6 nuggets and I always order an extra hamburger

 Oh, gee....look what you started..I&apos;m controlling myself not to jump into my car right now...but one of my faves is Tommy&apos;s Hamburgers. They serve up one of the best chile burgers and hot-dogs around. If you want really sloppy, greasy, and very satisfying fast food, try a Tommy&apos;s hamburger...jeane

 My favorite fast food in the city is A&amp;W.;Teen Burger with Onion Rings and a big cup of Diet Root Beer. Of course I always put one of two onion rings on the burger. That is the best way to eat their burgers and they used to sell them like that.

In my hometown my favorite fast food is a local joint that has great poutine. Now that&apos;s nasty stuff but every couple of months it tastes really great. ha ha ha.

 I am a Subway addict. There are about 10 subways all within 5 blocks of my school.
I just get the tuna with hot peppers and lettuce on whole wheat. I seriously use up a sub club card every other week.
