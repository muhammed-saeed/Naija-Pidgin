Happy Meal Ban: Middle Schoolers Write to Supes, Critique Toys

 Here&apos;s what I think you should say, kids 
​ 
 Six dozen students at a middle school in Brentwood, a suburb 55 miles to the east, wrote to San Francisco City Hall Oct. 15 to voice views on Supervisor Eric Mar&apos;s proposed ban on Happy Meal toys , which is scheduled to be heard at today&apos;s board meeting. 
 Unlike hysterical news pundits, who&apos;ve suggested the bill endangers freedom itself , the seventh graders&apos; verdicts came down both for and against the measure, with views based on more prosaic concerns such as whether or not the toys suck.

Joey, like the other students, had his last name excised for privacy. Like well-raised children through time, Joey has clear ideas about behavioral cause and effect. He was therefore appalled that Happy Meal toys had been allowed to exist in the first place.

 UPDATE:  Happy Meal Ban Passes-- With Veto-Proof Majority 
 
 
​ &quot;Rewarding kids for eating poorly??&quot; Joey wrote. &quot;Kids will just [want] to come
 back for more McDonald&apos;s Happy Meals if they feel that they are being 
rewarded for eating it.&quot;

Even if it were acceptable to reward children for self-destructive behavior, Joey wrote, the Happy Meal toy would still be perverse.

&quot;Some
 parents say that toys are &apos;convenient&apos; and are fun for their children 
to play with,&quot; wrote Joey, who, like the other Brentwood kids who wrote City Hall, was fulfilling a classroom 
assignment. &quot;On the other hand, I do not agree with this statement because 
the toys that are being made for these Happy Meals are cheap, plastic, 
boring, and waste of money.&quot;

Josue weighed in with similar sentiments. He supported Mar&apos;s concerns about the idea off children being induced to eat greasy, sugary, salty McDonalds food. And he questioned the idea that there&apos;s much harm in banning restaurants from handing out garbage toys with garbage food.

&quot;The toy that you buy in the store may cost more then the Happy Meal toy, but that toy can do much more then the toy from the Happy Meal,&quot; Josue noted.

According to Edna Hill Middle School seventh-grade teacher Marci Parish, the kids were encouraged to write to show off their critical thinking skills. And the letters indeed offered a diversity of opinions, supported by worthwhile insights.

Alexis, for instance, had no problem with San Francisco public officials regulating the contents of Happy Meals. But she thought a toy ban was going too far.

 Knowing that Happy Meals are extremely unhealthy and cause obesity if eaten on a day to day basis, maybe, instead of simply banning toys, we can put a little list of all the nutrition facts in a happy meal. 

 Chad, meanwhile, said responsibility shouldn&apos;t be placed on restaurants, but rather parents.

 The toys are said to be the problem when it&apos;s the parents who don&apos;t know what their kids are eating. If you take out the toy in the happy meal then it would have to be called the sad meal!

Wow that is rude. These kids are smart thats why they give logical responses with proof. FYI, if you ate Mc Donalds once a week you would be obese. From their answers they don&apos;t have a fat ass if they&apos;re saying Mc Donalds isnt nutritional. Your the one that&apos;s lazy, not doing something productive, and has a fat ass!
 
Look if the people don&apos;t like what the kids are eating so what if you don&apos;t like it dont&apos;t try it what is the point. Another thing is that the Big mac the double chessburger are the same as the happy meals the happy meals have a toy, small chessburger,apples, fries, and soda just a little bit in each one and the combos of there they have a BIG burger,large fries, and a big soda what is the point it is all the same.
 
How much of your freedom are you willing to trade for your feelings of security? How much of the constitution are you people going to shread before you realize you have no rights anymore? I spent 8 years in the US Armed Forces. I ETSed out because I refuse to defend people who are stealing my rights, I earned my rights not only by birth but offering to die in some third world toilet! so I leave this to you Mr/Ms wine sipping communist D*** Suck Get out and stay out of my rights and freedoms your forced views are not wlecome here! If this peeves you, well I guess you will have to live with your disappointment. As for me I will eat what I want when I want smoke and drink and live my life as I see fit not how you THINK I should live. Take your diet BS and shove it because I am tired of hearing you people complain about anything and everything, life isn&apos;t a bowl of cherries and the world is not made of puppy dogs, lollipops and rainbows deal with your problems like everyone else does and stop forcing your views on everyone because you don&apos;t like something....I no longer care what you think or if your feelers get hurt your pathetic and disgusting to me.
 
Addendum to my earlier comment...Everyone preaches eat healthier feed your kids healthier but until the price of health food drops drastically in this economy people are going to buy the chips and cookies and junk food to eat beacuse its more cost effective. when you can get to bags of chips for the price of 4 apples and you have several mouths to feed on a set income im sorry if your honest and realistic you yourselves will say your getting the chips theyll go further and last longer. So until its more cost effective to buy healthy people arent going to eat healthy
 
Ok some of you guys really need to grow up calling kids a bunch of fat lazy assses its you that blowa their self esteem and confidence and the wont go outside and do anything for fear of being ridiculed SO GROW UP. As for the assignment i thik it was a great idea and allows them the ability to voice their opinions in a safe enviroment,However i completely disagree with the ban ALL 3 of my kids have had the happy meals strictly for the toys and they are not over weight because i kept them active My kids are the only ones at their school to not have video games and are alloted so much computer and tv time the rest is on other activities, its the parents resposibility to manage their kids wait not restaraunts.Everything that used to be fun as a child is being taken away from these kids and its completely unfair. I have a preschooler who ddue to different change cant have parties at school cant take treats and the structure of the class is ridiculous im all for learning but preschool is about teaching interaction with others how to play with others gettting adjusted to spending days in the classromm encouraging imagination now days its structure structure structure leave them alone already let be kids and enjoy child hood they grow up fast enough as it is.Give them the damn happy meal and let them enjoy childhood and but the blame where it needs to be on the parents.
 
They should seriously do one better and arrest any parent that lets their child eat at McDonald&apos;s for abuse. I&apos;m tired of health insurance going up and up because fat, lazy americans think happy meals are somehow protected by the constitution.
 
Forget labeling the type of government, let&apos;s talk humanity here. In some wonderful countries, some of the happiest countries, the government cares about their people--gives mothers real maternity leave, for example, to take care of /love their children. What&apos;s not to love about that? Look what happens when nobody steps in--companies hungry for money make excuses when children can&apos;t even walk across a room without losing their breath due to obesity/diabetes, etc. 500-600 lb. is Not a normal weight for a person, and doesn&apos;t make for happiness, either. Anyone can laugh at us flat-stomached, exercise and health nuts all they want--we&apos;ll be laughing all the way to 90+.
 
Really- banning toys from kids. I raised a 16 year old with perfect body weight and he ate McDonalds on the average of twice per month. Can we please get government out of our &apos;personal&apos; lives? Kudos to the teacher for encouraging her students to act in a &apos;critical manner&apos; and be part of the discussion. Boo Hoo &apos;unhappy&apos; San Francisco!
 
The teacher(s) involved with these students are doing a great job in encouraging them to understand how different things affect their lives and to think with understanding. 
The ban comes from the same people who re-elect Nancy Pelosie after the horrendous job she has done for California, and putting Jerry Brown back as Govenor after his wrecking the California economy the last time he was Govenor. That shows how credible they are telling people how to eat and what is good for them.
 
First Smoking and now Happy Meals. This is turning into a Communist Country.
 
I didn&apos;t know we lived in a communist country.
 
obesity is ones own fault. mcdonalds gave the people a choice with the apples and milk. dont blame the resturants b/c you cant say NO to your children. Always trying to blame someone else for ones problems. lets try taking the gaming stations aways from our kids and telling them to go play outside......im just saying or maybe go play some catch or ride bike with them...good habbits start with the parents.
 
&quot;Happy Meal ban passed: San Francisco says no to toys&quot;Yeah, there&apos;s no reason why they should be gay and fat. Kinda funny what both of their mothers or both of their fathers consider edible though, ain&apos;t it?
 
Right wing action? Are you kidding? A move like this is such an obvious attempt by the nanny lefties to control or quell something they feel is &apos;unhealthy&apos; or &apos;inappropriate&apos; and just another attempt at control - possibly in the name of the recently passed national health care agenda BY THE LEFT. Get your facts and your history straight, be honest with yourself and look at who&apos;s behind this kind of nonsense legislation. It&apos;s ALWAYS a leftie. ALWAYS, no exceptions.
 
CALIFORNIANS LEADING THE WAY TO WELLFAIR BANKRUPTCY AND COMMUNISM.
 
a very slippery slope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lets tell people what they can eat. what they can say. what they can wear. why not let people invade our borders tell us what we as a country can do. YOU ALREADY DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
COMMUNISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
 
COMMUNISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
This whole thing is the start of the slippery slope to regulations on what we eat. I agree with those that say we are making thin people suffer. I am a thin person, and I remember the extra charge on sugar containing products to&quot;help combat obesity.&quot;This is an unfair burden on myself and others like me. I am allergic to artificial sweeteners. I become violently ill if I consume them. So now I have to pay extra because of the bursting waistline of America. I fear that this will start this trend again, and force people like myself into paying for those that can not, or will not control themselves, and believe that it is always someone else&apos;s fault.
 
This is UnAmerican. I hope McDonald sues San Fransisco. It violates their constitutional rights. What about Burger King and Wendy&apos;s. They also have toys.
 
Democracy is nothing but mob rule. This is why we are supposed to be, and in fact founded as, a Republic. Individuals voting to limit what a business can or can&apos;t sell or what an individual can or can&apos;t buy are primitive and cowardly. They pretend to be peaceful while hiding behind the government guns that force the rest of us to conform to their wishes.

It&apos;s all fine and well until the guns are pointed at you.
 
If the government is so concerned about the weight of our children then they should look into our physical education in our schools. Actually truth be known they need to look at the lack of PE in schools. We all know lack of activity leads to being over-weight. 
Quit blaming an inanimate object such as toy for our children being over-weight and start concentrating on getting our kids geared towards a more physical lifestyle.
As for the toys being cheap and not fun... remember the letters were written by middle schoolers. Younger children may and do enjoy them more. All of my children have saved many of their toys through the years as collectibles. They were not over-weight children as they had many physical activities to counter balance their intake.
I for one am sick and tired of elected officials taking over the raising of our children... this tops it all!
 
I am not thrilled this vote went through. I could care less about McDonald&apos;s personally, my kids don&apos;t eat there because I make that choice for them, as they are too young to make that choice themselves. But, I fear that this is a step in the wrong direction for freedom of anything. Let me explain, if I can.....

McDonald&apos;s, as a company, has to abide by the rules, laws, and regulations in place for the entire restaurant industry for food safety. And yes, the nutritional information for their food is now available on websites, and in the restaurant itself, at least where I live. If we, as parents, choose to allow our children to eat such food, either as a treat, or on a daily basis, that is OUR decision. Do you really think that taking the ten cent toy out of the meal is going to stop kids from wanting burgers and fries? I don&apos;t think so. And do we really expect parents, who do the McDonald&apos;s thing when they have no time to cook a meal at home, or want to give the kids a treat, or heck, just do it because they are the parent and they can, to stop doing so just because they took the dang toy out?? Be realistic people.....the toy doesn&apos;t matter. 

Apples and milk, in combination with the chicken nuggets, or heck, even the burger, help to make this a slightly less disastrous meal than the fries and a soda, and parents have that option now, and have for a few years. Make choices for yourselves, and live with the consequences of those choices. Stop sitting around waiting for someone else to tell you how to feed, dress, give treats to your children. Be responsible for YOUR OWN choices, and learn to live with the consequences of them as well. The government most assuredly should NOT be making personal food choices for us. And if anyone thinks that just the toy was the reason that Happy Meals were so popular, they need to take a look at McDonald&apos;s ads for the last....oh I don&apos;t know, FOREVER...and see just how little the dang toy is really pushed anymore. Now, if you want to do something about a six foot tall clown in a funny yellow suit, who stalks kids in the park, in their homes, and in the restaurant itself, well, that we can do something about...and the red box, with the giant yellow M on it.....that can go too. That is the most pushed thing in the ads. Now, do we see where this could potentially lead? Come on people, let&apos;s do some thinking for ourselves for a change.

And as for the teacher that had her kids do this letter writing assignment, and think critically about this issue, I say good for her. Make them think about the issues, and make them stand by their opinions. Not everyone will have the same one, but if you believe in yours, stand up for it, whether it is the same as mine or not. That is an inalienable right given to us by the Constitution of this Nation. Free speech, whether you agree with each other or not....don&apos;t forget that. Our right to free speech does not mean we have to always agree. It is our right to disagree, to argue, to stand by our opinions, no matter that it might not be the popular one. If you want to stand up and shout&quot;God Bless America&quot;you better be prepared to tolerate it when someone else shouts out&quot;God has nothing to do with it&quot;. (Don&apos;t turn this into a religion debate, that was just an example of differing opinions that tend to get heated) My point is simply that both of those opinions have a right to be heard, in equal measure, by virtue of the First Amendment to the Constitution. 

Boy, has this gotten lengthy....I apologize for my rambling. My simple point is, if you are going to regulate the restaurant industry in a hope to force people to eat healthier, that is taking away our freedom to make those choices for ourselves. If we want to weigh 300lbs and eat McDonald&apos;s every day, that is our right. It might not be healthy, and it might not be monetarily a good choice, but in the end it is OUR choice, not the Government&apos;s choice to be making for me. Regulate the quality of the food, as you should for safety reasons, make sure they are cooking it properly and following cleanliness regulations, but don&apos;t try to tell them what they can and can&apos;t offer on the menu, provided they are legally licensed to do so.
 
Make YOUR own decission!!! YOU can choose to eat there or not! But to go and ban a toy for a kid omg.... must get a life and quit objecting me and my family to your rules.... Less Goverment is Better.
I guess if they where giving joints away to parents for buying a happy meal for their kids would be OK in San Francisco!

Go Giants.......
 
I am thrilled this vote went through. It is a fantastic opportunity to start moving in the right direction towards healthier meals for kids. To those that say it&apos;s up to the parents to set limits, I say of course, but we don&apos;t live in a bubble and society is not making it easy AT ALL for parents. There are junk food ads at every turn, including in schools where Ronald McDonald reads to kids and his picture is on report cards and coupons are given for Happy Meals. There are also ads on TV, video games, CDs, cell phones, clothing, product placements, and more, and junk food wherever kids go. Is a child ever far from something junky to eat?? We need to start moving towards a culture that supports parents, where the HEALTHY choice is the easiest choice, and there isn&apos;t junk food everywhere we go-- and in this case junk food with a toy as a reward for eating it, as Joey insightfully noted. Check out this great link with FAQs about food politics: http://www.appetiteforprofit.com/faqsonfoodpolitics.html
 
Can u people read!! No one is telling anyone what or what not to eat! im so sick of all of these comments complaining about the gov telling us what to eat! I mean seriously did you even read the article or are you so hell bent on going to extremes? This entire article has been taken out of context! you people are so easily led that someone could tell you the sky was falling and you would believe it. Think for yourselfs instead of getting all riled up over the wrong thing. Yes, parents should regulate what their kids eat. But no one in San Francisco has said anything about keeping people from eating at McDonalds. Eat there everyday if you want to. Im so sick of people taking everything out of context just so they can argue or start some sort of over rated revolution over nothing. 
I could care less about this law, I dont live in California and I banned buying kids meals with toys in them a long time ago. I refused to buy them when my kid was little because i knew she only wanted the toy, and she would rarely eat the meal. 
people leaving these comments are like an angry mob or some sort of group think mentality. maybe some of you could benefit from the teacher mentioned in the article. You are in need of some critical thinking skills because many of you have taken a few facts and come to all sorts of conclusions. Think for yourselves, and you will realize that your freedom to eat what you choose has not been tampered with.
 
Why don&apos;t they ban cigarettes?
 
Way, way too much government control in our lives. I ate McDonald&apos;s a lot and am quite thin. I blame it on the parents and the kids sitting around watching TV instead of being outside playing as we did when I was a kid. I hate it when someone makes an issue, but focuses on the wrong cause. Government, get out of my personal choices.
 
Hello people are we missing the point? God people if you don&apos;t like greasy food don&apos;t buy it. It has been known for quit a while how unhealthy the fast food restaurants food is. If I want to buy a kids meal with a crappy toy that is my choice. Don&apos;t the politicians of San Fransisco have other meaningful issues to vote on? My god it&apos;s a frickin toy in a greasy meal. Move on people!!! Businesses have a right to sell what they want and on how to market the product. Are we going to attack the super markets for how they conveniently place products for kids that are not healthy at the child&apos;s height? example cookies, candy, sugary cereals, etc.
 
Way to go for passing the buck and blaming someone else for our mistakes. Maybe we should ban the parents for letting their kids eat crap food all the time. Kids need their parents to guide them and teach them right from wrong and that everything is ok in moderation. Moderation is NOT eating fast food everyday. A happy meal once a week isn&apos;t going to harm you, however, a happy meal everyday of the week will. It&apos;s common sense, and seeing how most people think common sense means blaming others for our mistakes, this country is truly screwed. McDonald&apos;s is not holding a gun to your head, forcing you to eat their products. It makes you wonder who actually wear the pants in the household, the children or the parents? I don&apos;t want to hear any crapjack story about how nobody has time to cook and they are very busy, blah blah blah. I work a full time job while attending school, juggling my husbands schooling and 4 children including a special needs daughter. We MAKE time to cook for our children. Get off your lazy asses and be parents to your children!
 
Whether or not you agree or disagree with happy meal toys, it comes down to this and this only. It is not the responsibility of the government to tell you how to eat or what package deals come with an item when its sold. Whats next? A ban on football channels on TV because it promotes laziness and beer drinking? The fact of the matter is, it is up to the parents, children, and there families as to what they eat. Anyone who disagrees are giving up the first of many of there freedoms. In fact i think too much time and oney on this topic has been wasted already!!!!!!!!
 
This is California afterall. Maybe they should put codoms with instructions in the happy meal

This kid Joey in the article states,&quot;On the other hand, I do not agree with this statement because the toys that are being made for these Happy Meals are cheap, plastic, boring, and waste of money.&quot;Maybe this kid feels this way because he is too old to play with them anyway. Most kids younger than middle school age do like the toys and don&apos;t think they are cheap and boring.
 
...hmmmm? No toy in the Happy Meal, yep that should do it!
 Really isn&apos;t childhood obesity a parenting issue not a marketing one? Not to defend fast food chains and their marketing tatics but as a nation we have surrendered our nutritional responsibilities to expedience and convienence. 
 Quite frankly our relentless pursuit of&quot;the American Dream&quot;has led to two income households w/ no full time caregivers or in many cases one parent one income households where the preperation of nutritous meals is a distant memory.
 Here&apos;s a news flash if parents dictated what their kids ate resturants would advertise those items.
 
How many of you idiots actually read the article all the way through? The children had well rounded opinions on whether this law was right or wrong. Some agreed, some disagreed. Many said the parents should be responsible, not McDonalds; THAT IS CRITICAL THINKING. I really hate it when people only read three lines of an article and then run their mouths. It makes these kids look ten times smarter than you.
 
I&apos;m more concerned about the millions upon millions of plastic junk happy meal toys that get thrown away and ultimately end up clogging up our land fills....all that cheap junk is such a waste....
 
Thank God I still live in America where Big Brother can tell what,where and how I can eat,smoke and what I can buy for my kids when I want. Please won&apos;t the Government help me decide what to wear. We can&apos;t take care of our Elderly or our Homeless or Feed 1/4 of the kids in this country but we can have more rules to take away people&apos;s freedoms. If America&apos;s economy is based on buying and selling what we want to then with rules like this is it any wonder our Economy is in the toilet.
 
I remember eating a lot of McDonald&apos;s as a kid. My children eat it quite often as well. I am still very fit because I stay active in adult sports leagues. I could never gain mass (when weightlifting) growing up no matter how hard I tried. My kids are the same, not an ounce of fat on them. it&apos;s genetic. My cholesterol is fine too, despite the fact I eat a lot of shellfish. The key is moderation and not eating when you are full just for the sake of finishing a meal. WIth that said, my kids would be sad if they banned happy meals, and I would in turn be sad for them.
 
It all goes back to the saying Guns dont kill people people do !!!!! 

why should we shut down cause you have no will power or self esteem to stay the hell out these places 

im sick and tired of having new laws and standards lowerd to help the less fortunate feel accepted if your fat your fat its not the foods faught you have to put the food in your mouth it aint going to get inside you no other way 

jsut like talking on the cell phone behind the wheel its now a law because toomany idiots wreck cause they werent paying attention to the road, but todays society says its not that poor lil girls faught she wrecked there should be a law saying you cant use them and then she wouldnt have wrecked 

you know what would be a good law !!!! stupid people should be not be allowed to reproduce !!!!!!!!!!!
 
One more reason not to live in California. The state is broke regulation is way too high and all Frisco can think about is controling our diets. Mcdonalds should close up shop and leave the area. Why give Frisco the taxes. I wonder if these same council members are for legalization of pot?
 
I ate very few happy meals as a kid. my parents were smart enough and involved just enough to make sure i was stuffing my face with crappy food all the time. stop blaming companies for everyone&apos;s problem, they are trying to make money, that&apos;s what they are supposed to do, blame crap parents for not teaching and disciplining their children. If i had to have a toy from McDonald&apos;s, my parents would buy the happy meal, my mom would eat the fries, i got water or juice to drink, and then i got the tiny burger, and that was maybe 4-5-6 times a year!
 
I think that it is a good thing to let each kids have their own mind and thoughts, But really do you see the fat little kids driving themself to any fast food? NO it is the wonderful parents that more in likely just and fat and lazy and their kids. Why hurt the parents that have control over their kids food intake? MY four year old loves every toy that he has gotten in a&quot;Happy Meal&quot;so what the need to do is ask the age group of kids that should be getting&quot;happy Meals&quot;NOT 7h grader tht more inlikely haven&apos;t had a&quot;happy Meal&quot;in years

I am not sure why the Happy Meal is being attacked. The parents who are feeding their children 20 Happy Meals a month should be the ones under the gun here... but hey, our society is so amazingly great and deflecting what the true issues are. Why should we expect anything else here. I mean, it&apos;s nice to hear that kids are taking a stand... but they are being led in the wrong direction as to accepting responsibility accordingly. THE PARENTS are the ones who are responsible, not the Happy Meal, not the Fast Food industry.
 
I think is is crazy to hold McDonalds responsible for children eating the HAppy meal. Parents need to learn one word and that is&quot;NO&quot;I have used Happy meals as a treat for my own kid and not as a regular part of their diet. Next, we will be holding Hallmark accountable for promoting birthdays and try to elimate the cake.
 
Kudos for the teacher? Actually, this type of assignment is not encouraging&quot;independent thinking. What is in fact doing is forcing to close another market. Parents should be the ones responsible and blamed for their own kids obesity, not McDonald&apos;s. Seriously, that teacher should not be praised for this assignment, basically what she is doing is pointing fingers and causing our new generations to make the same mistakes that our current generation is actually doing: BLAME OTHERS FOR THEIR MISTAKES. GREAT JOB TEACHER AND SUPPORTERS. Freedom and respect is what needs to be taught in schools.
 
QUOTE:&quot;I feel that if I want my kids to have a happy meal or anything thing else for that matter should be left up to me. The government can&apos;t get itself together and yet, feel they know what&apos;s best for me and mine&quot;. ~~Apparently you don&apos;t know what&apos;s best for you and yours if you stuff a Happy Meal down your kids&apos; throats - who let you be a parent? That food is garbage. Furthermore, this is a local government issue, not a state or national government issue. Don&apos;t confuse the two unless you live in that area and can safely say the town government is just as bad as the rest of the US. mmkay?
 
OMFG people it&apos;s just food. You can still be healthy and big at the same time. you can&apos;t stop poeple or kids for wanting something thats so tasty to certain peoples toungues. If banning the kids meal is happening why not make heb and walmart and other places ban fatting foods. It Fn stupid. It&apos;s like saying lets band music because its to loud, or to quite, or boring or football because its just people throwing a oval like ball...its dumb get over it, people get fat kids get fat, most of you are probably fat being just hypocrites making yourselves sound smart. Instead of trying to band drugs, and alcohol, your to buisy rampaging about a Fn Happy Meal!!!
 
My son doesnt eat happy meals for the cheap toys, he eats them for the French Fries, if your children eats happy meals once or twice a week and doesnt just sit around playing games and watch the television they are and will be fine, but if they are eating 2 happy meals at a time and sittin around, well then that is the kids and the parents fault, i dont know about you all but i cant get my kid to sit around much. Its not the toys or the happy meals that are making kids fat, it is the lack of dicipline that parents can give there kids these days, your kids are fat and lazy because the parents are soft and let them get away with everything, try getting your kid to work in the yard with you these days, pfff
 
Gigi,the only thing more impressive than your classiness is your lack of knowledge. Let me get this straight, your&quot;theory&quot;is that McD vegetables aren&apos;t 100% natural because they&quot;have no taste&quot;. That is pure brilliance! Carry on classy lady!
 
&amp;#64; John O&apos;Keefe-

You words are so true and I completely agree. CA is f***ing pathetic; their real purpose is to distract us with mindless insignificants instead of the real problems. 

@ Proud to be thin-

WTF is wrong with you? Could you be anymore prejudice and disgusting?

There are more than one reason people are overweight. Your ignorance is truly disturbing.

I have an idea, instead of getting rid of LARGE people, let&apos;s get rid of people that have sh** spewing from their mouth like you. People like you only have one place they&apos;re welcome... it&apos;s called HELL. May you burn and fry bit**!
 
How many children do you know that consider the quality of the toy in the kids meal? Kudos to the teacher for encouraging independent thinking! Thanks to the parents for allowing their children to participate in such a project. By 7th grade food lessons are well ingrained. It is good that the teacher is getting them to think about the effects of marketing and merchandising tie-ins.
 
I think that if you have a problem with your child eating unhealthy food then don&apos;t take them to McDonald&apos;s or any other fast food joint. Just leave it alone! Without happy meals and the toy&apos;s that go in them, it just would not be the same. We as children were never aloud to eat fast food all the time,and if we made a big fuss over it we didn&apos;t get to eat out,it was earned!The problem is parents don&apos;t want to cook for they&apos;re family anymore!
 
McDonald&apos;s offers alternatives to french fries like apples. The offer milk and juice, etc. The reality is parents allow their kids to eat and drink garbage instead of parenting. I choose to feed my kids fresh fruit every day. I limit their candy intake and they drink milk or juice. My parents used to allow me one soft drink a week and the reality is that they &apos;trained&apos; me to prefer Milk and other alternatives instead of the cheap, easy route. I&apos;m amazed how many parents let their kids tell them what to do? Bring back the happy meal and let parents do their job!
 
If the toys or food cross state lines to get to the McDonalds then local governments no longer have the authority to regulate that commerce. Under the interstate commerce clause the congress is now the only body able to regulate how Mcdonalds runs their corporation. Mcdonalds know this but are not willing to make a fight of it just yet, in order to remain the good guy fast food place. 
Start taxing them our affecting their profits and this card will be played and rightly so. In one swift move their legal team will file suit against San Fran and those that threaten their company. By placing the blame for child hood obesity squarely on the shoulders of the parents who feed their children happy meals everyday, they will show who is really at fault. Instead of blaming fast food try feeding your kids some healthy home made meals and refuse to take them out for the happy meal. Problem solved.
 
To me, this isn&apos;t so much about the food with the prize, sales gimmick, it&apos;s more insidious than that. I rebel at the thought of somebody I don&apos;t know, that doesn&apos;t know me or my family, telling me what I&apos;m allowed to eat.
 How many of these legislators are going to complain, when somebody a level higher in the government bans something that they like?&quot;The road to ruin is paved with good intentions&quot;and the slippery slope is just over the horizon. How long will it take until we get to the &apos;Soylent Green&apos; stage?
 
I hate the fact that people can make rules and regulations about what I do for myself and my family. What is this Russia? China? No.Korea? How can the government tell you whats good for you weither you like it or not, This is bullshit...... This is a Form of rape. Forcing an idea on me weither i want it or not..... These commie councilpeople should worry about themselves and not me, They have a lot to worry about
 
Gosh if Mcdonald was so awful then what is it doing all over Naval bases. Then want to comment on those Happy meals which portion of profits do go to Ronald House. When my son was diagnosis with Type 1 diabeties our family had to stay in one. It was OMG clean and the stay was beyond what i expected. Please make trip to local Ronal Mcdonald House and take trip over to Hospital see families and kids. Note it was his body gave out not Happy Meals that gave him the DIABETIES.
As far as Happy Meals and the foods Mcdonalds is not at fault for children&apos;s obseity. The chicken nuggests are carb free for my son, and then apples are great for him with juice box all he needs is small unit shot or better yet we go run it off at a park. The toys are just a wonderful idea and they pretend play with them all around the house. C&apos;mon admit you did go to fastfood resturant when you were little and mommy and daddy got u a meal came with toy. Or better yet they didn&apos;t and you never got the chance to enjoy sweet child life!
 
OK,first of all getting a kid to eat should be giving an award it would be no differnt than the dessert i was givin after a meal. it all has to do with moderation and the laziness of the kid and parent, like , after they eat, what do they do? sit and watch t.v? cuz they&apos;re easier to watch and mantain when they&apos;re in front of a tv, computer, xbox etc... cuz none of that stuff hardly requires parental assistance, so the parents, whom has had a hard days work, want to relax, NOT FIX FOOD, stuff their kids with mcdonalds with no encourgement for them to be active afterwards or at anytime of the day, wonder why are childern are obese, it&apos;s because the parents are lazy which in turn makes the kid lazy cuz thats where you want them to be, in the safe confines of the home so you dont have to worry about them outside or keep a watchfull eye over them, so you can be lazy.
mcdonandls doest make kids fat, you cant live off of it, i do believe thats not a good health choice but all foods with no exerise will make you fat
 
I can&apos;t believe how stupid most of you are!!!calling McDonalds food healthy!!!wtf...do you even look at your selves?? do you even know that all the fattest cities in the world are in US? 
for the last anonymous: who the f..k told you mcdonald&apos;s has healthy products? the only thing that might be healthy at mcdonalds is the bun. not even the vegetables are 100% natural (cause it has no taste)...but wtf would you know about healthy food, you probably never had healthy food in your entire life. Just feed it to the kids as well and you&apos;ll all die of obesity one day, stupid f..k
 
And they woke up one day at the prescribed time, and went to their kitchen and ate their presribed breakfast, and dressed as they were told, and drove the vehicle they were ordered to drive and went on their unmerry way to their prescribed job, there they performed their prescribed tasks and when lunch time came they ate their prescribed meal, and when their day was through they all thought what they had been tought to think.......and on and on and on.... this is what life will be like if we who belive in our constitution do not stand up to government officials and say enough ! We once lived in a country where we were free from tyrannical officials who think they know whats best for everyone and try to impose their will on us all. If you think this is far fetched study your history and see that it has happend time and time again. It seems such a simple thing
but every little freedom taken away from us hastens our demise and our way of life. By the time you have finnished reading this somewhere in America people have lost another freedom, take away by some politician who tells them it&apos;s for their own good. We are losing our country, ourselves, one good idea after another. 
God save us from good ideas !
 
FREEDOM OF CHOICE! Nobody feeds their kids Happy Meals everyday, anyway. If kids are fat, it&apos;s because of the food their parent feed tham at home. I like what another commenter said about cerial. Why aren&apos;t these people protesting about Fruit Loops and Lucky Charms? Can&apos;t help but feeling this has more to do with politics and business than health. Lastly, if I want to eat, or feed my kids, a Happy Meal once in a while that should be my choice. If I want my french fries cooked in peanut oil, that&apos;s my choice. If I want a deep-fried Twinkie at the fair (another thing which no one has protested yet) then that&apos;s my choice. It&apos;s called&quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;You want to educate people on nutrition? Fine. But stop forcing your views on me by taking my rights away. Socialists!
 
Typical SF mentality. Only showed the one side it favors. Last comment doesn&apos;t count it was a childs comment whereas you used the more mature responses. Mature doesn&apos;t make them right. SF is in a world all it&apos;s own. Ban toys, etc. but leagalize MJ. I don&apos;t care what you people say but I have seen it be a stepping stone to harder drugs and yes people impared when driving just as much as with alcohol. Politicians call themselves liberal but they&apos;re only liberal with things they agree with. God help you if you disagree.
 
Perhaps we should also ban all hot drinks from McDonalds too. Look at the stupid idiot dumbass that stuck a hot drink between her legs while driving, burns herself, needs plastic surgery and then blames McDonalds because a hot drink is hot and then gets millions of dollars. What an absolute dumbass.
 
Meghan, you use the terms unhealthy and garbage pretty loosely. I suspect that&apos;s the veggie talking. That&apos;s fine, but know this.The beef, chicken and pork used @ McD is 2nd to none in terms of quality and food safety. You wouldn&apos;t believe the efforts taken in those areas.
 
When are these hippies going to grow up and relize that the problem with childhood weight gain is due to the loss of PE in school, and parents not telling their kids&quot;NO&quot;. 

The last time I checked my kids don&apos;t demand to be taken to McDonalds they ask, and for now I still have the right to tell my kids&quot;No&quot;when they do. 

Banning Happy Meals is just another step in taking our rights to be parents and make choices for our own kids. 

I got an idea if you don&apos;t want your kids to get fat, then make the choice yourself not to take them, and let the rest of us decide for our own kids what is right for them.

Personnally, I don&apos;t take my kids to McDonalds very often, it is a treat when we do go, but again I have the spine to say&quot;NO&quot;to a 15, 9, and a 3 Yr old.
 
Typical conformist government trying to once again blame something on their own laziness and lack of physical health, and of course the idea was probably started by a teacher or parent, and if it really was the kid, he&apos;s probably just scared of the movie IT, and has a thing against clowns, but seriously though, happy meals ARE a treat, not a daily staple, and ARE meant for CHILDREN! The toy isn&apos;t meant as a reward for eating the meal, it is itself part of the treat! In by the way this is America, by which I simply mean, if you don&apos;t like McDonald&apos;s, dont eat there! WOW! its that simple!
 
Child Obesity because of food? How about lack of excercise? How about parenting? If you let your child sit in front of the computer or tv all day eating Happy Meals because you can&apos;t say&quot;no&quot;to them, then there is not a problem with child obesity...the problem is in the parenting. Why don&apos;t you propose a bill on that? 
Way to go San Francisco...looks like all that marijuana smoke is clouding your minds!
 
why would you want to eat fast food daily?

when i was a kid (30 years ago) going out mcdonalds or some other fast food resturant
was a treat for good behavior which in turn made it exciting.

try cooking for your children.
 
If i am seeing what all of you are seeing the assignment did not tell the kids to be for it and or not for it it was to have them look at the issue and give there voice on how they felt on the issue. we need more of this in schools the kid are going to be the ones that make the choise of the government with there voting by the way we are the ones who voted the W in to office so if how can we say that the kid can not say yes on no to a toy in a meal.have the kids start now so that they do not do what we did by puting a underachever in the office like we did we all can get some thing out of this. good job to the tech. and the school for this one.
 
I mentioned this article to my 12 year old son, he said&quot;this is what&apos;s wrong with our society, we now need the goverment to tell us what to eat and how to eat. What happened to parents just being able to say no to their kids?&quot;
 
LOL..kudos to the teacher and the students. Nice to know kids are learning how to think critically. For all of you that are hating on the kids/teacher..the gov&apos;t isn&apos;t telling them what they can&apos;t eat. San Fran is just saying McD can&apos;t give out free with unhealthy food. If the parents want their kids to have toys with their meals, then they can go and buy them! I&apos;m a registered nurse, and I think this is a GREAT idea. But, if ppl actually start eating healthy, I may start having less patients to care for! bye bye heart attacks, strokes, high cholesterol, diabetes...all of these nursing students may need to change their major!
 
HERE WE GO AGAIN! Geeeez Louise ! Now we have a bunch of slightly educated children in California babbling about happy meals. DO YOU THINK ANOTHER CALIFORNIAN TREE HUGGING TEACHER COULD HAVE MOTIVATED THEM TO DO SO???? I hope to God that we don&apos;t let 15 kids decide what a major corporation should or should not do. HEY KIDS - STICK TO YOUR F#$KING STUDIES AND LET CAPITALISM ALONE! What&apos;s next? I bet if another group of kids were up in arms about their X-BOX 360 being bad for the brain - these little tortured souls of tomorrow would be up in arms declaring&quot;LEAVE THE XBOX ALONE MAN! IT&apos;S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHAT I DO WITH MY LIFE&quot;. Enough said - but what do you expect from a bankrupt state where poverty and crime run high and produces idiots like Arnold as Governor and Nancy Pelosi. Un F#$king believable!
 
the teacher gave a writing assignment, good for her, i believe in keeping it as relevant as possible...its&apos;s just that tyring to regulate what i choose to purchase for my child to eat isn&apos;t the realm of legislatures...a little mickey d&apos;s won&apos;t hurt&apos;em now and again and we have a great collection of the happy meal toys...isn&apos;t mcdonald&apos;s wthe world&apos;s largest distributor of children&apos;s toys, always relevantly tied to a movie of something? stop hating, let parents do their jobs and mcdonalds keep on making the money...its the american way!
 
wow...you idiots could say to the McDonalds employees...&quot;I do not want the toy...&quot;Is it that hard? Try speaking up for your kids if you feel its so bad. Dont you think there is enough laws? Soon the next one is going to be whether or not we can drive, because it causes accidents...come on people. Dont you want the ability to choose for yourselves?
 
All this talk about McDonalds, makes me want a Large salty fry.... Oh, but look at that I have made the decision, it is bad for me and I will not submit to my desire.
I bet the government didn&apos;t think I could make that decision.
 
I totally agree that McDonalds is extremely unhealthy. I feel that they lure the kids in with the popular toys and that if not for the toys there is NO WAY those kids would eat that garbage. However the responsibility is TOTALLY on the parents. What are you teaching your kids by giving them excuses to be over weight. You get a personal choice what you put into your body. Accept responsibility for the choices you make. I hate McDonalds I am a vegetarian and I would never eat their food but this is just the blame game all over again. Wipe out McDonalds and there will be some one else that will be to blame. Heres my advice Stop eating fast food all together get your lazy ass in the kitchen and cook for those kids and you will not have this problem. And don&apos;t use the excuse oh I am a working mother ..bleh bleh bleh. SO AM I! I work 2.5 jobs volunteer cook clean the whole deal. Make time! You had time to wait in the drive thru..
 
I remember growing up wanting to go to Mcdonalds for a happy meal cause it made me HAPPY that I got a toy with my food. Thats marketing. But that was also my parents taking me, choosing to let me eat that food. If there is a ban on toys in a food combo, isnt that limiting the business model of Mcdonalds, and every other toy giving resturant? Not saying that they would close done because of it, but thats going against what this country belief in free enterpries. Whatever happened to the parents taking responsiblity for their actions in buying, and letting the kid(s) that they are in charge of eat junk? You raise a kid on healthy food choices, they will more than likely keep them as the grow. Same with excercising. Mcdonalds has a playground. I liked to go there too. Should THAT be taken away?
 
Come on, my kids are grown but when they were little while traveling they loved the happy meals. Yes we know that they&quot;can&quot;be bad for the children if eaten daily. However so can sugar filled cereals that have toys in them. Yes it is marketing, but good parents have the strength and respect of the child to say no and not have to endure the screaming and crying. We have all seen that brat in the store.
Ok, back to the subject; regardless if the food is bad or can be bad, the air that we breath can be bad and is much worse than 200 years ago. Does that mean the government requires each of us and our children to wear Scotts air tanks (O2/N2 mixture simular to a SCUBA tank). Hmm, how would they get that air clean... Oh, by using Carbon made from coal that creates smoke again dirtying the air. 
Processed foods are never as good as family farm raised.. Take it all off the market, while we are at it, shut down all the coal powered power plants and Nuclear power plants. It is very much like many states seat belt laws... Remember how they moved it in..&quot;if you get pulled over for any other infraction and are not wearing a seat belt, then you can receive a warning ticket. Then it moved to a ticket, now you can be pulled over in most states for not wearing a seat belt. 

Now, I am a supporter of seat belts, one saved my life. However, I do not believe the government has the right to make me wear it.

At some point we&quot;the people&quot;must be responsible for ourselves and our families.

The government needs to be that the government. Their purpose is to provide security to the people of the country, build the infrastructure and collect taxes. Yes, I know that we need to be protected from stingy/cheating business men pumping animals full of poisons, but this goes pretty much ignored.

The bottom line, the government needs to stay out of this. I believe if (21 and older) smokers want to kill themselves then so be it. If a parent is injuring their child or killing their child with diet, then we should step in. Remember the government needs to protect but not dictate.

sorry for the soap stand... I think it was a good project for the kids. However; why tie up the lawmakers with childrens writing. The teacher should have gently swooped them to a secure location garbage can, protecting the project from the children thinking it was a waste of time.
 
Of course 7th graders would find the toys boring. We are talking about what 13 year olds? They probably loved them when they were younger. 

It&apos;s a parent&apos;s job to decide what to feed their kids. Any kid over 7 can eat more food than a happy meal supplies anyway. Getting rid of the toys isn&apos;t going to stop anything but older kids will get a value meal instead and eat even more food.
 
Happy Meals aren&apos;t the problem, it is lazy kids and parents who are the problem. McDonalds isn&apos;t forcing anyone to eat Happy Meals, and maybe kids should be on computers less, playing video games less and perharps working in the yard or exercising instead.

I am tired of the Government interfering with what I eat, if I smoke, how much toilet paper I use. I pay for private insurance. The Government does me or my family no favors.
 
I wish most of you had been taught the critical thinking skills that these children are learning. It&apos;s about the marketing, not the actual toys, people. These children are inundated daily with a cutesy clown who says&quot;Collect all 6 of these!&quot;They could truly care less about the Happy Meal or the toys for that matter. But they are being trained to buy, buy, buy, simply to complete some pointless collection. 
For those of you that point out other chains that give away toys, you don&apos;t see 6 Wendy&apos;s commercials per hour during children&apos;s television, telling the kids how cool it would be to have the whole set of miniature Xmen or princesses or whatever. McDonald&apos;s (along with Disney) have completely cornered the market on indoctrinating kids into the buy it because it&apos;s there lifestyle.
 
Sparkly Markly wrote&quot;I&apos;m glad that some of these kids recognize that these toys are terrible, both for their health and for playing.&quot;Are you kidding me? The toys are as safe as any toys on the market (perhaps safer due to the possibilities of lawsuits). And how can they be terrible for their health???
McDonald&apos;s has been known worldwide for their usefulness to society, their emphasis on healthy eating (and if you visit McDonald&apos;s you will see the healthy products they offer, but it all comes down to choices. and McDonald&apos;s has many of those as well.
 
I really can care less about what the government states is healthly or unhealthly for my kids. At one point in time they said lettuce, spinach , and recenlty eggs. I bet have of the people complaining about the happy meal ate them when they were little and loved the toys in side. i also believe that the kids that are complaining about the toys are just mad it wasn&apos;t the toy they wanted or it broke after they played with it for a while.I feel why ruin it for the little childern that look forward to receiving the toy, and if you are in middle school why are you eating a HAPPY MEAL ANY WAY? You should be eating a bigger meal.
 
McDonald&apos;s O/O here. It&apos;s nice to see such diverse opinions here. I&apos;ll interject some fact. Kids can come once per week and get every toy offered. We serve many healthy choices.Each day part has entrees as well as deserts low in fat and calories.These items aren&apos;t leading the way in unit movement but are given equal marketing. This is America so we don&apos;t try to dictate but offer a range of choices. Incidentally, the happy meal toys are 0 fat grams, 0 calories.
 
I think it is absolutely ridiculous to think that taking the toy out of the Happy Meal will somehow decrease the amount of Happy Meals that are consumed. The inherent responsibility of this issue lies with the parents. 

For example, I must get asked three or four times a week from my daughter to get chicken nuggets / fries/ etc. I do what most parents do and say NO!
 
&amp;#64; Proud To Be THIN

 Fat-o-phobe.
 
To the Karen&apos;s on the list. This teacher is a great teacher who knows what she is doing. She is not wasting time teaching children how to write and think critically. 

It is not the topic of the writing that is the purpose, it is the analysis, writing and critical thinking skills that are the result and reward from the experience. This is what teaching is, for those of you that do not know, it the process, not the product.
 
Wow, living in Wisconsin, I thought we had a bunch of goofs in office! Glad to see San Fran is on the top of the heap. Telling a business owner what he/she can and cannot sell to his/her customers, what a joke. Nevermind the fact that it should be the PARENTS to decide what their children put in their bodies, or that most kids are nothing more than lazy to begin with. How much exercise are these kids getting, or are they constantly in front of the t.v, computer monitor or texting on cell phones? When will people finally wake up and realize it is about personal choices, not some cock-eyed Council members vote? When we start pushing agendas that should be left to the individual, you and I have just had another freedom taken away. PARENTS, do YOUR job! Rather than letting little Johnny/Jane sit in the house ALL day long, watching the idiot box or playing computer games, tell them to go outside and get some exercise, play with some of your friends. I am 52 years old and there was no childhood obesity problems when we were growing up. Why, you may ask? Because we only had 4 channels on T.V., we did not have video games, computers ect. If we wanted to have fun, we HAD to use OUR imagination or brain and THINK of something to do. Wow, what a concept huh? Which usually end up some sort of exercise, running around, playing basketball, baseball whatever. And hey, guess what? There WERE McDonalds, KFC Burger Kings then too, but my parents considered those types of food as, now get this, a&quot;treat&quot;rather than a STAPLE to our diets. This is NOT about restaurants, it&apos;s about being a responsible parent.
 
America grow the hell up and think for yourself for a change of pace. Our government has a hard enough time thinking for themself and can hardly do anything right because one way or another someone bitches that they are offended or don&apos;t like this or that. McDonalds if done worng can cause people to become fat. Then again though if you wish to pay $8 for a thin ass burger, fries that are hardly fresh, and a soda then go ahead. I could go to Denny&apos;s and pay less or close to that for a bigger burger with fresh fries. But to get to my point, to agree with what one kid said, Parents need to learn how to get their kids to eat with out rewarding them with toys all the time. Just playing card game, board games, aka spending time with them can be rewarding enough to a kid. I always loved playing games with my parents after dinner. So it does work.
 
I think this out-of-control corporation needs to be stopped. It can&apos;t stop there. This poison food has to be stopped overnight, all at once, along with all its charismatic, colorful, attractive, tricky, strobe lit (Don&apos;t believe me? Cut the lights and go in the next room and watch. Its like a f*@#ing club!), advertising too! Ever seen anyone outside the American beauty lines in a McDonald&apos;s commercial? Go in one for real and find someone within the American beauty lines! Equally hard! Okay, after the raids: The next day, PRINT THE INGREDIENTS LISTS AND SHOW VIDEO OF THE SOURCES OF THEIR KILLER PRODUCT AND HOW IT GOES FROM TOXIC, FECES, AND DISEASED KILLING FIELD TO HAPPY MEAL OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALL DAY LONG! Use the seized personal and corporate assets for the TV and print ads. Just a thought.
 
the government controlling what we eat, they already do. Mc D not bad for you once a week the fry&apos;s alone have so many preservative that the don&apos;t decay for over a year as a parent if you choose to poision your kids you better have good health insurance I know adults who eat this garbage 5 times a week and all they talk about is how bad they feel. DUH!
 
I like the fact that these kids worked really hard on their school work and did such a great job, but my son likes happy meals and not just for the toy, he likes the chicken nuggets and french fries. In a town where I live if you&apos;re running late and haven&apos;t had time to fix dinner this is one of the only choices that you have is McDonalds amongst a bunch of other fast food restaurants that have nothing but unhealthy food for you. Why doesn&apos;t someone who has the money come up with an idea about making a fast food restaurant with healthy foods? If I had the money I would. We need to stop depending on the government to make our decisions for us, this is the United States of America the land of the free, but yet lately it hasn&apos;t seemed that way, because the government keeps trying to make our decisions for us but yet can&apos;t get their own stuff straight. If we wanted to be ruled by our government we would move to a country where we could be. This country is going to wind up just like the rest, a BIG MESS!
 
This sound so stupid. Even if you take the toy out your child is still going to want McDonald. My oldest child still loves to eat McDonald and she don&apos;t even get a Happy Meal and she not over weight. My youngest child doen&apos;t even eat her food she only want it for the toy. This world is becoming very sad. It easy to say ban Happy Meals. But so hard to come together and stop the killing. People come on.
 
you may be right that mcdonalds doesnt always lead to obsity but it can lead to other health related issues. when i stopped eating there I dropped almost 20 lbs and lowered my cholesterol by 16 points in just 6 months.
 
love what chad wrote&quot;it would be a sad meal&quot;
 
Little Joey sounds like a bone head, and will probably grow up to be a bone headed politician-Stay in Cali Joey !!!
 
Seriously? Hey Kids...put down the video game joysticks, pick up the baseball (basketball etc.)and take your fat asses outside and do SOMETHING! I, as an adult,enjoy a happy meal. Why do the rest of us have to suffer because you&apos;re so lazy? If you&apos;re smart enough to write to city govt. then you&apos;re smart enough to make a healthy choice when eating!
 
Well of course these kids are going to be against McDonald&apos;s toys, they&apos;re middle schoolers! My 3 year old nephews love the toys they get in those happy meals. They pretty much just take the toys, go off and play with them, leaving the food. Sometimes I get happy meals for the toys, and I&apos;m 25. I don&apos;t really play with toys unless I&apos;m playing with my nephews, but they&apos;re still nice to collect and have around.
