Snow Hill Bojangles&apos; robbed Wednesday

SNOW HILL—A Farmville man was arrested Wednesday and charged with the second armed robbery to take place at the same local Bojangles’restaurant in a month.

Snow Hill police, with the assistance of the Greene County Sheriff’s Office, arrested Justin Lamar Tyson, 22, of 142 Burnette Road in Farmville, a little more than five hours after he allegedly robbed the Bojangles’at 1035 Kingold Blvd.

Snow Hill Police Chief John Rea told local media he had used a handgun to hold up the Bojangles’around 6:40 a.m., with customers present.

Some customers had no idea a robbery was taking place.

“The girl that waited on me, she didn’t act like anything was going on,”said Snow Hill Town Clerk Cathy Webb, who went through the drive-thru line around 6:30 a.m.

Webb said she goes to the restaurant every morning—usually later in the morning, but she stopped by early on Wednesday before a 7 a.m. hair appointment.

Chatoya Thompson, a cashier at the Trade Wilco convenience store and gas station across the highway, arrived for work at 4 a.m. Wednesday. She said she did not notice anything unusual at the time of the robbery, though.

“I didn’t know what was going on until a customer came in and informed me Bojangles’just got robbed again,”she said.

The Bojangles’had been robbed in late January by several men who have since been arrested and charged with a string of fast food restaurant robberies across Eastern North Carolina.

Rea said Tyson was not connected with those suspects. Tyson was being held in the Greene County jail on $50,000 bond, charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon.

The Bojangles’remained open Wednesday, with a steady stream of customers coming in. The restaurant’s employees and manager declined comment, and referred questions to their corporate parent, Tands Inc. of Kinston.

A Tands representative could not be immediately reached for comment.

Several robberies have taken place around Snow Hill so far this year, including one at a Dollar General on Second Street earlier this month.

Thompson, who said she was born and raised in Snow Hill, said she had never seen so many armed robberies at once, and that the operators of her business takes measures to educate employees on what to do during a holdup.

“This is the most I have ever heard of stores being robbed in this town, within the length of time that they have happened,”she said.

Rea and Greene County deputies fanned out around the downtown Snow Hill area in the hours following the robbery, questioning business owners and pedestrians.

Samuel Edmonds, owner of Sam’s Barber Shop, was among those questioned. He told The Free Press that a black male who matched the description provided by law enforcement had walked by his shop around 11 a.m.

“He looked in the window; I thought maybe he was trying to get a haircut,”he said of the suspect.

The town’s police department, which was reinstated this year after being defunct since the mid-1990s, currently only consists of one officer, Rea, but town officials expect to add more officers in the coming months.

“Once they get that police department (fully staffed), that should be their main focus, burglary and domestic violence,”Edmonds said.
