 Suspects arrested in Utah murders, Nev. shooting

 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A pair of suspects was arrested in Nevada on Tuesday in the killing of an elderly Utah couple and the shooting of a woman outside a Nevada casino, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Jim Phelps said.

 Phelps told The Associated Press that Logan Welles McFarland, 24, and Angela Atwood were found Tuesday afternoon walking in a desolate area near Interstate 80 about 35 miles west of the Utah border, not far from where they ditched police in a high-speed chase on Saturday. 

 Phelps said the couple didn&apos;t resist and were taken into custody as suspects in both the killings and the shooting of a woman during a botched carjacking in Nevada. 

 The couple had abandoned their car and weapons when federal marshals, Elko County sheriff&apos;s deputies and West Wendover police made the arrest at about 12:30 p.m. a few miles south of Oasis, Nev., said Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Jim Stewart 

 The arrest was &quot;pretty calm,&quot; Stewart recounted, adding that the suspects said, &quot;&apos;We give up.&apos;&quot; 

 Earlier Tuesday, authorities issued an arrest warrant for McFarland in the burglary of the Utah&apos;s couple&apos;s Mount Pleasant home. He has since been charged. 

 Neither suspect has been charged in the murders, carjacking or shooting of the West Wendover woman, who is recovering at a Salt Lake City hospital. 

 Federal marshals said they would drop a charge of unlawful flight to let state authorities take over the case. 

 The suspects&apos; stolen vehicle has not been found, and police believe it may have broken down in the mountains south of I-80. 

 Police said a witness told them McFarland bragged at a Friday night party about obtaining money and firearms. 

 The warrant filed in court Tuesday says McFarland and a woman left in a stolen car for West Wendover, Nev., where police say they shot and wounded a woman in the head during an attempted carjacking. 

 McFarland and Atwood were last seen in Nevada on Saturday driving a stolen gray Volkswagen Jetta with Colorado license plate 725WHX. They led police on a 50-mile chase at speeds up to 100 mph before turning off the interstate and fleeing into the hills. 

 Jewelry and other stolen items from the home of the Utah couple, LeRoy and Ann Fullwood, were found in the trunk of a car the suspects took from the Friday night party, police said. 

 The car was ditched about 45 miles away and a stolen Saturn sedan was allegedly used to drive to West Wendover. A receipt from a fast-food restaurant found in the car indicated the meal was paid for with LeRoy Fullwood&apos;s stolen credit card. 

 The Jetta was then stolen in a motel parking lot.
