 It&apos;s truly a question that you can answer through just giving it a try. However, if you find that the retainer is affecting necessary airflow to adequately play your instrument then simply remove it while practicing or playing. A couple of things to consider. Retainers must be in place for at least 6 hours daily or shifting will occur and ultimately the retainer will not fit and you may be looking at additional costs to correct the problem. Not to mention many retainers are frequently lost and can be a challenge to keep up with. Many patients remove their appliance while say eating at a fast food restaurant. They put it on their tray and ultimately it ends up in the trash. Replacements can run about $300. Also for some reason dogs love to use them as chew toys so if you have dogs inside, keep the retainer out of site and reach. Personally I prefer fixed retainers. They are thin wires that are bonded on the insides of the front teeth (most commonly the lower anterior teeth). They can be a challenge to keep clean but it is a more reliable way to more effectively prevent shifting of your nice straight teeth that you invested a substantial amount of money to get them that way.

 Of course it is possible for you to learn a musical instrument. But I will suggest you do not choose a wind instrument as the retainer will inevitably affect the grip and the position of your mouth shape with the mouth pieces of the wind instrument. I have friends who struggle with getting consistency of tone with their retainers. Yes it is possible to play and make sound, but I suspect it will be difficult for them to play as well as someone who does not have that additional obstacle. Having said that, if you have the will and guidance from a good teacher, you might overcome the difficulties!
