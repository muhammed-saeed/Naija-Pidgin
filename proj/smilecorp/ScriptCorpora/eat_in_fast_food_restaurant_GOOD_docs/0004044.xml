Avenue clothing store in Rockford closed
 Posted on February 15, 2011 at 1:59 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
The Avenue clothing store, which carries plus-size women’s clothing and accessories, has closed its doors at the Forest Plaza shopping center in Rockford.

I had reached out to the company a few weeks ago, but no one responded to my inquiries about the closing. The store is no longer listed on Avenue’s website, and the store phone number is disconnected.

 

Shoppers will notice some other changes at Forest Plaza this year. Old Navy and Shoe Carnival are moving from their current locations by Target into the shopping center, which is located near Mulford Road and East State Street. Teen and pre-teen retailer Five Below is also opening at the center.

 Update: Les Morris, a spokesman for Simon Property Group, said officials are trying to relocate the Avenue store within Forest Plaza. Simon owns the shopping center. Five Below, a teen and pre-teen retailer, is moving into the old Avenue and Disc Replay spaces. Disc Replay is also being relocated within Forest Plaza.

 Another update: Sounds like the Avenue store might not reopen in Rockford, according to Redcats, the Avenue’s parent company. Karen Davis, corporate communications manager for Redcats, said Avenue left Rockford because its lease expired. She said,“at this time, we do not know if we will be returning to the Rockford area.”She said the company hopes that customers continue shopping at Avenue’s website and she noted that there is an Avenue store in Schaumburg.
