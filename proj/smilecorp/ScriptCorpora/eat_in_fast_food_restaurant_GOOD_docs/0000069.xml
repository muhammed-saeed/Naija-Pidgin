 Is healthy food really more expensive?

Contrary to popular belief, it can actually cost more to eat badly. In fact, a new government report finds that nutritious foods–such as grains, vegetables, fruit and dairy–typically cost less than items high in saturated fat and added sugars.

Researchers from the USDA compared the prices of 4,439“healthy”and“less healthy”foods commonly available in supermarkets around the country, examining price of edible weight, price per average portion, and price per calorie.

It can be cheaper to eat a healthier cereal than a more sugary one.
 
When price of edible weight or price per portion were used to determine costs, the researchers found healthy foods like toasted oat cereal (a grain), vegetables, fruits, and low-fat milk and plain, low-fat yogurt (dairy) were more affordable than most protein foods (lean roast beef, chicken breast, or canned tuna ) and other less healthful‘moderation foods’—foods that typically pack in an excess amount of saturated fat, added sugar, and/or sodium.

Examples of moderation foods include ice cream sandwiches, low-fat fruit flavored yogurt, and macaroni and cheese. When another measure—price per calorie—was used to compare foods, many healthful fruits and vegetables cost more than less healthy‘moderation foods’—especially those high in saturated fat and/or added sugars (such as chocolate candy, ice cream and tortilla chips ).

Although previous studies that used price-per-calorie to measure food costs similarly suggested healthy foods were often more expensive than less healthy options, a 2011 study by the USDA that used price of edible weight found that, although whole grains cost more than refined grains, and fresh and frozen dark green vegetables cost more than starchy vegetables, healthful items such as skim and 1 percent milk were less expensive than whole and two percent milk. Bottled water also tended to be less costly than carbonated nonalcoholic drinks.

In the current study, researchers used the USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion Food Prices Database to estimate costs and compare all food items included.

Comparing the cost of commonly available foods is important because, at a time when two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese and many low-income families struggle to control their grocery bills, the belief that healthier foods are always pricier adds to the problem. According The NPD group, a market research firm, it’s no surprise that Americans come close to following federal dietary guidelines on only seven days per year. Although many variables—personal preferences, convenience, and cultural factors—play a role in what we buy at the supermarket, cost may play an even greater role in our food choices.

“It’s a common perception that healthy foods are more expensive than less healthy foods—and this perception, real or hypothetical, may prevent many individuals from choosing healthy foods,”says David Katz, MD, Director, Yale University Prevention Research Center. 

So what’s a family to do to consume a more healthful and affordable diet?

Judy Caplan, R.D., a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, suggests the following:

 Plan meals ahead of time to cut down on food costs and reduce impulse buying. When you cook, make extra and freeze leftovers in individual portions. That can minimize waste and give you an alternative to grabbing take-out or convenience food. Since protein foods such as meat and poultry can be expensive, use them more as a condiment than a main course. You can also replace some or all of the meat or poultry used in chilis and stews with beans. Eat more‘south of the border’meals like whole grain tortillas with beans, cheese, and salsa. Choosing healthy fats like avocado (used to make guacamole) can also promote satiety and help you feel full longer. To trim produce costs, buy fruits and vegetables that are in season. You can save even more money if you plant your own backyard garden using seed packets. Plant the five vegetables your family eats most often. Continuous plantings throughout the summer will insure a steady supply. If you don&apos;t have a backyard, container gardening is another option.

 5 ways to be healthier by Friday 
 
 By April Hussar 
 SELF.com 

Happy National Women&apos;s  Health  Week, ladies! This week is all about YOU -- and we have all the advice you need to make the most of it and end the  work  week healthier than when you started.

National Women&apos;s Health Week, now in its 13th year, is a week-long health observance coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&apos; Office on Women&apos;s Health. Dedicated to empowering women to make health a top priority, this year&apos;s theme is, &quot;It&apos;s Your Time.&quot; 

&quot;Healthy, strong women are essential to having healthy strong children and communities, but too often women place the needs of others before their own needs,&quot; says U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Here are 5 ways to put YOURSELF first this week by improving your physical and mental health and lowering your risks of certain diseases:

 1. Visit a health care professional to receive regular checkups and preventive screenings.  Monday, May 14 was National Women&apos;s Checkup Day. Now, you already know you should be getting a yearly checkup from your general practitioner, and keeping your annual gyn appointment (right?), but don&apos;t forget about your teeth , your skin and your eyes! Most health care insurance plans cover a dermatologist checkup, something to take advantage of, considering that between 1970 and 2009, melanoma increased eightfold among young women and fourfold among young men ages 18 to 39, according to a new study from the Mayo Clinic. And if you need to get your teeth cleaned but are worried about the costs, here are  SELF&apos;s three ways to lower your dental bills .

 2. Get active.  You might say &quot;no duh&quot; to this one, but remember that getting active doesn&apos;t have to mean working out at the gym or going for a run (though those are super healthy ideas, of course!). The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has a great idea for a fun way to burn 100 calories in 20 minutes -- wash your car by hand! You&apos;ll get some fresh air and save some money, and it&apos;s a fun excuse to put on some cut-offs and splash your cute neighbor with some suds! For 58 (yes, 58) more fun ways to burn 100 calories,  check out SELF&apos;s slideshow of fun suggestions. 

 3. Eat healthy.  Another no-brainer, but sometimes it just seems &quot;easier&quot; to grab a slice of pizza on the go or swing through a drive-through on your way to work. We&apos;ve got you covered!  Here are 8 &quot;no-excuses&quot; grab-and-go breakfast ideas , and for tasty, easy and healthy dinner recipes, check out  SELF&apos;s 14 Quick Weeknight Meals. 

 4. Pay attention to your mental health, including getting enough sleep and managing stress.  Fitness doesn&apos;t stop at the banishment of your muffin top. One surefire way of improving your beauty sleep is to banish technology from your bedroom. Desktop computers, iPhones, BlackBerries ... Joseph M. Ojile, MD, board member of the National Sleep Foundation and founder and CEO of Clayton Sleep Institute in St Louis, MO, says they&apos;re all &quot;extremely disruptive&quot; -- from the bright light of the screen to the cognitive distraction of wanting to reply to emails or texts. Getting a truly good night&apos;s sleep goes a long way to helping you feel good -- in body and mind. 

And if you need more ways to combat stress,  SELF has 19 of them here (from dining by candlelight to brightening up your desk) .

 5. Avoid unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and not wearing a seatbelt or bicycle helmet.  What if for one week, you treated yourself with the care you&apos;d give to your own kid? Buckle up, don&apos;t give in to a &quot;social smoke,&quot; wear your sunscreen and make all those smart decisions you&apos;d want your own daughter or best friend to make.

 Care to downsize that order? Many want smaller portions 
 
Care to downsize that cheeseburger order?
 By Linda Carroll 
What if the server at your favorite fast food joint asked if you wanted to downsize your order, instead of asking you to supersize it?

That’s a strategy that might make some patrons happier–and a lot thinner, a new study suggests.

When people were asked if they wanted to downsize portions of their side dishes at a fast food restaurant, as many as a third opted for the smaller–and thus lower calorie - option, according to the report published in the journal Health Affairs.

The whole notion seems counter to our natural bargain-hunting instincts: less food for the same price. But consumers apparently are ready to tighten their belts, literally.

“The restaurant thought people wouldn’t be willing to do it,&quot; said the study’s lead author, Janet Schwartz, a psychologist and an assistant professor of marketing at the Freeman School of Business at Tulane University.“Some people don’t want big supersized portions and they’re willing to pay a premium for it by paying the same amount for less food.”

Other strategies, like displaying the calorie count of every item on the fast food restaurant menu, just haven’t led to weight loss, Schwartz said.

The idea behind downsizing is that people really do understand that no matter what’s put on their plates, they’ll most likely devour every single morsel, Schwartz said. But, if they’re given a chance to get a smaller portion before they stick the first forkful into their mouths, many will go for it.

For the new study, Schwartz and her colleagues asked a fast food Chinese restaurant to offer customers smaller portions of high carb side dishes. In one experiment, people were given a small price incentive - a 25-cent savings–and in two others, they were simply offered a smaller portion at the same price.

When there was a cash discount, 33 percent of people chose the smaller portions, as compared to 21 percent and 18 percent without the monetary incentive. 

The savings in calories were significant–200 for those choosing the downsized option.

Leslie Bonci, a nutritionist at the University of Pittsburgh thinks this kind of strategy could help the nation shed some serious pounds.

Certainly the addition of calorie counts didn’t.

“There’s a certain number numbness out there,”said Bonci, director of sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

A big part of the problem is the growth of the portion size, Bonci said. It’s changed our expectations.

“There was a time when the piece of meat on our plate would be 6 ounces,”Bonci explained.“Now, depending on where you go, it can be anywhere from 9 to 12 ounces–and more if you get a steak. A serving of pasta used to be a cup, now it’s 3 at a minimum and often up to 6.

“Meanwhile, vegetables have taken a nose-dive. You used to get five chunks of broccoli on your plate, now it’s just one sad little spear. There’s been a total reversal of what’s being put on our plates and our eyes have gotten used to it.”

Still, Bonci said, calling it“downsizing,”might not be the best strategy if you want it to appeal to hungry diners.“Downsizing has such a negative connotation,”she explained.“People are going to think,‘I don’t want to lose my food!”

“Instead of asking,‘would you like to add some fries,’servers could ask,‘would you like to right-size it,’”Bonci suggested.

If you’re trying to figure out how to implement the“right-size”strategy at your favorite fast food joint, Bonci suggests simply ordering the smallest size of everything–and not ordering anything bigger than the size of your fist.

“So, if you do a single burger or a junior burger and a small fries then you’re really getting out of there unscathed in terms of your calorie cap,”Bonci said.“And make sure you choose a small drink, too. Or better yet, ask for a cup with ice and fill it with water.”

Bonci underscores the importance of carefully monitoring your liguid calories.“If you order a small burger and a small fries and add to that a tank sized soda you can triple the calories of your meal,”she said.

If you’re going to allow yourself a desert, like ice cream, ask for the kiddie cone, Bonci suggests.

In regular restaurants consider ordering appetizers instead of the full entre, or asking if they offer a half size portion, Bonci suggests.

 The problem is a small soda these days is 16-20 ounces. I can remember when a small soda was only 8-12 ounces. That is where you really pile on the calories, drinking all that sugar water soda.

 McNugget addict collapses; experts warn of high-salt diet 
 
 Prevention 

Even if you’ve never had a McNugget, you could be guilty of eating a high sodium diet.

Imagine eating nothing but salt-filled McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets. For 15 years . That’s exactly what Stacey Irvine, a 17-year-old factory worker from England did—and it just may kill her. But before you write this story off as just plain crazy, do you know how much salt you’re taking in? And what it’s doing to your health?

As reported by the Daily Mail , when Stacey Irvine’s mother first took her to a McDonald’s restaurant 15 years ago and bought her some Chicken McNuggets, it was love at first bite. Since then, the British teen has eaten almost nothing but Chicken McNuggets. A diet like this not only lacks vital nutrients, it also serves up a dangerous amount of salt. A 10-piece order of Chicken McNuggets packs in 900 milligrams (mg) of sodium, more than half the sodium you should have in a single day.
 
A McDonald&apos;s Chicken McNuggets every now and then won&apos;t hurt you. But a 10-piece order packs in more than half the sodium you should have in a single day.
 
Irvine recently collapsed at work, and was rushed to the hospital struggling to breathe. She’s home now, but the amount of salt she’s been eating means she’ll need to clean up her diet faster than a McDonald’s employee turns around an order at the drive thru window. All that salt can lead to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly as she ages.

 13 ways to lower blood pressure naturally 

“The food industry creates a preference for very salty foods with the high salt content of their products, then creates products to satisfy that preference, and it becomes a feedback loop,”says David Katz, MD, founding director of Yale University&apos;s Prevention Research Center.

While most people aren’t surprised to hear that a high-sodium diet raises blood pressure, most Americans would be downright shocked if they knew how much salt they really eat. The US government recommends that adults should consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium a day, about two-thirds of a teaspoon. The average American really takes in 3,436 mg a day—more than double the recommendation.

 5 ditch-the-salt dinners 

Before you reassure yourself that you’re fine—after all, you banned the salt shaker from your table long ago—it turns out the biggest culprits are processed and packaged foods. &quot; The vast majority of salt, 80% or more, is already in processed and pre-prepared foods,&quot; says Marion Nestle, PhD, professor of nutrition at New York University.

Here’s just how fast the salt can add up on a typical day:

 Breakfast: 1 whole grain bagel (490 mg) with 2 Tbsp fat-free cream cheese (211 mg) and 6 oz yogurt (95 mg)

 Snack: 2 Tbsp peanut butter (147 mg) on 6 wheat crackers (194 mg)

 Lunch: Sandwich with 2 slices low-salt turkey (432 mg), 1 slice American cheese (266 mg), and 2 tsp mustard (114 mg) in a flour tortilla (490 mg) with 1 dill pickle spear (306 mg) and 1c vegetable soup (960 mg)

 Snack: 1 wheat pita (340 mg) with 2 Tbsp hummus (114 mg)

 Dinner: ½c pasta (4 mg) with½c jarred tomato sauce (480 mg) and 2 meatballs (232 mg), 1 slice garlic bread (400 mg), and salad with reduced fat ranch dressing (336 mg)

 Dessert: Homemade apple crisp (495 mg) with½c vanilla ice cream (53 mg) and 2 Tbsp caramel sauce (60 mg)

 The grand total: 6,219 mg, more than quadruple the daily recommended amount.

So even if you’ve never touched a McNugget, you can still quickly eat more sodium than you should. And all that salt doesn’t only hurt your heart and your waistline. An emerging body of research has also linked excessive sodium intake to cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, dementia, sleep apnea, and kidney disease.

 25 ridiculously healthy foods 

Scary stuff. But what’s even scarier is that it’s not easy to kick the salt habit: Chances are, you’re addicted to the stuff. Your body only needs about 500 mg of sodium a day to maintain the right balance of fluids, transmit nerve impulses, and move your muscles. When you eat far more than that—as most of us clearly do—your brain chemistry is altered. Research shows that salt actually triggers the release of the feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine, which makes salty foods as addictive as nicotine and alcohol.

And just like with any addiction, eating salty foods makes your body crave more. In other words, the more Chicken McNuggets you have, the more you crave them. No matter what the cost.

 Some kids&apos; cereals pack more sugar than a Twinkie 
 
With 20 grams of sugar per one-cup serving, Kellogg&apos;s Honey Smacks has more sugar than a Twinkies snack cake, which has 18 grams of sugar.
 By Madelyn Fernstrom, TODAY diet and nutrition editor 
Breakfast is a healthy start to everyone’s day, and it’s especially important for children and their school performance. Nothing could be easier than a bowl of cold cereal and milk. While we’re all aware that some popular cereals contain whopping amounts of sugar, a new report by the Environmental Working Group reviewed 84 popular brands, and revealed some eye-popping comparisons of the sugar content with some popular cookies and snack cakes.

At nearly 56 percent sugar by weight, three cereals (Kellogg’s Honey Smacks, Post Golden Crisp, and General Mills Wheaties Fuel) weigh in with 20 grams of sugar in a skimpy one cup serving. That’s a whopping five teaspoons of sugar—roughly the same as one Twinkie snack cake. And with today&apos;s oversized cereal bowls, a typical serving size is likely to be double that amount, or closer to two cups.

A single one-cup bowl of an additional 44 cereals, including the popular Honey Nut Cheerios, Apple Jacks and Cap’n Crunch, are equivalent to eating three Chips Ahoy cookies—about three teaspoons of sugar.

While the sugar content of these popular cereals is unlikely to change anytime soon, there are a lot of tasty lower sugar options to choose from. These include Kellogg’s Mini-Wheats (frosted or unfrosted), General Mills’original Cheerios and Kix, Post Shredded Wheat (all varieties), and Quaker Oats Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares. I’ve also got some easy ways to include some of your child’s favorites without a sugar overload.

 Read back package labels (not the front!): Don’t be fooled by the front of the box nutrition claims. Look at the nutrition panel on the back, and make your own decision. Grams of sugar per serving doesn’t connect with most people, so translate this into teaspoons of sugar by dividing the sugar grams on the label by four. A cereal with 20 grams of sugar contains 5 teaspoons of sugar. And skip the“good source of whole grains”on the front; instead, look for three grams of fiber per serving, found on the back.

 Cut the sugar in half by mixing with low-sugar cereals: Many brands of cereals contain a low-sugar“basic”with higher-sugar product. Mix original Cheerios in equal parts with Honey-Nut Cheerios, and cut the sugar by 50 percent. This works for any high/low combination of cereals.

 Add some fresh, frozen or dried fruit to low-sugar cereals: Boost the nutrients and provide nature’s sweetness by adding fruit to a low-sugar cereal. For pricey berries, try frozen bagged fruits like blueberries, or strawberries, two kid-friendly options.

 Use the high sugar cereals as a dessert: Portion out a single serving (about 1 cup) in a small bag for your child to enjoy as a treat or dessert, instead of a cookie or other treat.

 And remember to choose low fat or non-fat milk, or soy milk (if there is a health reason for excluding dairy). These are calcium- and vitamin D-rich options—important for kids of all ages.

 10 WORST CHILDREN&apos;S CEREALS
 (Based on percent sugar by weight)

1. Kellog&apos;s Honey Smacks

2. Post Golden Crisp

3. Kellogg&apos;s Froot Loops Marshmallows

4. Quaker Oats Cap&apos;n Crunch&apos;s OOPS! All Berries

5. Quaker Oats Cap&apos;n Crunch Original

6. Quaker Oats Oh!s

7. Kellogg&apos;s Smorz

8. Kellogg&apos;s Apple Jacks

9. Quaker Oats Cap&apos;n Crunch&apos;s Crunch Berries

10. Kellogg&apos;s Froot Loops Original

 Have you really done ALL your research. I buy General Mills Cereals because of all the reductions they have made in sugar. Yet, you list Wheaties Fuel among the top &quot;Children&apos;s Cereals&quot; with the highest sugar.
