Men Over 40? How To Be Desirable To Women Of All Ages? Even Young Women.

A Little Gray Hair Can Be A Great Feature If You Play It Right
 Enough with the whining. When we pass &quot;middle age&quot; our mental outlook on life can lose a good deal of its vitality. Our penchant for playful and spontaneous experiences... the desire for learning and growth... the sheer hunger for adventure and new things... These things which bubble up naturally when we are younger, can fade and virtually disappear if we do not recognize them, value them and nurture their continuance as we age. If you can find a way to meld the confident calm and experience that you have gained over the years, while still managing to exude an appropriate degree of boyish energy and curiosity, you will have achieved the recipe for unprecedented appeal to women of all ages .

Easier said than done of course. Then again, most things worth having usually are. So, what is the recipe that will make you an irresistable dish on every woman&apos;s menu? Lets consider a few vital ingredients. What I am about to say is especially applicable to older men... But, the principles are vital for all men no matter what age. So listen up!

 Don&apos;t Let Your Tastes Get Stale 
Now don&apos;t get all defensive. (We will address getting defensive later.) I am not saying you have to change your tastes or even to try hard to like something you don&apos;t. What I am saying is, don&apos;t try hard not to like something simply because you haven&apos;t in the past.

This would include a wide range of things. The idea is to continue growing. Do you try really listening to newer music? When was the last time you tried a new restaurant? A new watering hole? A new style of pants? A new cologne? A new hobby or interest?

The real question is, why did you stop trying new things? And what prevents you from exploring something new now? Comfort and tradition are great luxuries that all of us can appreciate. But, when routine and comfort replaces growth, stagnation is always a danger.

Honestly, you don&apos;t need to be on the cutting edge of anything to be desirable. But, men who are complacent about such things, and who are&quot;set in their ways&quot;, had better be prepared to be viewed as stodgy, stale, and unexciting. (And not only by younger women. Modern women of maturity are generally more receptive to their male contemporaries who are energetic and progressive.)

 Don&apos;t Neglect Yourself 
As we age, our bodies become higher maintenance. Let&apos;s face it, even a Mercedes will rust if it isn&apos;t cared for properly. It is important that men understand the changes that are occurring with their bodies as they age and then accept the additional maintenance required to ensure that they are viewed as a sexy classic, rather than an overpriced&quot;used car&quot;.

What am I talking about? Okay, let me be plain... Body hair, teeth, skin, and muscle tone. Let&apos;s look at them one at a time.

 Body Hair 
It just never seems to quit. It gets thicker and coarser. And it just seems to sprout from the most unexpected places. Hey, au naturale is the easiest and most time efficient approach. It is also the one that the lonely guys seem to embrace most often. Don&apos;t let it happen to you. Get a trimmer. (A GOOD ONE!) Keep the weeds trimmed! Erin and I call it&quot;Man Grooming&quot;. That includes ear hair, nose hair, wild hairs on your face and a tasteful amount of thinning on the chest, back (you animal) and other more private areas. (Here is a sexy variant. Get her to join in the enterprise. Mutual grooming is intimate and super sexy.)

We are not talking shaving or waxing here. Most women find neatly groomed and trimmed hair to be masculine and exciting. Through experimentation you will find a length that suits you and her.

 Teeth 
Women will never excuse bad teeth. Why should they? Dental maintenance and hygiene is a must. All I can say on this is, go to a dentist and fix what is not right. There is no way around this. If your teeth are decaying or your breath is bad, you are sunk in every real sense of the word when it comes to women.

Ask someone you trust and are comfortable with. If they even hesitate in telling you that you do not have an issue, you will want to ponder this. If you are grossly negligent in caring for your teeth, there is very little need to bother with the other advice on this lens until it is cared for.

 Skin 
I am sure that I am generalizing, but, somewhere along the timeline of every man&apos;s life, I believe he is led to believe that attention to skin care is not manly. I am not sure exactly why we as a gender decided to utterly abandon ourselves to the ravages of the sun and our thinning ozone layer. But, in general, men are not very protective of their complexions.

Okay, I know I will have to work to make this point. But, in the end, it is not you, but rather your woman, (and your dermatologist) that will appreciate what I am about to say.

The sun is sculpting your face and it is winning! Women are assessing your age to a large degree by your face and the wrinkles, spots, and texture that it manifests. Now, I have already said that a weathered look in itself is not a detriment for a man with the right outlook on life and love. Heck, Erin will tell you that the sexiest men in Hollywood are the&quot;post 007&quot;Sean Connery, and Oliver Reed, better known as&quot;Bill Sikes&quot;in Oliver, but she says he is sexiest as&quot;Proximo&quot;in the movie Gladiator. Huh? Go figure. However, women appreciate men who know how to care for themselves. Follow me on this...

Women care for their faces by using sunblocks, moisturizers, and exfollients. They feel it is important to do these things since it makes them look younger and is a demonstration that they care about how they look as they too age.

What about you man? Ready to let yourself go? I think not. I cannot say that a women will intuitively know that you are using a facial scrub or a facial moisterizer that includes a sunblock. But, I will tell you this. If you are fortunate enough to have her find it either by casually perusing your medicine cabinet, or in casual conversation, she will view it as a sign that you are concerned about your looks. She will also realize instantly that you are not a man that is slave to convention or the stale sensitivities our parents ignorantly passed on to us as children.

So here&apos;s the skinny. Exfolliate a couple times a week while in the shower. And every morning apply a moisturizer with at least rating of at least SPF 20. It took me a few weeks to see and feel a noticable differance. So be patient.

 Muscle Tone 
Okay gentlemen. Here we are at the root of the matter. Gravity, in the context of this topic, is our enemy. Now, if you think about it for a few moments, you will realize that my statement is a relative one. Many of the best parts of life are ultimately dependent on the effects of gravity. Things like football, golf, fishing, or even drinking a beer get real challenging without it. However, aging coupled with gravity results in a very real struggle for any man wishing to remain desirable to women.

What&apos;s the remedy? Ultimately, there is no perfect answer. Part of it is in accepting the inevitable effects of gravity and playing them as signs of experience and possible stability. The other is realizing that if we get into a pattern of inactivity, we are merely sleeping with the enemy.

There is currently only one way known to resist the enemy. Gravity hates toning. Toning comes from exercise and motion against resistance. I am not talking about bulking up. Large muscles are very attractive and I wish I had them. However, you and I are well passed that stage. Here I am talking about activity. Activity = walking, running, stairstepping, hiking, etc. JUST KEEP MOVING!

I have a job that is primarily mental. That has led to a challenge for me. I am constantly looking for ways to increase the physical nature of my daily routine. You would do well to do the same. So walk up the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Park in the spot furthest from your destination. Pick up the trash can and carry it instead of using those cute little rollers that it came with. Use it or lose it man.

 Don&apos;t Be Defensive 

Let&apos;s face it, sometimes when you have lived a few decades your experiences seem to carve some very deep grooves in your mind and personality. There is alot to be said for the wisdom and confidence you achieve later in life. It can be a very attractive quality when you exhibit strength of character. But it is a double edge sword that has smote more than one romance. Confidence without humility breeds inflexibility and closemindedness and women of substance will not tolerate either. But do not worry, there is a way to meet eye to eye with any woman, of any age. It&apos;s all in not being defensive.

What does that mean exactly? It means when a woman makes a comment, it is not time to go into defense mode trying to defend what we&quot;think&quot;we know or to try to persuade her to believe what we DO know. It means being open-minded enough to listen to her point of view and at least admit that she may have a different point of view or have experienced things differently than we have. Seriously? She may even at times be RIGHT in what she is saying.

This means admitting to ourselves that the way we perceive things may not always be&quot;right&quot;and that another&apos;s person&apos;s view on things may indeed be&quot;right&quot;in their own eyes. And in the end, you may want to re-evaluate how important it truly is to be&quot;right&quot;.

So how do you avoid being defensive? You simply LISTEN. Use your skills of reason and even if you do not agree with their point of view, resist the urge to immediately react adversely to her views or to engage in debate. Listen carefully to what she has to say and ask questions to find out how she may have come to her conclusions. This in turn may l Important! 
The Point Is...
 Age is largely irrelevant to your appeal to women. Most men become more attractive in personality and physical appearance in their later years, if they give attention to proper maintenance of their minds and bodies.
