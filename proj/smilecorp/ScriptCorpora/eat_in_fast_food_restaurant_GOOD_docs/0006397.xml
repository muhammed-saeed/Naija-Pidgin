 July 3, 2012 Likes it Delicious lunch!! by Bella ( 1 review ) I tried Malia for lunch and I must say, I was genuinely impressed. Friendly staff, very comfortable place, beautifully decorated. I tried the Lamb Burger from the menu and it was so delicious. I LOVE that it was served with fresh fruit and these beautifully colored chips...they were fantastic! I watched many of the plates come from the kitchen and it was difficult to not ask to taste each one! I&apos;ve not dined in a restaurant where you could see the chefs cooking, I thought that was a fantastic idea. Absolutely delicious, I can&apos;t wait to come back! May 21, 2012 Likes it Malia: backstage pass by saucystella ( 1 review ) I recently ventured into Malia&apos;s this week to buy a gift card for my fathers birthday. I was pleasantly surprised to see what appeared to be a local farmer bringing in buckets of herbs and beautiful greens. Who knew that they WERE NOT buying such things from food suppliers? I considered myself lucky to see the&quot;backstage&quot;action that was taking place and what fresh ingredients would land on my plate in the near future. Malia&apos;s is one of my favorite places to dine and I love to see them working hand in hand with our local farmers. May 17, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Rhinestone Tiara by livinginthereelwhirled ( 1 review ) My partner and I have been to Malia on two prior occasions. I am not as taken by the restaurant as he. The food is fine if you want to wallow in animal fat. The service? My first impression is I had walked into a Brownie Troop meeting. Although knowledgeable on face value, it is obvious that their knowledge is by wrote and limited to the menu. The menu? Almost illegible. It took only a little flattery to get the waitress to come clean on the menu descriptions. “Wild mushrooms”, “Hand Cut Pasta”, Artisan Bread and Crackers” were the obvious. I am sure they don’t actually use all the cheeses they list either. I am sure these items are out of boxes and come from standard restaurant suppliers. The room was overbooked, tables too close together and NOISY! This is definitely not a place for an intimate dinner. It’s intimacy is on par with a mall food court (probably where the wait staff came from)The waitress kept pressing the wine list as if the food was a loss leader for their real profit maker. I am not from Battle Creek but it would seem the downtown is dead or dying and Malia, rather than being in oasis in a ghost town is more like a rhinestone tiara on a crack whore. 1 out of 4 found this review helpful April 18, 2012 Likes it WOW!!! by Kathie ( 8 reviews ) This was my first time visiting Malia and I can&apos;t wait to go back! I was celebrating a birthday lunch with a friend and decided to try someplace new. The restaurant was nicely decorated (still had&quot;old store front charm, wooden floors) tables are not too close and the service was great. We both had the mushroom soup and it was delicious. For our lunch entree we both had one of the specials.... swordfish. This was served open face with Havarti cheese, house made root chips and perfectly ripe fresh fruit. We ended our meal sharing a piece of chocolate cake with vanilla bean frosting. It was unbelievably moist and the perfect finish to a wonderful lunch. The only&quot;catch&quot;that will keep this restaurant an option for only very special occasions is the price. $73.00 for lunch ($61 lunch with $12 tip). I know the selections on the menu are&quot;upscale&quot;but maybe an option of a few $8-$10 items for lunch would get me back more often. I give them an A+ :) January 26, 2012 Really likes it INSANELY DELICIOUS!! by Emily ( 1 review ) Easily the most delicious restaurant in southwest Michigan, Malia is a true gem and our hands-down favorite!! Consistently superb food with amazing taste. Desserts to die for and they are made fresh daily!! I also found out that their bread is made in-house...is there nothing that these culinary magicians can&apos;t do?? The chef told us that their seafood is caught fresh from the water and flown to their door within 24 hours-you really can&apos;t beat it! The waitstaff is SOO friendly and it feels like home, so warm, so cozy and comfortable. 3 out of 3 found this review helpful January 28, 2012 Likes it Celebrating Family at Malia! by Renee Hudson Allen ( 1 review ) Just had the most delicious dinner ever tonight with my 3 favorite guys...celebrating family! The chicken tortellini was scrumptious and the german chocolate cake to die for! :) And my son was soooo happy to take home an (empty) Cane Cola bottle as a souvenier! Thanks to Chef Samson and his outstanding crew and our fabulous waitress Trish for a wonderful evening! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful December 9, 2011 Likes it Great Food! by Mike ( 1 review ) Never had a bad meal here! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful January 16, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Trying to be too many things in too small of a space. by Susan Bennett ( 4 reviews ) I was immediately put off by the fact that most people come to the front door and no direction is given....you have to go to the back and check in with a busy waiter. We saw people stand at the front door all night waiting for direction. You&apos;d think the waiters would finally say,&quot;Good evening...you might want to move to the back to be seated&quot;, but nothing. I tried to check in but was asked to wait a minute. There are empty tables in the back with no seats where everyone was standing, so I assumed that since she had brought over wine to a group that she would come, offer me a drink and check the reservation. I was wrong. After 25 minutes, I went back to the counter, waited in line a second time and finally found out about the reservation.

She was nice enough to offer me a complimentary glass of wine while I continued to wait. After our group was seated I started to notice several things that were very off putting...the tables were too big for the amount of space available. We had two tables for four pushed together for our group of 5; everyone bumped in to my chair or the chair behind me because we were too close together. The two in our group that set next to the wall were literally wedged between the wall and the table with no room to move. No table cloths...I guess they were going for a clean look.....but it looks more like a fast food restaurant. Finally, the wait staff wears jeans. If I&apos;m paying $30 for a steak and it&apos;s after 5 pm, you should be wearing black slacks. The decor is lovely; very modern but cozy....but the larger kitchen seemed to cut in to the seating space....so they should probably trim the number of people they herd in. For our 7:45 reservation, we finally received our bruschetta a little after 8:30....it was nothing special, but we were so hungry we had two plates. Later, the waitress offered us bread with olive oil because our meal was taking so long. When the food finally came, one plate at a time, it was after 9:00 pm. I had the Filet; which was medium rare as I asked for....and was fine. The gnocchi was a bland and had absolutely no reason to be. If you&apos;re not going to infuse some flavor, just give me potatoes as a side. The mushroom sauce it was served with was very nice, but the flavors never fused with the gnocchi......shouldn&apos;t they have met prior to being put on the plate? The waitress saw the dry pile of gnocchi stacked to the side with the sauce and filet gone.....she actually asked if I wanted to take it with me. She should have asked if something was wrong with it. Obviously it wasn&apos;t good; two of us at the same table both left it untouched. Some at our table asked for dessert; so I asked for a coffee. My coffee came out much later than the desserts, so I&apos;m not certain that they understand that it&apos;s perfectly acceptable to put two desserts and a coffee on the same tray when bringing it out. Come to think of it, I don&apos;t recall seeing trays....that might help cut down on frustration and get meals out faster. 10:15....the check finally came....with my complimentary glass of wine on it. At that point, I knew I&apos;d never be back and I just wanted out of there. I paid it and left. I won&apos;t be back. I understand if they are not use to the volume of people...it won&apos;t last with that level of service and overpriced mediocre food. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful October 12, 2011 Really likes it Mobile review by Ccl ( 1 review ) The cream of mushroom soup&amp;lobster ravioli are decedent.

Malia is really the only place I will dine (seriously, ask my co-workers). They use local produce and products and feature them in dishes on their chalkboard so the ingredients are always fresh and bursting with flavor. Their unique combinations and love for food is prevalent in their dishes. I&apos;ve had so many fabulous meals...the lobster ravioli, the filet, the wild clam tortellini, the spicy crawfish linguini, the tuna sandwich, the lamb feta burger, their flatbreads...all have been superbly flavored, served piping hot and each bite was a delight for the tongue. The textures, the flavors, the smell...unmatched deliciousness. The great thing is that if there is something in the dish that you don&apos;t like, would like to substitute or just add, they are MORE than willing to create the dish as you would like. All you have to do is ask. Chef Samson&apos;s food knowledge is amazing and I think he could write a nutrition book that would knock your socks off but I&apos;m straying. Bottom line: they love food and it shows. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful May 23, 2011 Likes it Malia&apos;s is an all around great experience! by tinkerinks ( 2 reviews ) Greatness has come to downtown Battle Creek, Michigan. Recommendations: Make a reservation; it&apos;s worth planning out your night on the town with Malia&apos;s being part of the main course. For starters, the bruschetta and zuppa: Malia&apos;s Mushroom. We love the fact that you can change the style of noodles with any dish. The Linguini Carbonara (Tortellini Carbonara, on the menu), Lobster Ravioli and Chicken Marsala, hit the top three on my list. But, everything that we have tried there is amazing, especially with everything fresh like the vegetables and herbs, grown local. This is a family friendly atmosphere; we have even ordered to go for luncheon events. The service was top notch, they met me at the door and everything packed ready to go and hot!! www.maliafoods.com check out their menus and information today, you won&apos;t regret your experience with Jeff Samson and the staff at Malia&apos;s Mediterranean Bistro. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful January 15, 2011 Likes it Overall Nice Addition to Downtown Battle Creek by Grub &apos;n&apos; Brew in da Zoo ( 309 reviews ) NOTE: This review is a little long and is going to come off as significantly more critical than it really is.

When I took a peek at the menu, I decided this was right up my alley and added it to the top of the list of places to try. Getting a Table: Although it was at the top of my list of places to try, we had had dinner plans with friends at Rustica in Kalamazoo that were canceled at the last minute; so, I didn&apos;t have a chance to even try to make a reservation at Malia until the morning of the day we were going to be there. Predictably, they were booked solid, but I was told that they try to keep about 1/2 the house open for walk-ins, so I should come down anyway if I didn&apos;t mind waiting a bit. We called on our way over to put in our name and phone number so they could call when a table freed up (a nice touch employed by a number of downtown Kalamazoo restaurants these days, Rustica and Fandango included). When we called, the hostess sounded a bit like they were so booked up we might never get in, but we took the chance anyway. When we got into town, we poked our heads in to try to gauge the wait, and to our pleasant surprise, we were told she had a table for us that was just finishing dessert and it shouldn&apos;t be more than 20 minutes. Since there&apos;s not much&quot;lobby room&quot;, she said she&apos;d call when it was ready, and we headed next door for a drink. An hour later (I&apos;m a patient guy when I&apos;m a walk-in at a busy restaurant who&apos;s reservation book is full), I came back to check on the status. I was told that she had tried to call, but&quot;no one answered&quot;(still not sure I believe that since as any good AT&amp;T customer with shaky reception would do, the first thing we did when we got next door was call my phone to make sure it rang -- it did). No matter, though, a table was just leaving. If we hadn&apos;t been told 20 minutes, I wouldn&apos;t have thought twice about it. All told, an hour and 1/2 wait as a walk-in at a busy restaurant is perfectly reasonable in my book. The Table&amp;Service Thereat: The table at which we were sat is along the breezeway to the back entrance in the back 1/2 of the restaurant (across from the&quot;bar&quot;and coat rack) -- the tables were clearly not part of the original dining room plan. Although not ideal, this too was to be expected given our status as non-reservationed patrons. Our sense of being positioned in&quot;The Overflow&quot;was heightened by the whoosh of cold air every time someone opened the rear door and the fact that the wait staff used the bar as essentially a server station (including not quiet discussion on their experiences with various of their patrons). Again, though, there are only a couple of these tables back there, and frankly, given that the alternative would&apos;ve been to continue waiting for a table to open up in the main dining area, I was very happy to have been seated. As for the service, it was prompt, attentive, and relatively well-informed. She struggled a little with the specials, but I got the sense that they may have changed over the course of the evening as they ran out. In any event, the table wasn&apos;t great (but it was a table, for which we were grateful), and the service was really very good. The Food on the Table: After having gotten off to a bit of a rocky (but, admittedly, self-induced) start, we were counting on the food to deliver, and subject to a few quibbles it did. Upon learning that they were&quot;out&quot;of the Cherve Crab Dip, we started with the Malia Crab Cakes and Bistro Trilogy (basically, an olive and cheese plate). The crab cakes were well-prepared and very good. The&quot;lemon garlic aioli&quot;was unfortunately so heavy on the dill, we weren&apos;t huge fans and found it curious that there was no mention of dill in the menu description. Nevertheless, the crab cakes themselves were outstanding by themselves, so the&quot;sauce issues&quot;weren&apos;t particularly relevant. We were also both very big fans of the Bistro Trilogy. The olive tapenade was freshly made and delicious. The roasted garlic compote had clearly been carefully prepared to cook nearly all the bite out of the garlic while keeping the cloves in one piece (a trick in itself); the result was full, unblemished garlic cloves swimming in olive oil that were deceptively sweet and delicious. The pear goat cheese was a little sweeter than I would&apos;ve liked, but the Mrs. loved it and, in my book, you can&apos;t really go wrong with any variation of goat cheese. If I had one gripe here, it would be the&quot;artisan bread&quot;which seemed a bit on the stale side (rather than that toasted/crisp crostini-type texture I was expecting). But, that&apos;s a very minor gripe. Altogether, the appetizers were outstanding. For my salad, I got the&quot;Caesar&quot;. Now, this is partially my fault for not reading the menu, but calling it a&quot;Caesar&quot;on the menu is a little misleading (although, it was also misspelled on the menu, which, looking back, may have been intentional). It was, basically, romaine lettuce, a super sweet creamy dressing w/ bit of bleu cheese in it which balanced the sweet pretty well, topped with blueberries and kumquats (notably missing were the croutons and parmesan described in the menu). Once I got past the fact that it wasn&apos;t even remotely close to a traditional Caesar salad, I loved it. Honestly, it was outstanding. It was just a bit of palate confusion at expecting a Caesar and getting a sweet, fruity salad. So, if you order it, expect a delicious salad, just not anything close to its namesake. For the mains, the Mrs. got the shrimp and penne special and she thought it was just&quot;o.k.&quot;; it was missing a key (described) ingredient -- wilted spinach -- and that sort of threw off the whole thing for her, since, without it, it was just shrimp, pasta sauce, and pasta. I, however, ordered off the regular menu and got the Cioppino which I enjoyed very, very much -- with one caveat. Cioppino is not a pasta dish. It doesn&apos;t have pasta in it. It&apos;s not supposed to have pasta in it. If you&apos;re going to put pasta in it, you shouldn&apos;t call it Cioppino and list it separately from the pastas. If you&apos;re going to put pasta in it, you have to put that in the menu description. As you may have guessed, the Cioppino was loaded with linguine (and capers which was another curious, yet undescribed, addition). Aside from that (which significantly change the character of what I was expecting), it was really very good. The broth was very tasty with a great bite to it; it was absolutely loaded with the usual suspects of shellfish; the shellfish was good for Michigan (expectations can&apos;t be real high when you&apos;re 1500 miles away from the nearest ocean); and the fish that was used (not sure what it was) was flaky and delicious. I&apos;d definitely get it again, only next time, I&apos;ll be expecting a seafood linguine/friutti de mare type thing (which I love in its own right) instead of cioppino. Conclusion: If I had one overarching criticism, it would be that four of the five menu items we ordered didn&apos;t really match up with the menu (the lemon-garlic aioli was really a dill sauce, the caesar salad was really a sweet/fruity salad, the special was missing the described wilted spinach, and the Cioppino had non-traditional, and yet not described, linguine and capers in it). I&apos;m all for creative takes on traditional dishes; but I&apos;m not a big fan of being blindsided by them. Despite this, however, we both enjoyed our meals quite a bit and are very happy to have a dining option like this in downtown Battle Creek. Is there room for improvement? Yes. Even still, it&apos;s the best meal I&apos;ve had in Battle Creek, and we&apos;ll definitely be back. October 18, 2011 Likes it World Class food - and I mean it! by Sheila Wood ( 1 review ) I have been privileged to travel all over the world and dine in local restaurants from Kathmandu to Paris, and I never thought I&apos;d say that Battle Creek has a world class restaurant. I don&apos;t mean to compare Malia&apos;s with restaurants with views to die for, stuffy and elegant wait staff, and haute cuisine that you judge on looks as well as taste, but I AM talking about AMAZING skill coming from the kitchen! They use fresh vegetables and fruit which they buy daily, seafood and meat likewise, and they create sauces and use seasonings that are pure perfection! I&apos;ve never tasted better. The chef/owner, Jeff Sampson, is gracious and food-focused. He has trained his wait staff to deliver service that is superior to any experience I&apos;ve had in Michigan, and that includes the wait staff at Nibi, the casino&apos;s five-star restaurant. Trust me...dining at Malia&apos;s is a treat, and lunch there is always a good choice as well. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful September 19, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Leslie ( 2 reviews ) Gosh I was happy to hear that Battle Creek again had a great restaurant located downtown. I live near the&quot;foodie city&quot;of Lexington, Ky so when I ordered the entree Prawn and Risotto I expected more than only one jumbo shrimp on top of a sticky pile of risotto. Doubt I&apos;ll eat there again nor will my&quot;guest&quot;who lives in BC. August 3, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mediterranean name misleading by Garrett Cosgrove ( 4 reviews ) The food was wonderful, I went for lunch, however after reviewing both menus I came to the conclusion most of it is Italian, the name is very misleading, and I&apos;ve had Italian many times in my life, I was expecting something exotic. I will say it arguably has the nicest decor in Battle Creek, and is both very professional and - for dinner - worthy of dressing well. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful January 20, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Victor ( 4 reviews ) I like the decor and service, but mostly I like the food.

Children seem to be okay but younger ones may not find something to suit their palate. While open with brick walls and no tablecloths, it was not noisy when full from which similar designs sometimes suffer. In our opinion and in a short time, Malia has become one of the top fine dining destinations in Battle Creek. May 6, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Sadly Disappointing by Tammie ( 3 reviews ) I was filled with great expectations and it was with much anticipation that I awaited the long over-due opening of Malia&apos;s in Battle Creek...only to be disappointed. :( My husband and I decided to dine on a Friday night shortly after the restaurant had opened for business. We did not have a reservation, and though there appeared to be tables available, we were seated in a narrow, hallway-like area next to the wine bar. It was very noisy, and busy, and other diners ended up standing right next to our table while waiting to be seated, which was slightly awkward. However, the staff was very friendly and pleasant and had fun with everyone that was waiting. We ordered a baked olive appetizer, the menu description was intriguing and had me salivating, but the dish itself was a total let down. We were brought bread and olive oil, which we could see the servers preparing from where we sat. The olive oil was the garden variety all purpose oil that is available at the local grocers... more» I was filled with great expectations and it was with much anticipation that I awaited the long over-due opening of Malia&apos;s in Battle Creek...only to be disappointed. :( My husband and I decided to dine on a Friday night shortly after the restaurant had opened for business.

I guess I mistakenly thought that an upscale Mediterranean Bistro would offer a regional olive oil that was not sold in bulk at Sam&apos;s Club. For the entree I had a salmon and risotto dish and my husband had a Mediterranean fish/seafood stew. The portions were beautiful, as was the plating, but both the salmon and the stew were over seasoned. The stew was so salty, that it was hard to believe it had come from a professional kitchen. The risotto was the best part of the meal. I am sad that the food was such a disaster. I would like to give Malia&apos;s another try and blame this experience on&quot;growing pains&quot;, but my husband says he absolutely will not go with me again. July 27, 2011 Great Local Restaurant by Charlie Morse ( 1 review ) Whenever I want a unique dinning experience in Battle Creek Maiia&apos;s always comes to mind. Food is always prepared fresh to order and I really like that about the restaurant. One night I ordered their Rum Raisin rice pudding and I have to say it was the best I&apos;ve ever eaten, just fantastic. I would highly recommend this restaurant and thankful they are here in Battle Creek, hopefully to stay.
