PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. 

The first edition of this book was published by my father, the late James Macfarlar 
in 1878 and, at the time of his death in October, 1885, he had prepared many of tJ 
chapters and collected some of the material for others for this second edition. By f( 
lowing the system of the work already completed, with the assistance of the gentlemi 
Trhose names appear throughout these pages, I have, after many delays, completed t 
edition. 

The whole book has been carefully revised and new lines and new notes added, 
that the Guide, proper, has been enlarged from 158 to 370 pages. The introducto: 
portion of the book has been changed only where necessary to conform its statements 
the views now held by geologists. The altitudes are a new and valuable feature of ti 
edition and the list is as complete as could be obtained. A few chapters were so pi 
pared by their authors that little work was needed before printing them, but in me 
instances the labor of collecting and arranging such a mass of material into a compa 
and harmonious form has been greater than would be imagined. Whatever defects ai 
mistakes are found in the book may be attributed to the loss of the one whose mind co 
ceived its plan, and who was peculiarly fitted for its preparation. 

To the contributors and my many advisors I owe a debt of gratitude that I cann 
express, but I know that they will feel rewarded if their work results in an increase 

interest in, and knowledge of, the noble science of geology.

THE OBJECTS AND USES OF THIS WORK. 



1. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT GEOLOGISTS. 

The United States are intersected by numerous railroads leading in all 
directions, and nearly every one has occasion more or less to travel on them for 
considerable distances. In these railway journeys no person who has the least 
power of observation can fail to notice the peculiarities in the scenery and the 
great variety in the formations of rock to be seen in the railway cuts and 
cropping out on the hillsides. If we always had a professor of geology for our 
traveling companion, we would be glad to learn from him what these various 
formations of rock are, what place they occupy in the series of strata that 
are visible on the earth&apos;s surface, and their mineral and other productions ; also at 
what other localities the same rocks occur, and whether they are entirely new to 
us or the same we have seen elsewhere. This work is a substitute for the supposed 
traveling professor of geology, giving hi a small space the names of the geological 
formations which occur along the lines of the railroads, and in another part of the 
book is to be found a plain but full description of each of them. There are also 
foot notes directing attention to interesting geological places and objects on&apos; the 
routes of the railroads. One object of the work is to teach persons not versed in 
geology something of this science during the tedious and unprofitable hours of 
traveling, without study, not as in a text book, but by pointing to the things 
themselves as seen at railway stations and through the windows of a railway car. 
t No person could be so stupid as to travel all over the United States without 
learning the name of a single state or city through which he passes, yet how few 
persons know even the names of the geological formations on which they have 
spent their lifetimes. Every one is taught geography, and there is scarcely a child 
of sufficient age who cannot tell the name of the town, county and state in which 
he lives. But geology, which is just as well worth knowing, is neglected, and 
there is but little opportunity for learning any thing practically in regard to it 
from those about us. This is not owing to a want of a desire for knowledge, but 
to a want of instruction in this science, and of the practical application of what 
is learned by adding local geological information in a handy, cheap and accessible 
form, and this, which no other work affords, it is the aim of this book to furnish. 
There are some kinds of knowledge too that cannot be obtained from books, 
but must be gathered by actual observation. The inspection of a formation in 
nature, which is pointed out to you, will teach you more in regard to it in a few 
minutes than you could learn from lectures or from reading books in as many 
hours, and the lesson so received will be better remembered. This book is intended 
as an intelligent guide to such observations. It tells you where the various 
formations are, and you can then see for yourself in traveling what they are. - 



THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 



How lonely would be a journey on which you would see not a single face that 
you know, and how different it would be if every one you meet were an old 
friend. So to the tourist new charms must be given to scenery, however attractive 
it may already be, if he knows something about its geology. The rocks, mountains, 
valleys and plains, although he sees them for the first time, are old friends in 
perhaps new and interesting forms. He meets them with a certain pleasure, for 
he understands what he sees and he is given the materials for many a happy hour 
of quiet and profitable reflection at home, on what he has seen on his railway 
journey. 

2. FOR GEOLOGISTS. 



But while the book is thus intended primarily as a series of object lessons for 
those to whom geology is yet a novelty, for the purpose of exciting an interest in, 
and which may ripen into a love for the science, it is believed that, being in a more 
convenient form than geological maps, and as no other work has attempted what 
is here done, all geologists, and especially students, will find it a most useful hand 
book on their railway journeys as well as for reference at home. It will be useful 
in laying down the geology in colors on any map which gives the railroads. 
Accurate geological maps can thus be made without expense, and there is no better 
exercise for students. It will also be invaluable in selecting a route of travel for 
geological study or for pleasure, and no geologist should make an excursion over 
new ground without this guide. It is a scientific catalogue of the great panorama 
that passes with its ever shif ting scenery before the eyes of the American railway 
traveler, and even an artist finds a catalogue of a picture gallery very necessary. 
No geologist need be told that it embraces the result of a vast amount of learning, 
labor and research in a very small compass, and a minuteness of local geology for 
which he might ransack libraries in vain, and which no one man could possibly 
furnish. Many men for many years have devoted the finest talents in America to 
the study of the geology of these states, and all have contributed by their published 
reports, or by direct original contributions to this work, portions of the knowledge 
which is here indexed, otherwise it would not be becoming for the author to say 
so much in its praise. In order that the guide might be as accurate as possible the 
assistance of the state geologist of each state, or that of some scientific gentleman 
best acquainted with its local geology, has been invoked to revise and correct the 
list of formations found along the railroads. Without a single exception, and with 
characteristic devotion to the cause of science/ this aid has been very cheerfully 
and promptly rendered, and in not a few instances, where the necessary information 
was only in the knowledge of these gentlemen, they have filled in the geology from 
original sources not yet published. Due credit is given to all contributors in the 
notes of the proper chapter. The general accuracy of the book can be relied 
upon as to the formations of each locality as they were understood at the time of 
its publication, and it may be regarded as in harmony with the latest results of 
geological research. If errors are found, consider the great number of railroad 
stations and you will wonder there are so few.

OBJECTS AND USES OF THIS WORK. 



3. FOR USEFUL, PRACTICAL PURPOSES. 

To those who take only utilitarian views and care nothing for pure science, 
and to all those in any way interested in the country, a means is here furnished for 
ascertaining the natural advantages or disadvantages of any district where there is 
a railroad, for it is now pretty well known to all intelligent persons that the 
capabilities or resources of a country, what it is and what it can become, depend 
chiefly on its geology. 

No one in our day can doubt, that there is a definite and orderly arrangement 
of the rocks, that it is only in certain rocks that certain useful materials and minerals 
are to be obtained, and that the soil of each formation has a certain fixed value for 
agriculture. It was long ago shown that a geological map of England, is a map 
also of the distribution of its manufacturer Even the kind of people inhabiting 
a district, often depends on its geology. A considerable portion of the work of 
geologists, is devoted to tracing out the distribution of the various formations as 
they come out from beneath one another, and spread over the face of the country. 
This book is made up of a minute tabular statement or division of all places on 
the American railways, into classes, some of which yield useful materials or pro- 
ductions peculiar to them. It points out the limits to be observed in searching out 
new locations producing any material. Besides, if accompanied by a correct 
scientific knowledge of the country, it will make any man&apos;s discovery of anything 
useful available to his neighbors in hundreds of other places, over the whole 
region covered by the same formation. 

The physical structure of a country being then, the means by which we can 
learn the range and distribution of useful materials, a strict attention to fossils is 
necessary, to enable us to determine the relative position of rock groups, each 
group, within certain limits, holding its own peculiar fossil forms, and certain 
economic products being confined, over wide areas, either wholly or principally to 
certain rocks. Many persons, ignorantly confounding the means with the .end, 
think geologists are good authorities upon fossils, but not as to the useful properties 
of the formations. Sir William E. Logan, the great Canadian geologist, in answer 
to this objection, once said : &quot; I am not a naturalist ; I do not describe fossils, but 
use them. They are the geologist&apos;s friends, who direct him hi the way to what is 
valuable. To get the necessary information from them, you must be able to 
recognize their aspect, and in order to state your authority, you must give their 
names. Some of them tell of coal they are cosmopolites ; while some give local 
intelligence of gypsum, or salt, or building stone. One of them helped us last 
year to trace out, in Canada, upwards of fifty miles of hydraulic limestone.&quot; 

But it is not practicable for ordinary readers to understand the difficult science 
of paleontology ; all they can expect to know are the results as ascertained by 
professional geologists, and those results are given in this little book, for every 
place on every railroad in America. There are many other things that might have 
been given, especially the structural geology of each State, geological maps, more 
minute lists of elevations and general physical geography, but the book contains 
enough for one little volume to be carried about on railway journeys.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS. 



INTENDED FOR RAILWAY TRAVELERS WHO ARE NOT VERSED IN 

GEOLOGY. 



All the rock-formations which appear on the surface of the globe, have been 
scientifically classified by geologists, according to the order in which they are 
found lying one upon another, and by the fossils they contain, and for our object 
may be conveniently included in twenty divisions or groups. In this work, the 
table of the names of the formations, groups and systems, published by Prof. J. D. 
Dana in his &quot;Manual of Geology&quot; and in his ** Text Book of Geology,&quot; has been 
taken as the general basis, by the geologists of many of the states who have 
assisted in preparing the following guide, but other valuable tables and especially 
one arranged by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, a general or combined table, and a 
list for each state at the beginning of the proper chapter, are also given. Numbers 
are attached to the names of the groups wherever they occur, making 20 in all. 
The subordinate members of each group, which are called formations, have the 
same number, but these sub-divisions are distinguished by the addition of small 
letters, a, b, c, etc., thus making in all 40 sub-divisions. By this means, the reader, 
although not familiar with geological tables, is at once enabled to see to what part 
of the general series any formation belongs, number 1 designating the oldest 
and number 30 the upper and last formed of alL Wherever the formations are 
found, they occur in the order as they are numbered, but the series in nature is 
never full, and in almost every locality one or more members of it are wanting. 

The true method by which each of the great stratified formations is distinguished 
is by its own characteristic fossils, but these descriptions, having been prepared for 
travelers, are confined to the general aspect of the rocks as seen hi passing them on 
the railways. They are intended to be popular rather than scientific, informing the 
reader what the formations are, what they look like, and their useful and valuable 
characters, qualities, and productions. It must also be borne in mind that this is a 
country of vast dimensions, and that the formations undergo important changes in 
their lithological character from place to place. 

Paleontology, and other interesting branches constituting the purely technical 
portion of the subject, are omitted. That ground has been well covered 
by all of the excellent illustrated text-books on geology, and one object of 
this work is to induce persons to take up their study. Results only are here given, 
not the method, by which they are attained. The thicknesses of the formations are 
sometimes stated, but as this might mislead the unprofessional reader, it should be 
observed, that the width of the surface occupied by a formation depends on the 
amount of dip in the beds. A group less than a hundred feet thick, lying 
horizontally, may cover several miles, while one of several thousand feet thick, if

1. EOZOIC (ARCH&gt;EAN, AZOIC), 



I. PRIMARY OR CRYSTALLINE ROCKS. 

The late investigations of American geologists have enabled them to 
establish several divisions in the crystalline stratified rocks, which were 
originally called Primary or Primitive. The name Azoic, formerly given to 
the Primary rocks to distinguish them from the Paleozoic formations, has, 
since the discovery of Eozoon in the former, been exchanged for that of 
Eozoic. The designation Archaean or ancient rocks, is used by Professor 
Dana and others, and applies to the Primitive formations without distinction. 
Among those who have made the Primitive or crystalline rocks a special 
subject of study for many years, no one is more eminent than Dr. T. Sterry 
Hunt, whose classification of these rocks established by him in North America 
has since been recognized by many geologists in Europe, where the same 
great groups are found. The following descriptions, giving the latest con- 
clusions as to the divisions of the Crystalline rocks, have been furnished by 
him for this second edition of this work. 

1 a. Laurentian. The name of Laurentian was given in 1854, by the 
geological survey of Canada, to the ancient crystalline terrane which forms 
the chief portion of the Laurentide hills, and of the Adirondacks. 

Throughout these areas the prevailing rock is a strong, massive gneiss, 
reddish or grayish in color, sparingly micaceous, but very often hornblendic. 
The predominance of this mineral occasionally gives rise to a nearly pure 
hornblende-rock, sometimes with a little intermixed feldspar. The gneisses 
are, for the most part, distinctly stratified, but occasionally the evidences 
of stratification are not very apparent, so that these rocks have often been 
designated granites. This series is distinguished by the absence of chloritic, 
talcose, argillaceous or micaceous schists. It includes, however, crystalline 
limestones, of which there are supposed to exist, in the Ottawa valley, three 
distinct masses in the Laurentian series, each of which is, in parts, according 
to Logan, more than 1,000 feet in thickness. These limestones, which are 
generally coarsely crystalline, are often magnesian, and abound in foreign 
minerals, chief among which are serpentine, chondrodite, hornblende, 
pyroxene, magnesian mica, apatite and graphite. Most of these occur both 
disseminated in the beds, and, aggregated with other minerals, in veins, or 
endogenous masses. Associated with these limestones are often considerable 
beds of quartz-rock, sometimes garnetiferous. Great masses of magnetic oxide 
of iron are also found interstratified in this series. The measured thickness 
of the Laurentian gneisses, with their included limestones and other rocks, 
on the Ottawa, where the strata are nearly vertical in attitude, has been 
estimated at over 17,000 feet. Beneath these, known as the Grenville series? 
there is a great underlying mass of granitoid gneiss, without limestones, and of 
undetermined thickness, called the Ottawa gneiss, which, it is conjectured, 
may not be conformable with the upper portions. 

In the Atlantic belt, considerable areas of Laurentian occur in Newfound- 
land, and probably in several parts of New England. A range of Laurentian 
rocks from the Western part of Connecticut extends south westward, forming 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 1 1 

the Highlands of the Hudson, and making the South Mountain as far as the 
Schuylkill; while a smaller range of the same, to the southeastward, forms 
the Welsh Mountain, in Pennsylvania. Little is known of the distribution of 
the Laurentian farther southward, but gneisses near Richmond in Virginia, 
and at Roan Mountain, in North Carolina, are referred to this terrane. 

Large areas of Laurentian occur around Lake Superior, and farther west 
in the Rocky Mountains, where they form the crystalline rocks of the Colo- 
rado range in the east, and those of the Wasatch in the west, and probably 
occur in many other parts of the region. To the Laurentian belong the 
gneisses of the Western Islands of Scotland, those of Scandinavia and Finland, 
and large portions of those of the Alps. The limestones of the Laurentian 
contain the remains of a foraminiferal organism known as Eozoon Canadense 
(Dawson), which has been found in several localities in Canada, and also in 
Bavaria, and in Finland. Accompanying it are several other small forms, 
regarded as organic, and referred to the protozoa. 

1 b, Norian.-The upper portion of the Laurentian series on the Ottawa 
river, was orginally defined by the geological survey of Canada as consisting of 
a rock, gneissoid or granitoid in character, made up chiefly of labradorite, or 
related anorthic feldspars, but including also true gneisses and crystalline 
limestones, not unlike those already described in the Laurentian. Subsequent 
studies in Canada led to the conclusion that these rocks constitute a distinct 
terrane, resting uncomformably upon the gneisses and crystalline limestones oi 
the preceding series, and the two were respectively designated as Lower 
Laurentian and Upper Laurentian or Labradorian. As the newer is very distinct 
from the older terrane, it has, however, been thought better to restrict the 
name of Laurentian to the latter. A series precisely similar to the upper one 
occurs in Norway, where, as in North America, it rests upon Laurentian 
gneisses, and where the name of norite has been given to the feldspathic rock 
which is its chief characteristic. Hence, the name of Norian, which has been 
chosen in place of Upper Laurentian, as the designation of the terrane. It 
is conjectured, from the fact that it has yet been found only in contact with 
the Laurentian, and from its including gneisses and limestones lithologically 
similar to those of the latter, that it is next in age. 

The norites consist, for the greater part, of anorthic or plagioclase feldspars, 
sometimes almost without admixture, but at other times accompanied by small 
portions of hornblende, of pyroxene or of hypersthene, constituting what has 
been called hypersthenite or hyperite. Chrysolite, red garnet, green epidote, 
biotite, and ilmenite are often present, and these minerals are generally 
arranged in such a way as to give a gneissoid structure to the rock. The 
texture ia sometimes fine-grained and compact, and at other times more coarsely 
granular, and even granitoid, displaying great masses of the plagioclase feldspar, 
frequently opalescent, and varying in composition from anorthite to andesine. 
The colors of the norites vary from white, pale bluish or greenish, rarely 
reddish, to dark lavender or smoke-blue, or nearly black. 

The principal area of this terrane known in the United States is in Essex 
county, New York, where it covers several hundred square miles, and, although 
highly inclined, rests unconformably, according to Professor Hall, upon the 



12 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

Laurentian. It is well displayed upon the shore of Lake Champlain, between 
Port Kent and Westport, and forms some of the highest hills of the interior. 
A second large area of Norian occurs north of Montreal, where it is similarly 
related to the Laurentian, and passes below the Potsdam sandstone. Other 
localities along the valley of the St. Lawrence are at Chateau Richer near 
Quebec, at Bay St. Paul, the Bay of Seven Islands, and on the River Moisie. 
Extensive areas of it also exist on the coast of Labrador. The same rock has 
been found on the east shore of Lake Huron, at the west end of Lake Superior, 
as at Duluth, and in Wyoming Territory. 

It c. Arvonian. There is found in many localities a series of highly inclined 
stratified rocks, consisting essentially of petrosilex or halleflinta, often passing 
into a quartziferous porphyry. There are found with it strata of vitreous 
quartzite and thin layers of soft micaceous schists, besides great beds of hema- 
tite, and, more rarely, layers of crystalline limestone. This group, which has 
a thickness of many thousand feet, was at first included in the succeeding 
Huronian series, which, however, apparently overlies it unconformably. 

Its relations with the preceding groups have not been clearly determined, 
fcut it appears to be identical, both in position and in character, with the 
group, which in Wales has, since 1878, been called Arvonian. These Arvonian 
rocks are well seen at many points along the coast of Massachusetts and New 
Brunswick and in the Atlantic belt in southern Pennsylvania. Areas of them 
are also seen on the north shore of Lake Superior, and rising through the 
paleozoic sandstones in Wisconsin. They appear under similar conditions in 
southeast Missouri, where they include great beds of iron-oxyd. 

I d. Huronian, The name of Huronian was given in 1855 by the geological 
survey of Canada, to a series of more or less schistose crystalline rocks, shown 
to rest upon the Laurentian series on the north shore of Lakes Huron and 
Superior. A similar series is largely developed in the Atlantic belt in New- 
foundland, in the province of Quebec, and in New England, and farther south- 
westward in the Blue Ridge. The Huronian differs from the preceding series 
by the frequent presence of schistose rocks, and of conglomerates, which con- 
tain fragments of the underlying gneisses. The Huronian contains a consider- 
able portion of epidote, hornblende and pyroxene, and is marked by varieties 
of diabasic rocks, often called gabbros, which are truly stratified, but are not to 
be confounded with the norites of the Norian series, to which the name of 
gabbro is also often given. The Huronian series moreover includes imperfect 
gneisses, quartzites, dolomites, serpentines, and steatite, besides large amounts 
of chloritic, micaceous and argillaceous schists. Its thickness has been esti- 
mated at about 18,000 feet, and it is often found resting unconformably upon 
the gneiss of the Laurentian. Ores of copper, nickel, chrome and iron are 
common in the Huronian series, which is penetrated in many localities by 
unstratified rocks, both granite and doleritic. 

The rocks in the British Islands, which have lately been described by the 
name of Pebidian, are apparently identical with the Huronian ; and the great 
series in the Alps, known to the Italians as the pietri verdi, or greenstone 
group, or at least its lower portion, has both the lithological characters and 
the geognostical relations of the Huronian, to which it is now generally 
referred. Similar crystalline schists found in California, both in the foot-hills

2-4. CAMBRIAN (OR LOWER SILURIAN) AGE. 



J a. Acadian. This series is found at Braintree, in Massachusetts, at Stjj 
John, in New Brunswick, and at St. John, in Newfoundland. It includes on 
thousand feet or more of f ossilif erous sandstone and shale, and according to Dr, 
Hunt, corresponds to the Menevian of Great Britain. It has only been found 
-along the north-eastern border of the Atlantic belt. It is remarkable as a fossil 
iferous rock below the Potsdam, which had, before its discovery, always been COD 
sidered as the lowest formation of that description on the continent. 

2 b. Potsdam. The Potsdam sandstone, was for a long time considered at 
the lowest sedimentary fossiliferous rock. It is usually of a purely quartzosc 
character, generally gray, though often striped, and sometimes partially 01 
entirely red. In places it appears as a conglomerate, but sometimes the enclosed 
masses are angular, showing them to be near their source. Hall, N. Y. R., 2&apos;^ 
It is a hard silicious sandstone, white, red, gray, yellowish, and frequently stripe d 
Some strata of this rock are covered with the most beautifully characteriz | 
ripple-marks as perfect as if just formed on the sand of a sea-beach, whil 
the rock is the most indurated kind of sandstone. Its lower portion is a 
.granitic conglomerate, hi which large masses of quartz, the size of a peck 
measure, are often enveloped ; they are rounded and water- worn, and held togethei 
by a finer variety of the same material. On the Canada slope, where the 
mass is 300 feet thick, it is wholly a conglomerate, made up of coarse materials. 
The part which is properly a sandstone, has two principal varieties, a close grained, 
sharp edged mass, with natural joints traversing it in two directions, but so closely 
wedged together that it is quarried with difficulty. This is the Keeseville variety, 
and that of Pa. and N. J. The other, the typical mass at Potsdam, is an even 
bedded and somewhat porous rock, at many places a distinct friable sandstone 
in others a yellowish-brown sandstone, the particles of which are compacts 
together, so as to form a firm, even-grained mass, with the planes of deposit&apos; 
perfectly smooth and separable from each other, the layers being from two inc&apos; 
to four feet thick. At Potsdam quarries, a layer of 100 square feet may be rai 
and split into rails, six inches wide and ten feet long, or it may be broken k 
pieces the size of a brick, with even edges of fracture, and each layer may t -&apos; 
separated into many. The color here is yellowish-brown, and a deep red varietj 
occurs at Chazy, resting immediately upon the primitive rock. Mather, 102. It 
is nowhere charged with mineral matter, either disseminated or in veins. The 
native copper of Lake Superior is in an old trappean formation, and has no relation 
to the neighboring extensive formation of Potsdam. In an economical point of 
view, the Potsdam is unimportant as a depository of useful substances.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 15 

The general color of the stone at Potsdam is yellowish-brown, but the 
tint of each layer differs somewhat from those adjacent to it, so that the rock, 
upon the fractured edges, wears a slightly striped aspect. It is the finest quarry 
atone in the state, being so perfectly workable and manageable. 360. It is an ex- 
cellent building material, holding mortar well, and makes a dry house. 29. Under 
the Potsdam, and upon the primary rock, is the position of the specular and red 
oxide of iron. V. 267. 

In Minnesota, the lower portion of the formation is 400 feet thick, and is hard 
and often vitreous, and usually of a brick-red color, with very distinct layers, often 
separated into slaty layers by partings of red shale, strongly marked with 
fucoidal impressions, frequently ripple-marked and cracked. The upper part of 
the formation, there called the St. Croix sandstone, is white or buff in color, often 
friable, and constitutes a heavy bedded or massive sandstone of rounded quartzose 
grams. N. H. Winchell. 

In Minnesota and Iowa, the Potsdam proper, omitting the St. Croix sandstone, 
is a friable, crumbling mass, of no value for building purposes except as 
sand, consisting of a pure silicious sand in minute grains, with a very slight 
amount of cementing matter. Unless protected by some more resisting rock 
above it the Potsdam appears in steep slopes, or low, gently swelling hills and 
mound-like eminences. Those portions which are hard and enduring are cemented 
by oxide of iron, and have a brown color. 

In Wisconsin, the Potsdam is 800 to 1000 feet thick, and has a much larger 
surface-development than elsewhere, as will be seen by the great number of 
railway-stations on it. It extends over 12,000 square miles, and contains many 
fossils not found in New York. Where the Potsdam in Wisconsin is on the surface, 
and not covered by drift, there is usually a loose, sandy soil, with a sparse growth 
of small oak and pine timber. This formation is one that has been very properly 
allowed to retain its original name almost undisputed all over the United States, 
except that Professor Owen at first called it the LOWER SANDSTONE, in the North 
West to distinguish it from the 3 c., St. Peters or Upper Sandstone. 

In Michigan, the Potsdam is the red sandstone, which is emphatically the 
chief rock that appears upon the immediate coast of the whole south shore of 
Lake Superior, and forms the Pictured Rocks and the Falls of St. Marie. Here it 
is of inconsiderable thickness, but it regularly thickens in going westward. 
Houghton, 4th R., 500. Some have referred the Lake Superior sandstone to the 
age of the Chazy, but the late studies of Rominger show that it is really of 
Potsdam age. The Chicago Tribune office building is of this Lake Superior 
sandstone, and the Court House at Milwaukee is another conspicuous specimen. 

In Pennsylvania, the Potsdam is a compact, fine-grained, white and yellowish 
vitreous sandstone, containing specks of Kaolin. 

The Potsdam formation is supposed by some to be represented in the Green 
Pond Mountain of New Jersey by a local deposit of coarse conglomerate, 3000 feet 
thick, but others deny that this mountain is Potsdam. It is less than 30 feet thick 
where it is seen rising from beneath the limestones of the Lehigh River, but 
increases hi thickness westward and southward, until it comes to be represented in 
Tennessee by many thousand feet of alternate coarse and fine deposits. See 
Safford&apos;s Geol. R. of Tenn. 



16 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 



3 a. Calciferous, This group embraces in New York three distinct 
as to character and position, and these alternate and intermix with each 
other. The first is silicious, compact, and may probably be the continuation 
of the Potsdam sandstone. The second is a variable mixture of fine, yellow, 
silicious sand and dolomite or magnesian carbonate of lime, which, when 
fractured, presents a fine, sparkling grain. It is in irregular layers, which 
have a shattered appearance, from numerous cracks, the parts being more 
or less separated from each other. This is the mass from which the name 
Calciferous sandrock was derived. The third is a mixture of the dolomite 
material, which is usually yellowish, very granular when fresh broken, and 
of a compact limestone, which resembles the Birdseye. The action of the 
weather gives these layers the appearance of Gothic fret-work, and the color 
becomes a dark yellow-brown. V. 21. As its name indicates, it is a sandy 
magnesian limestone, but it is not destitute of beds of pure limestone. The 
mixture of a variety of mineral matter causes the rock to weather unequally ; 
hence it is often rough externally, portions of the silicious part standing out 
in relief. There are two quite uniform characters which distinguish the 
Calciferous, viz : A fine crystalline structure intermixed with earthy matter 
and numerous small masses of calcareous spar. E. 105. Great numbers 
of quartz crystals are found in the cavities of this formation, many of them 
very perfect as to form and transparency. V. 30. 

In the Mississippi basin this formation is called the LOWER MAGNESIAN 
LIMESTONE, to distinguish it from the Upper or Trenton limestone. The 
eastern name, Calciferous or lime-bearing sandrock, does not apply, as it is 
almost free from sand. As its western name indicates, it is a dolomite or 
magnesian limestone, and makes an excellent lime for building purposes. 
It usually contains about one equivalent or forty-five per cent of carbonate 
of magnesia. This limestone forms the summits of the bluffs of the Missis- 
sippi ; it supports high table-lands that extend back from the river, and forms 
prominent angles to the summits of the bluffs on either side of that river. 
These even and heavy layers are those usually quarried for building-stone. 
D. D. Owen gives descriptions of the picturesque character of the landscape 
in the region of the Upper Mississippi, and especially the striking similarity 
which the roek exposures present to ruined structures, and his report is 
illustrated by beautiful engravings showing the castellated appearance of the 
cliffs of the Lower Magnesian limestone on the Iowa river. In Pennsylvania 
it is a coarse, gray, calcareous sandstone, containing cavities enclosing very 
minute crystals of quartz and calcareous spar. 

3 b. Chazy. To the Calciferous succeeds the Chazy limestone. As a whole, 
it is a dark, irregular, thick-bedded limestone. At Chazy, New York, on Lake 
Champlain, it contains many rough, irregular, flinty or cherty masses. At 
Essex the beds are more regular, and form, in consequence, a better building 
stone. As a limestone it is purer than the Calciferous, being non-magnesian; 
the principal foreign matter is silica in the form of chert. It is free from the 
brown earthy spots, and the masses of brown calcareous spar so common in 
the Calciferous sandrock. 

This formation is 130 feet thick on Lake Champlain, but it is less constant 
in the series than the others, and as it is not an important formation on the 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 17 

lines of the railroads, an extended description is not here necessary. It is not 
found in the valley of the Mohawk. Its fossils are found in Pennsylvania and 
Virginia, but its limits are not there denned. In the Northwestern States the 
St. Peter sandstone occupies the same place in the series as the Chazy in the 
east. 

3 b. St. Peter Sandstone (Upper Sandstone of Owen). This is a western 
formation and does not occur in the Eastern States, but Prof. Lesley thinks it 
may have representatives in the massive silicious members of the great lime- 
stone mass of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet thick, as measured along the two branches 
of the Juniata in Pennsylvania. It is first recognized in going west, to the south- 
west of Winnebago Lake. It is also seen up the Mississippi, near St. Paul 
and St. Anthony, and on the streams of northeast Iowa, and at La Salle, Illi- 
nois, where it is brought to the surface by an anticlinal axis. It is remarkable 
for its uniform thickness, which is from 72 to 100 feet over a space of 500 miles 
in length and 400 miles in width. In Central Wisconsin, however, its thick- 
ness is very irregular. It is also of the same character throughout, being com- 
posed of wonderfully uniform and exceedingly minute grains of sand, held 
together by the merest trace of cement, so that the mass may easily be moved 
with shovel and pick, as is everywhere done for the purpose of obtaining sand 
for mortar. This sandstone, though usually white, sometimes assumes a buff 
or brown color from the presence of iron, and in some localities it becomes red or 
is marked by bands of a bright green color. It appears like a recurrence of 
the Lower or Potsdam sandstone. Being composed almost entirely of pure 
silica, it is, when not colored by oxide of iron, one of the very best materials 
yet discovered in the west for the manufacture of glass. It is the same as 
that known in Missouri as saccharoidal sandstone, which is carried to Pitts- 
burgh, Pennsylvania, and used by the glass-makers in manufacturing the best 
kinds of glass. See note 2, Missouri. 

4 a. Trenton Limestone. Next in ascending order occurs the 4 a. Trenton 
limestone, which, in the Northwestern States, is divided into the Buff lime- 
stone and Blue limestone. In Wisconsin there are two buff and two blue beds 
alternating. They are undoubtedly the same as the well known Chazy, Birds- 
eye, Black River and Trenton limestones of New York and other Eastern 
States. They are known in the West wherever the exposures reach to the upper 
sandstone. 

The upper member of the 4 a. Trenton limestone, in South Western Wis- 
consin and the adjoining parts of Illinois and Iowa, is the very important 
GALENA or lead-producing limestone, which has no exact representation in the 
Eastern States. It is a light gray or a yellowish-gray, heavy-bedded rock. 
It is compact, minutely crystalline throughout, often with small cavities lined 
with crystals of brown spar, and the whole thickness of the formation is 250 
feet. The Galena or lead ore contains 13.4 per cent, of sulphur and 86.6 per 
cent, of lead, and is found in heavy bodies in crevices in this Galena dolomite 
or magnesian limestone. Prof. J. D. Whitney, in his admirable report on the 
geology of the lead region of Southwestern Wisconsin, has proved that these 
lead deposits must have been introduced into the fissures by precipitation from 
above. The lead mines of Missouri are chiefly in the Lower Magnesian lime- 
sU&gt;ne. 



18 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

In Wisconsin, a very noticeable feature of the Trenton limestone is its 
marked division into the two parts before mentioned. One, which is the lower 
half, is very heavy bedded, in layers of two or three feet thick, known as the 
glass-rock, and the other thin bedded, in layers of two or three inches. There 
is always a stratum of carbonaceous shale from a quarter of an inch to a foot or 
more in thickness, which separates the blue or Trenton from the thin bedded 
Galena limestone above it. 

Professor R. D. Irving describes the Galena limestone as almost invariably 
a very compact, hard, crystalline rock, of a yellowish -gray color, with numer- 
ous small cavities filled with a softer material, or lined with crystals of calcite. 
The upper portion is thick bedded and free from flints, the layers being from 
one to four feet thick, while the lower portion almost invariably consists of 
several feet of layers from one to two inches thick. Good exposures of parts 
of the Galena limestone are frequently to be met with. It may be seen in 
cliffs and ledges, on nearly all the streams in the lead region, where it weathers 
irregularly, leaving the surface full of small cavities, due to the removal of its 
softer parts. The formation contains masses of flint in layers, or in irregular 
pieces, which are principally confined to the middle and lower parts of the 
formation, although not entirely absent from any part. 

In the interior valleys of Pennsylvania, as for example, in Sinking Valley. 
Blair Co., considerable quantities of zinc ore, and some galena, have been 
found in the Trenton limestone group, which is there at least&quot; 1,000 feet thick. 
The lead mines of Wythe Co., Virginia, are at the same, or at a somewhat 
lower horizon. The zinc mines near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and near 
Landisville, Lancaster Co., are nearly of the same geological age. Isolated 
crystals or small masses of galena occur in crevices in the limestone beds of 
this age throughout the entire range of the great valley from Newburgh, on 
the Hudson, to Chattanooga, in Tennessee. The limestones in this valley, 
which are the Auroral limestones of H. D. Rogers, are, by some geologists, 
referred to an older series. 

In the State of New York the lower part of the Trenton is called the 
Birdseye. It is a perfectly pure limestone, and the next layer, which is the 
middle or Black River sub-division, is sometimes used as a marble. It is 
solid, hard, and easily worked, by reason of its conchoidal fracture, and is 
valuable for lime and for building. 

The upper part of the formation, or Trenton limestone proper in New 
York, consists of two distinct varieties, at Trenton Falls. The first or upper 
part is a dark or black colored, fine grained limestone, in thin layers, sepa- 
rated regularly by black shale or slate, forming the great mass in which the 
creek has worn its channel, and in which are all the falls. See Note 62, 
New York. 

The second, or lower part of the Trenton proper, is a gray, coarse grained 
limestone, in thick layers, and it is quite crystalline. This is the quarry- 
stone at Prospect, above Trenton Falls. At Montreal, the church of Notre 
Dame and many other structures are constructed of the gray variety of the 
Trenton limestone, quarried behind the city, but the thinner layers, when 
not dressed, are of a more pleasing color, and make a handsomer building- 
stone. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 19 

The Trenton formation in all parts of the United States, is almost always 
a limestone. A conspicuous example of the Trenton, Utica aud Hudson 
River formations, is seen in the long continuous and beautiful valley of the 
Hudson and Lake Champlain, the Kittatinny valley of New Jersey, the 
Cumberland valley of Pennsylvania, the Shenandoah valley of Virginia, and 
the valley of East Tennessee. The fertility of its limestone land is almost 
inexhaustible. The deposits of brown hematite iron ore, found in the soil, 
and occupying hollows or basins in the softer limestones below the Trenton 
in so many places, and in such large quantities, are supposed by some to be 
of aqueous origin, and not strictly a product of this formation, which is only 
its receptacle. But many other geologists, R. M. S. Jackson, A. A. Hender- 
son, Lesley, Platt, Prime and Frazer, have all agreed in advocating the oppo- 
site view, each from his own independent studies. They derive the limonite 
beds either from the solution of the ferriferous limestone layers, or from 
the intercalated micaceous slates, or from the pyrites-bearing slates of the 
neighborhood. According to Dr. Hunt, it comes from the change of masses 
both of iron-pyrites and of carbonate of iron, originally imbedded in the 
limestones and slates. 

4 b, Utica Slate. The Trenton limestone is succeeded by a dark or 
black carbonaceous slate, called the Utica slate. In Pennsylvania this for- 
mation is everywhere darkly colored, and the coloring matter is probably 
derived from abundant remains of marine plants or animals. While the 
black color of some of the clays in the brown hematite ore banks of the 
upper range (immediately beneath the Utica slate), as at the mines in Lehigh 
Co., Pa., and the Brandon ore mine in Vermont, seems to be derived from 
the black slates of the Utica, the gray color of some of the limestones, and 
of the carbonate ores (as at the Saucon zinc mines) is known to be due to 
disseminated graphite. 

Within the State of New York, it is everywhere black, and usually soft 
and fissile. Thin beds of impure limestone are associated with it in many 
places, and sometimes thin layers of carbonate of iron, and it passes into the 
Trenton limestone by gradual interstratification. Thus bands of slate are 
interstratified in the limestone, and thin strata of limestone containing fossil 
remains in the lower part of the slate. These crumbling shales may generally 
be distinguished by their dark blue-black and brownish-black color, but 
there are some strata among the grits of the Hudson River that can scarcely 
be distinguished from these. The Utica slate weathers ash-gray, rapidly 
disintegrates, and, where it is exposed in cliffs, frost and other agents con- 
stantly break it into small fragments, which collect at the base in the form 
of a talus. In Pennsylvania, it outcrops, with little or no variation, as a dark 
blue carbonaceous elate and shale, extremely fissile in its lower beds. It 
forms the surface-rock along a narrow region in the Mohawk valley. In 
East Tennessee, the beds both of Utica and Hudson River, or Cincinnati, 
are of great extent, and consist of blue calcareous and sandy shales, with 
some layers of calcareous sandstone. Professor Hall considers the Utica slate 
as properly the lower member of the Hudson River group. 

4. c, Hudson River (Cincinnati, Nashville, Loraine and Frankfort sand- 
stone and shale). The rocks of this group in New York are mostly slates,

shales and gray, slaty and thick-bedded grits. The slates and shales are 
generally dark brown, blue and black, and the grits are gray, greenish and 
bluish-gray. They are stratified and conformable, alternating a great number 
of times, without any regular order of alternation, and in Eastern New York 
are from 500 to 800 feet thick. The first New York geologists called this 
formation the Grey wacke, and it is still so called by the stone-cutters on the 
River Hudson. Its lower portion was called the Frankfort slate and sand- 
stone, and the upper part the Pulaski shale and sandstone, which latter were 
afterwards called the Loraine shale. Wherever streams have passed over it 
they have, in process of time, worn in the rocks a deep channel or gorge 
sometimes preventing a free communication across them, as at Loraine (see 
Note No. 69, New York). By decomposition, it produces a tenacious, clayey 
soil, favorable for grass, forming the best dairy-land, as in Orange Co., New 
York, about Goshen and Middletown. ?t increases in thickness southward 
BO rapidly that at the Delaware and Lehigh water gaps, measurements of 
5,000 feet have been made through it, from its top downward, without reach- 
ing its lower limit. 

In many places along its last outcrop toward the Atlantic, it has fur- 
nished many masses of a substance resembling anthracite, also beds of impure 
limestone, and beds of red shale, which increase very much going south into 
Virginia. 

In Pennsylvania, the Hudson River slate consists of blue and greenish- 
gray shale, alternating with gray calcareous and argillaceous sandstone in 
thin beds. The sandstones grow more abundant as we ascend in the for- 
mation. The middle portion, where much metamorphosed and intersected 
by cleavage-planes, in certain localities, produces a good roofing-slate, as at 
Slatington and Delaware Water Gap, Pa. 

The geologists of the Western States generally, have dropped the desig- 
nation of Hudson River, at least in regard to strata west of the Alleghanies, 
and have substituted for it the name, CINCINNATI, proposed by Worthen and 
Meek; making this term co-extensive with the former. In this guide, 
Hudson River is used in the Eastern, and Cincinnati in the Western States. 
At Cincinnati the whole series is about 800 feet thick, and, according to 
Dr. Newberry, by its fossils, is the equivalent of the Chazy, Trenton, ITtica 
and Hudson River, all blended together. In Ohio it is composed of alter- 
nating beds of limestone and shale, the latter sometimes called blue clay. 
The limestone is an even-bedded, firm, durable, semi-crystalline limestone, 
crowded with fossils. It is commonly called the blue limestone, but the 
prevailing color is grayish-blue, and the weathered surface shows yellowish 
or light-gray shades. In southern Illinois the lower part of the Cincinnati 
is composed of brown sandy shales and sandstone, and the upper portion is 
a thin-bedded, dark bluish-gray, fine grained limestone, two to six inches 
thick, with shaly partings between the layers. In northern Illinois it is 
bituminous, and consists of sandy shales with thin bands of limestone. In 
Iowa it is the Maquoketa shales, which are bluish and brownish shales form- 
ing a stiff clay soil. In Missouri the upper shale bed only is found, with an 
occasional flag-like limestone layer.

It should here be said that in the opinion of the earlier American geologists, 
Amos Eaton and Ebenezer Emmons, and as now maintained by Dr. Sterry 
Hunt, considerable portions of the strata above described, including what is 
called Potsdam sandstone in Pennsylvania, along the Appalachian Valley from 
New England to Alabama, as well as the great mass of accompanying lime- 
stones the Auroral of Rogers belongs to the Lower Taconic or Taconian 
series, and is of pre-Cambrian age. The name of Hudson River group, has 
hitherto been used in a very vague sense, and made to include not only the 
upper schistose beds, including the roofing-slate of the Taconian, and the 
much more recent Loraine or Cincinnati shales, but also a great intermediate 
series, called by Eaton the First or Transition Greywacke the Utica, Loraine, 
and Oneida being his Secondary Greywacke. 

This First Greywacke series, along the eastern border of the Appalachian 
valley in New York and New England, and thence southwest on the one hand, 
and northeast to the lower St. Lawrence on the other, is a great belt of dis- 
turbed strata, which were for a long time assigned by some geologists to a 
position above the Trenton limestone, while by others they were regarded as 
below that horizon, and of the age of the Potsdam and Calciferous divisions. 
Emmons, who for many years maintained the latter view, called these rocks 
the Taconic slates or Upper Taconic, a name which Logan, when he finally ac- 
cepted this conclusion, changed to that of the Quebec group, divided into three 
parts, named by him Sillery, Lauzon, and Levis ; the latter being supposed by 
him the oldest. It has since been shown that the Sillery is the oldest and the 
Levis the newest, its fauna approaching that of the Chazy ; while some portions 
of this group (afterwards distinguished by Logan as Potsdam) contain a fauna 
as old, or older, than the typical Potsdam. These rocks, which have an aggregate 
thickness of 7,000 feet or more, are much disturbed, and include portions of 
strata of later date, Ordovician and Silurian. To this essentially Cambrian 
series, as already said, belongs a great part of what has been called Hudson 
River group, though this name, in paleontology, has been restricted to the 
Loraine shales, which belong to a higher Ordovician horizon. T. S. H. 

Keweenian. This name has been given to the great copper-bearing series 
of the Lake Superior basin, which, while resting in the different parts upon 
various crystalline groups, is unconformably overlaid by the Cambrian sand- 
stones of the Potsdam. It is made up chiefly of sandstones and conglomer- 
ates, with interposed layers of basic eruptive rocks of cotemporaneous origin, 
generally designated melaphyres. This series abounds in metallic copper, 
found both in veins, and in the beds, but most abundantly in certain con- 
glomerates. The thickness of the Keweenian is not less than 20,000 feet, and 
perhaps much greater. Notwithstanding its great antiquity the Keweenian 
does not belong to the crystalline rocks. (T. STKRRY HUNT.)

5-8. SILURIAN (OR UPPER SILURIAN) AGE. 

5 a. Medina. The lower member of this formation is a pebbly sandstone 
or grit called the Oneida conglomerate, being the same as the Shawangunk 
conglomerate. The upper member is called distinctively the Medina sandstone, 
and is usually a red or mottled argillaceous sandstone. 

1. The Oneida conglomerate in New York is composed of quartz pebbles rarely 
exceeding three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and of white or yellowish quartz- 
sand. In some localities there is some interposed greenish shale. The source of its 
materials was to the south, the rock being 500 feet thick in the Shawangunk 
Mountain at Wurtsburg, on the N.Y.&amp;Os. Mid. R. R., and 1000 feet thick in some 
parts of Pennsylvania and Tennessee. The greatest thickness of the Oneida in 
the eastern part of New York is 30 to 40 feet, but in the western part the 
same place is occupied by a gray quartzose sandstone, fine grained and compact. 
Passing upwards, the gray sandstone intermingles with the Medina sandstone, 
which, in its lower parts, differs chiefly in color. The red color of the Medina 
sandstone seems to be partially communicated to the gray below, which is often 
striped and spotted with red. There is, lithologically, no very strong line of 
demarcation between the two rocks. The oxide of iron, the red coloring matter 
of the upper member, has been transfused through the material of the lower as 
far as its particles could find admittance. The flagstones in the side- walks of 
Buffalo and Rochester, of a white color clouded with red, are of this formation . 

In New Jersey the gray sandstone formation consists of a thick series of hard, 
white and whitish gray siliceous rocks, of various degrees of coarseness, from that 
of a fine grained, pure sandstone to that of a quartzose conglomerate with 
thickly-set pebbles averaging half an inch in diameter. This is the summit of the 
long, straight mountain ridge called the Kittatinny or North Mountain, extending 
from near the Hudson River into Virginia. 

In Pennsylvania the Oneida conglomerate is a compact, greenish-gray, massive 
sandstone, containing in many places thick beds of siliceous conglomerate, and 
the Medina sandstone proper is a thick mass of alternating red shales and red and 
gray earthy sandstones . It is the North Mountain of the great Cumberland valley. 

At the Delaware Water-Gap the whole mass of Oneida and Medina consists 
of seven massive plates of coarse sand and conglomerate, separated by more 
argillaceous layers from each other. Going west, the number, according to Prof. 
Lesley, is reduced to five, and finally in Middle Pennsylvania to two, each of them 
very thick, and making its own mountain-crest when the dip is vertical, while the 
intermediate softer red mass forms a little valley between the crests. The whole 
formation is about 1,900 feet thick. When the dip is gentle, the Oneida 
makes a beautiful lofty terrace upon the flank of the mountain, the crest of which 
is always made by the Upper Medina. Traced southward through Virginia into 
Tennessee , this formation gradually thins away to 50 feet, as seen west of Knoxville. 

2 . The Medina sandstone proper succeeds the gray sandstone, there being no 
definite line of division between them. In this rock is found the Fucoides Harlani 
affording a positive character whereby to recognize it in the series . This sandstone 
is almost invariably of a red color, generally a brown-red, more rarely variegated 
light red and yellowish, and in a few rare instances of a light or whitish color, 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 23 



partially greenish. It is both fine grained and coarse grained, the latter usually of the 
deepest color, the former more variegated. The lower falls of the Genesee, below 
Rochester, 110 feet hi height, are formed by this rock. The deep gorge and 
high cliffs on both sides of the Niagara River, at Lewiston, New York, are more 
than one-half excavated hi the Medina. 

In New Jersey it is a thick formation of red and variegated sandstones and 
shales. Its lower beds are a dark red sandstone of a very ferruginous composition, 
and extreme hardness, and in the middle and upper divisions of a brownish red 
shale and a very argillaceous sandstone, partly calcareous. 

Neither the Oneida nor Medina are found west of Ohio. Some large masses of galena 
and copper-pyrites with blende, have been found in the Oneida or Shawangunk 
grit, on the Erie R . R. east of Port Jervis and at Ellenville, but they were soon 
exhausted. When the Medina is a heavy coarse rock it produces a poor, barren 
country, but hi Western New York it is more calcareous, and the soil is much better. 

5 b. Clinton. This group consists of many different kinds of rocks or 
masses, from which circumstance it was first called the Protean group. The 
name of Clinton was given to it on account of the characteristic masses being found 
around the village of Clinton, in Oneida County, New York. It consists of green 
and black-blue shale, greenish, gray and red, soft marly layers, often laminated 
calcareous sandstone, encrinal sandstone, and red f ossilif erous iron-ore beds . The 
most persistent member of the group is the shale. It is bluish when fresh quarried, 
but when long exposed it is always of a greenish hue. The next member is the 
greenish sandstone, which is hi thin layers, having its surface generally covered with 
fucoides. This also has a bluish tint when fresh quarried. The third persistent 
member consists of two iron-ore beds in New York and several hi Pennsylvania. 

The term Protean is still applicable to the Clinton group, which, in some 
places, consists of thin shaly sandstones, shales, and even conglomerates ; in others, 
of thin bedded, impure limestones, ehaly sandstones, iron-ores, etc : still again it 
appears as a duplicate series of shales, limestones and iron-ores, with some 
intermixture of sandy matter, all containing an abundance of marine shells. In 
the west the formation is limestone, and is of a more uniform character. 

The Clinton formation produces the celebrated fossiliferous iron-ore generally 
known as the FOSSIL OEB, which occurs hi it in every state from New York to 
Alabama. In all its localities this ore is red or brownish-red, very hard, and where 
unaltered, invariably oolitic or in larger sized concretions. In New York, where 
it is extensively mined, there are two beds of it, generally about 20 feet apart, and 
upon an average about a foot and more in thickness. The ooJitic particles are 
usually more abundant hi the lower, the larger sized concretions hi the upper bed. 
The two beds never appear at the same locality, or in the same line of section, but 
where the lower one occurs the upper one is wanting, and where the upper one 
occurs the lower one is not found. 

In Pennsylvania the Clinton is a very extensive formation, nearly 2,000 feet 
thick, of slate, shales, sandstones and iron-ore, with the same variety as elsewhere, 
and its iron ore is very rich, productive and valuable. The outcrop of the ore- 
beds have been traced for hundreds of miles. In Dodge County, Wisconsin, near 
Milwaukee, the Clinton iron-ore, at Iron Ridge, is from 15 to 18 feet thick, but 
this is very unusual, and it is not in the same part of the formation as the fossil 
ore hi the east . The deposits of this ore in East Tennessee and in Alabama, 
called the Dye-stone ore, are still more extensive. 



24 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

1 5 c. Niagara. This group consists of two distinct members, a shale below 
and a limestone above. 

The shale in New York constitutes a very uniform deposit, while the limestone, 
from a thin concretionary mass in the east, becomes an extensive and conspicuous 
rock, constantly increasing in thickness, in a western direction, even far beyond 
the limits of that state. The cataract of Niagara is produced by the passage of 
the river over this limestone and shale, and, from being a well known and 
extremely interesting point, as well as exhibiting the greatest natural development 
of these rocks in New York, this name was adopted for its designation. In this 
vicinity, the limestone is 164 feet thick, with the shale beneath 80 feet thick. The 
lower part of the Niagara group exhibits a great development of dark bluish 
shale, which, on exposure, gradually changes to gray or ashen color, and forms 
a bluish or grayish marly clay. In this state it is undistinguishable from the 
ordinary clays, and its outcropping edges, when long weathered, are often 
considered as clay beds. The Niagara is a very extensive formation, but its shales 
are much more persistent and wide spread than its limestone member in the east, 
but the limestone is more widely spread in the west. The gorge below the upper 
falls at Rochester is the best place to study these shales. In an agricultural point 
of view, this formation, like all limestones, is an admirable one. There is no better 
soil than that of the Niagara about Rochester, New York . 

A silico-argillaceous limestone, in New York, forms the beds of passage from 
the soft shale below to the purer limestone above . It is of a dark or bluish color 
when freshly exposed, but soon changes to light gray or ashen. These beds of 
passage are succeeded by a dark bluish gray sub-crystalline limestone, of a rough 
fracture, and separated into thin courses by dark shaly matter. The third member 
is a coarse grained concretionary mass, in irregular layers, exhibiting a very peculiar 
contorted appearance, as if much disturbed while in a semi-fluid or yielding 
condition. The concretions often present cavities lined with crystals, or contain 
the remains of some organic body. This is the surface-rock in West Avenue hi 
Rochester. 

The Niagara limestone is the great limestone which, in Wisconsin, occupies 
the peninsula between Green Bay and Lake Michigan, and then stretches southward 
to the south limits of the state, and far into Illinois and Indiana. It will be noticed 
hi looking over the Guide, how many railroad-stations in the western states, just 
mentioned are on the 5 c. Niagara, and how very extensive the formation must be. 
Its general appearance is that of a regularly bedded brown or buff dolomite, with 
occasional intercalations of beds of massive gray limestone. The quarries of 
beautiful buff limestone at Athens and Joliet, Illinois, so much used in Chicago 
for building-purposes, are in this formation. At Joliet there is 40 feet in thickness 
of this buff and gray limestone. West and northwest of Chicago the Niagara 
limestone is highly charged with petroleum, which oozes from the stone, blackening 
the face of walls built of it. On Goat Island, at Niagara Falls, the petroleum 
is also seen on the limestone in small quantities. In Michigan it is a grey 
crystalline, rather fine grained, moderately fossiliferous, doloinitic mass, 218 feet 
thick on Green Bay. 

In Western Canada the upper part of the Niagara limestone contains peculiar 
fossils, and is called the Guelph, and in Wisconsin it is subdivided into the 
4 Guelph, 3. Racine, 2. Waukesha and 1. Mayville beds. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. &apos;&gt;: } 

This formation establishes the topographical distinction between the lower 
plain of Canada, in which lie Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay, and the upper 
plain of the United States, on which lie Lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan. 
Its terrace crosses Ontario, growing loftier as the thickness of the formation 
increases northwestward, until it becomes a range of limestone mountain-land, 
forming the peninsula between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. It is there broken 
down in a range of islands, and reappears as a peninsula, just mentioned, cutting 
off Green Bay from the western shore of Lake Michigan. 

The Niagara and other limestones above it, seem not to have been deposited in 
Pennsylvania between the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers, and in Middle 
Pennsylvania. While the limestones below it are well represented, the Niagara 
is wanting as a separate formation, and its characteristic fossils are scattered 
through the Clinton rocks. 

6. Salina, (Onondaga Salt Group.) This is an important group in the State 
of New York, containing all the gypsum and water-lime, and furnishing all the salt 
water of the salines of the city of Syracuse, which produce more salt in a small 
territory than any other in the world. Its soil is excellent for agricultural purposes, 
forming, with those south of it, including the Hamilton, the garden-region of the 
State of New York. The whole group is about 700 feet hi thickness, and is 
divided into five deposits, but there are no well defined lines of division between 
them, except the last two. 

1. The first or lowest is a red shale, showing green spots at the upper part of 
the mass. The great mass is of a blood red color, fine grained, earthy in fracture, 
with no regular lines of division, but breaking or crumbling into irregular 
fragments, and shows but little variation. In several localities the red shale shows 
numerous green spots, varying from an inch or less to several inches in diameter, 
which strongly contrast with the red ground on which they are placed. The green 
color is the result of a chemical change, the peroxide of iron being reduced to 
protoxide. This red shale is of great extent along the railroad, and presents a 
thickness of from one to five hundred feet, yet nowhere has a fossil been found 
in it, or a pebble, or anything extraneous, excepting a few thin layers of sandstone. 
The main line of the N. Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R. runs on the Salina formation 107 
miles, from Canastoja to Brighton, and nearly all of this distance on this lower 
or red shale portion. 

2. The second deposit is the lower gypseous shales, the lower part of it 
alternating with the red shale, which ceases with this mass. This second deposit 
consists of shales and calcareous slates of a light green and drab color, with 
alternations of different colored masses, red, green, bluish and yellow, with a 
little whitish and greenish sandstone, different colors predominating in different 
places. In this deposit gypsum occurs in fibrous masses, either reddish or of a 
salmon color, which colors are peculiar to this deposit. The quantity of gypsum 
in this second deposit is comparatively small, and it is unimportant in an 
economical point r.f vii-v,-. 

Both the second and third deposits are permeable to water, which cannot be 
obtained in any of the hills composed of them unless the wells are sunk to the 
level of the water-courses, a fact which explains the absence of all brine-springs 
above the level of the country. 



26 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

3. The third member of the Salina formation is the gypseous deposit, whicl 
embraces the great masses quarried for plaster or gypsum, consisting of twi 
ranges, between which are the hopper-shaped cavities, the vermicular lime-rock 
and other porous rocks. This is the most important deposit, not only on account o 
its plaster-beds, but because it is only in this deposit that we have positive evidenc 
that salt has existed in a solid state, and, therefore, the only source whence th 
saline springs of Syracuse could have been derived. The great mass of th 
deposit consists of rather soft yellowish or drab and brownish colored shal 
and slate, and of more compact masses which are hard, a brownish colo 
predominating. It is usually denominated a gypseous marl, being earthy an&lt;indurated, slaty and compact. Some of it when weathered, presents a peculia 
appearance, as of having been hacked by a cutting-instrument, with sora 
regularity. The gypsum does not appear in layers or beds, but it occurs in insulate&lt;masses, and it assumes irregular not globular forms. The dark color of the gypsun 
is owing to carbonaceous matter. In many localities there are two ranges o 
these masses or plaster-beds, generally separated by the vermicular rock and thi 
hopper-shaped cavities. There are two masses of the vermicular rock, the uppe 
one four feet thick, with large porous cavities, the lower one twenty feet thick 
with small pores. This vermicular limestone is a porous or cellular rock, resembling 
lava. It is dark gray or blue in color, and perforated everywhere with curvelinca: 
holes, but otherwise very compact. The holes or cells vary from microscopic siz&lt;to half an inch in diameter, the cells being very irregular, and communicating 
with each other, some being spherical, and the resemblance in structure to i 
porous lava is complete. Forms which are due to common salt have beer 
discovered in this rock, showing the presence of crystals of this substance, whicl 
were removed by solution. 

The most interesting products of the group are the hopper-shaped cavities 
which must have been produced by common salt, as no other soluble minera 
presents similar ones. They show conclusively that salt existed hi this thin 
deposit. When salt crystallizes, a cube first makes its appearance upon the surface 
of the brine, then similar cubes form around its border, being attached to its upper 
surface, near the edges, while it gradually sinks, and additional particles ar( 
added, forming another row of cubes upon the first range. This is many timei 
repeated, until the density of the mass formed becomes greater than the liquid, 
when it falls to the bottom. When examined, being turned upside down, ii 
shows a pyramid of regular steps, terminated by a cube, and when its position it 
reversed it presents a form like the hopper of a mill. Where two ranges of plastei 
beds are seen the hoppers occur between them, and between the two massses o1 
vermicular rocks, and are from one inch to three inches and more hi diameter, 
These hopper cavities are formed hi the gypseous marl, or in the more solid part* 
of the vermicular rock. Testaceous animals cannot live in water saturated witl 
gypsum, hence no fossils are found in the deposit. No trace of rock-salt in New 
York has met the eye of any one, but the existence of it is a matter of nc 
doubt.* The fact of the difficulty of obtaining water in the gypseous hills, in 
either the second or third deposit, show there is little probability of finding sail 
above the level of the waters on account of its having long since been dissolved 
See Note 27, New York, as to the salt- wells at Syracuse. 

* After the above was written, rock-salt was first found, in June 1878, in a boring south ol 
Rochester. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 2? 

The &apos;&apos;Old Road,&quot; or the division of theN.Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R., from Syracuse 
to Rochester, via Auburn, runs on the gypseous portion of the formation, and the 
plaster-beds can be inspected at Marcellus station, close to the railroad, but the 
best gypsum quarries are on Cayuga Lake, just north of Union Springs, the masses 
being from fifteen to twenty-five feet thick. Sulphuric acid springs, and numerous 
sulphur springs occur in the State of New York, in the Salina formation, oftep 
rising through the crevices of the overlying Water-lime group. 

4. The fourth or succeeding portion of the Salina formation, consists of those 
rocks which show groups of needle-form cavities, placed side by side, caused by 
the crystallization of sulphate of magnesia, and presenting a finely striated columnar 
appearance. The rock is a dark gray or drab colored, impure limestone, with 
cavities containing crystals and often embracing shaly beds. It appears to be a 
magnesian limestone, its usual color is a brownish drab, also dove color, and it 
breaks with an earthy fracture. 

The Salina formation extends westward across Canada, and the salt-deposits 
of Qoderich in Ontario are in it. Six large beds of rock salt have been found there 
in boring, measuring in all 126 feet in thickness, at from 1,027 to 1,385 feet hi depth 
from the surface, the beds measuring from 6 feet to 35 feet each in thickness. 

The salt-deposits and brine-springs of the world are by no means confined to 
the Salina formation ; on the contrary, they are found in almost all the formations 
from the oldest to the youngest, and always accompanied by gypsum and red and 
vareigated marls. 

5. The fifth division of the Salina or Onondaga Salt group is the Water- 
lime, which has generally been considered as belonging to the Lower Helderberg,, 
but which properly is part of the Salina. All the hydraulic cement of the State 
of New York, known as Rosendale Cement, and Syracuse or Manlius Water-lime, 
is manufactured from a portion of the stone of this Water-lime formation. It is 
an earthy, drab-colored limestone and usually consists of two layers of drab 
limestone, always separated by an intervening mass of blue ; it is easily recognized 
by its gray or ash color when weathered. It has a thickness of not less than 
30 feet, and often attains a thickness of 100 feet or more in New York. When 
the Water-lime is burnt the stone does not slake, if of a good quality. It is 
ground hi a mill, and then it hardens or sets when mixed with water, and remains 
so under water, its goodness depending on the hardness or cohesion when set. 
Its peculiar quality is owing to the proportion of silica and alumina it contains. 
The Water-lime continues across the State of New York, the drab layers which 
constitute it being always found. The courses into which the layers of Water- 
lime are sometimes divided show a crenulated or notched surface, like the sutures 
of a skull, the two surfaces interlocking each other. Professor Hall says the 
Water-lime is a distinct member, which does not belong to the 7. Lower Helderberg 
group of strata, but to that below it, the 6. Salina, of which it is the upper member. 
It is not closely related to either, but more nearly to the Salina, and is much more 
widely spread than the other members of the Salina. The cement quarries of the 
Delaware River, between Pennsylvania and New Jersey are hi this formation, but 
cease after passing the Lehigh River westward. The beds near Copley are Trenton 
or older. In Middle Pennsylvania, where the Salina group, destitute of gypsum 
and salt, measures 440 feet, the cement beds above measure 580 feet, and the 
Lewistown limestone (Lower Helderberg) 162 feet, as measured by Ashburner and 
Biilin, in 1876. 



28 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

7. Lower Helderberg. In consequence of these rocks being so well developed 
on the Helderberg Mountains, near Albany, New York, they have received that 
name. The Lower Helderberg series consists of five limestone sub-divisions, and 
the Upper Helderberg of four members. They are separated by an important 
sandstone formation the Oriskany. The Lower Helderberg, which is well 
developed in the eastern part of New York, thins out in going west, and at 
Syracuse disappears entirely. The sandstones also thin out and disappear, so that 
at Syracuse the Upper Helderberg rests on the Water-lime, the upper member of 
the Onondaga Salt group. The Lower Helderberg consists, in ascending order, 
of the 1. Tentaculite limestone, the 2. Pentamerus limestone, the 3. Delthyris shaly 
limestone, the 4. Encrinal limestone, and 5. Upper Pentamerus limestone. 

1. The Tentaculite limestone is the lowest member of the series. Portions 
of it afford fine building stone, which can be procured in blocks of large size, 
perfectly solid, and free from cracks or flaws. They vary from ash-gray to black, 
and present almost every shade between these colors. The strata are intersected 
by two main systems of joints nearly perpendicular to each other, hence the 
rock can easily be quarried in large blocks. But much of it is thin-bedded, 
often thinly laminated, dark blue ; its color, texture and composition contrast- 
ing strongly with the Water-lime below. H. The 2. Pentamerus limestone 
is rarely pure, being more or less mixed with black shale, which gives a dark 
color to the rock, it being usually a dark gray. It is crystalline in grain, and is 
in layers, but the lines of division are not straight, and the surface is not even. 
The whole mass has a rough appearance, and it does not make a good building 
stone. V. The 3. Delthyris shaly limestone, as its name implies, is a shaly mass, 
and consists of alternate beds of shaly and compact limestone. It is an exceedingly 
interesting rock from the great number of species, the abundance and perfection of 
its fossils. Hall, 144. The 4. Encrinal is a compact crinoidal limestone, and the 
5. Upper Pentamerus is a bluish gray limestone. In Pennsylvania, according to 
Rogers, the Lower Helderberg is 50 to 100 feet thick, a diversified calcareous 
formation, of some shade of blue, argillaceous and flaggy in its lower beds, and 
shaly towards the middle, with layers and nodules of chert. 

8. Oriskany Sandstone, In New York the greatest thickness of this rock is 
not more than thirty feet, and usually much less, but in Pennsylvania, Maryland 
and Virginia it is, in places, as much as 700 feet ; even in New York it covers an 
extensive surface, and is strongly marked in its fossils, which are generally of a 
large size, and attract the attention of travelers. At the typical locality, Oriskany 
Falls, the sandstone is twenty feet thick, and is of a light yellow color, friable, and 
readily crumbling into pure sand ; no part of it being sufficiently solid for durable 
work. One characteristic of this rock is the abundance of small cavities, which 
have been formed by the destruction of fossils. These present themselves in all 
cases where the rock is well developed. The porous nature of the mass has 
admitted the percolation of water, which has dissolved the calcareous matter of 
the shells, usually leaving casts of their internal stuucture. As a mass the 
Oriskany sandstone is a coarse, rather loosely cemented, purely silicious sandstone, 
of a yellowish white color. Sometimes it is shaded brown or some other dark color. 
In Pennsylvania it forms rough ridges, with a poor sandy soil. It is used for glass- 
making, and contains an iron-ore too silicious to be valuable. Some of our geologists 
(Hall, Rogers, Dana, etc.) place the Oriskany at the top of the Silurian series, 
and others (Newberry, Lesley, Hunt, etc.) at the bottom of the Devonian.

9-12. DEVONIAN AGE. 

9. LOWER DEVONIAN. 

9 Upper Helderberg or Corniferous. This very widely extended formation 
consists of four important members, the Cauda-galli, the Schoharie grit, the 
Onondaga limestone, and the Corniferous limestone, the upper member. But 
in the recent text-books on geology the whole formation is called the Cornif- 
erous, which was the name given by Eaton to the whole formation of limestone. 
It forms the Helderberg range, a high ridge which extends through the State of 
New York, forming a very rich and productive tract of country. This group of 
strata, as above limited, and designated the Upper Helderberg by Professor James 
Hall, is, in his opinion, deserving of recognition as the base of the Devonian, the 
Hamilton group being the middle, and the Portage, Chemung and Catskhl the 
Upper Devonian. 

9 a. Cauda-galli* This is a fine-grained calcareous and argillaceous sandstone, 
usually drab and brownish, and blanching by long weathering. It readily strikes 
the eye by its contrast with its associated rocks, and by the singular marking of 
impressions strongly resembling the tail of the common barn-yard fowl, from 
whence its Lathi name of Cauda-galli or cock&apos;s-tail. Its fossils have been found 
in New York and at Crab Orchard, in Kentucky. In New Jersey, northeast of the 
Delaware Water Gap, this and the Schoharie are three hundred feet thick. 

9 b. Schoharie Grit. This is very much like the preceding, but altogether 
different in its fossils. It is a fine-grained, very calcareous grit, or an arenaceous 
limestone, naturally brown, but weathering to a gray or drab color, containing a 
great number of fossils peculiar to this stratum, and is found in the mountain 
one and one-half miles northwest and northeast of Schoharie, New York, and 
extends by the Helderberg range to Kingston. The Schoharie Grit is a highly 
fossiliferous formation, and has a wide geographical extension. Its great number 
of cephalopods gives it a marked character, but it contains other fossils identical 
with the limestones above. H. 

The 9 c. Onondaga Limestone in New York rarely exceeds ten to fourteen feet 
hi thickness, but is very persistent, and is readily recognized by its light gray color, 
crystalline structure, toughness, and its numerous organic remains. This is one of 
the most valuable building stones in the Helderberg division, and has been largely 
quarried near Syracuse for the canal. It is an imperishable stone, having great 
power to resist the action of air, water and frost. It is generally the rock over 
which the water flows at the water-falls on the Helderberg range, as at Perryville 
and Chittenango Falls, and is remarkably uniform in its character. It is more 
extensive than the Corniferous proper, and it is very rich in beautiful and char- 
acteristic fossils. The limestones used for flagging in Syracuse are Onondaga 
limestone, brought from the typical localities Onondaga Valley and Split-Rock 
on Onondaga Hill. When wet they make a fine display of fossils of this 
formation. This stone is also used for building everywhere in Central New 
York. 



30 

9 d. Corniferous Limestone. For all practical purposes, this and the Onondaga 
limestone may be regarded as one formation. It extends from the Hudson River 
to the Niagara River, which it crosses at Black Rock, producing there a rapid 
current at the International Bridge, at Buffalo, and forming, a small island just 
above the water. It extends far into Canada, is seen at Sandusky City, Ohio, and 
there forms the bottom of Lake Erie. Its color varies from a light grayish-blue 
to a black, and is sometimes even a light gray or drab. It contains numerous 
nodules of flint or hornstone, from which it derives its name. But few if any of 
the layers afford a pure limestone. Its color varies from black to gray, brownish 
and light blue. It is usually in regular courses from six to eighteen inches thick, 
separated by layers of hornstone, and sometimes embracing flattened nodules of 
the same. This rock is crossed by vertical joints in two directions, giving rise to 
numerous copious springs of water. An upper division, called the Seneca limestone, 
is now included in the Corniferous . In New Jersey and Pennsylvania it is a blue 
and sometimes sparry limestone, including bands and nodules of chert. In Canada 
and the Western States it is a straw-colored and light gray rock. In its general 
eastern exposures it is generally bluish. Above the Corniferous are no general 
limestone masses in the Eastern States, but partial deposits only, the most ex- 
tensive of which is the Tully limestone, found only in Central New York. There is 
an astonishing change from the top of the Corniferous limestone to the black 
shales of Marcellus. Two formations more unlike cannot anywhere be found. 
Both the Corniferous and Onondaga are included in the Upper Helderberg lime- 
stone of Pennsylvania, and on the Juniata they measure together only sixty feet. 
Immediately upon the upper surface of the Corniferous limestone, lies the valuable 
and extensive MARCELLUS IKON ORE. This consists of carbonate of iron, which 
occurs in a bed of pyritous clay, and near the outcrop is changed into limonite. 

10. MIDDLE DEVONIAN. 

10 a, Marcellus Shales are of a black color, usually dark brown when 
altered. They greatly resemble the Utica slate in mineral character, and could 
readily be mistaken for it. They extend in New York from the Hudson River to 
Lake Erie. The lower part contains some impure black limestone, not in layers 
or beds, but in interrupted flattened masses. The upper shales are not so highly 
colored as the lower ones, and are disposed to separate, when long exposed, into 
small, thin-edged fragments, the result of a peculiar accretionary structure. The 
fragments often exhibit stains, in spots, from iron rust, and also minute crystals 
of gypsum, the effect of the action of decomposed pyrites and limestone particles. 
Some portions of the lower shales are black and friable from small carbonaceous 
f ucoids. Along the whole line of its outcrop it has been dug into in vain attempts 
to find coal. Van U. 147. It has two joint planes, nearly at right angles to each 
other, causing projecting corners of rock, with smooth nearly vertical surfaces. 
These are sometimes seen in the upper members also of the Hamilton group, and 
the septaria or flattened balls of black limestone also occur in the Genesee shales. 

The lower part is very black, slaty and bituminous, and contains iron pyrites 
in great profusion. In general character the lower part resembles the Utica slate 
and is not distinguishable from the 10 c. Genesee slate, in its general aspect. When 
long exposed, the lower part weathers to a brownish or iron-rust color, partly 
from the presence and decomposition of iron pyrites and partly from bituminous 
matter. In some situations it retains its purely black color, and scarcely separates 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 31 

into thin laminae after long exposure. In many places this rock contains so much 
bitumen as to give out flame when thrown upon a fire of hot coals. In Western 
New York it is fifty feet thick, and farther east much thicker. H. 

This important formation carries its broad black outcrops across many of the 
Middle and Southern States, with comparatively little change, but in the South the 
black shale is supposed to be Genesee. In the Juniata region of Pennsylvania 
the Marcellus has been found to measure 875 feet thick, and is there divisible 
into an upper, middle and lower member, the last consisting of black and brown 
shales, the surface being stained with iron rust,&amp;c., coated with bituminous 
matter. In Perry County, Pennsylvania, small coal beds occur in this formation, 
constituting the oldest known coal-measures, and significantly marking the great 
change in the general condition of things which either followed or was introduced 
by the deposit of the Oriakany sandstone. Lesley. 

In speculating upon the origin of petroleum, dome geologists have sought it 
in a process of distillation from the black Marcellus and Genesee shales upward, 
and of condensation in the oil-bearing gravels and fissures of the overlying 
formations. Chemists, like T. Sterry Hunt, oppose this view on chemical grounds, 
others oppose it from other considerations of apparently equal weight. It is a 
curious fact, however, that at this horizon, and hi the Upper Helderberg or 
Corniferous, occur the petroleum deposits of Upper Canada, while the Pennsyl- 
vania oil-deposits lie at successively higher and higher stages hi the series. 

10 b. Hamilton. This group takes its name from the town of Hamilton, hi 
Madison County, New York, which contains no other rock, and where the best 
opportunity exists of examining the members of which it is composed, and where 
its fossils are in great abundance. It includes all the masses between the upper 
shales of Marcellus, and the Tully limestone, and is from 300 to 700 feet hi 
thickness in New York. It is important from its fine agricultural qualities, its 
thickness and extent, commencing at the Hudson and extending to Lake Erie. 
It consists of slate, shale and sandstone, with endless mixtures of these materials, 
or, hi other words, sandy shale and shaly sandstones, and is not very easily 
described. There are three distinct mineral masses as to kinds, but not as to 
arrangement. The first, in the order of the tenuity of particles, is rather a fine 
grained shale, often fissile or slaty, its color some shade of blue, usually dark or 
blackish. The second is a coarse shale, often mixed with carbonate of lime, its 
color blue or dark gray when fresh, but becoming of an olive or brown color by 
long exposure to the weather, the color being due to manganese. It has no tendency 
whatever to separate into regular layers, but when a mass has been long exposed it 
shows numerous curved divisions, the curves very short and irregular, giving it a 
very peculiar appearance, which is unmistakable. The third kind, which is not so 
common as the two first, is a well characterized sandstone, and is generally in thr 
upper part of the group, but more or less mixed with either of the two others. It 
is often in layers, though rarely straight, and usually short, interrupted, sometimes 
mixed with carbonate of lime. The colors of this kind are of more various 
shades, olive, greenish and yellowish. One thin layer produces excellent flagstones, 
but the group generally is deficient in building materials, the shale of the first kind 
readily crumbling by exposure to the air ; the two latter kinds alone furnishing 
building stone. The best is where limestone forms the cement, and sand is hi the 



THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND -BOOK. 



greatest abundance. So rare is the occurrence of regular layers in the group, 
that their absence is a good negative character, and its brownish or yellowish 
color, externally, or where weathered, a good positive one of the group generally. 
This applies to the central, but not to the eastern part of the State of New York. 
It abounds in fossils, and is admirably characterized by them, numerous species and 
even genera commencing with the group, and ending with it. Van U. 150. 

In the western part of the State of New York, instead of sandy shale and 
shaly sandstone, and even tolerably pure sandstone, as in the east, the sand has 
diminished and the clay increased. The group, as a whole, presents an immense 
development of dull olive, bluish-gray calcareous shales, which, on weathering, 
assume a light gray or ashen tint, some thin portions becoming brownish on 
exposure. The formation thins out very much in going westward, and at Lake 
Erie has only half the thickness found at Seneca Lake, and is so different that 
doubt of the identity of the two might arise, if one judged by the appearance only. 
The Hamilton is the New York lake formation, the folio wing lakes being excavated 
in it: Otsego, Cazenovia, Skaneateles, Otisco, Owasco, Cayuga, Seneca, Canandaigua, 
and the north end of Hemlock Lake. The east end of Lake Erie is also cut out of 
the Hamilton. The upper part of the Hamilton was called the Moscow shale, 
from a place between Mt. Morris and Rochester, on the Genesee River. 

In Pennsylvania the Hamilton shale has been measured on the Juniata, 635 
feet thick. It has many hundreds of miles of outcrop, in repeated zig-zags, form- 
ing, in combination with the Genesee and Portage above it, ranges of smooth, 
cultivated hills, of an entirely characteristic shape, in long lines of ruffled slopes, 
regularly indented with short and smooth ravines. This striking topographical 
feature, maintains itself throughout the mountain-region into Virginia, and still 
farther south. The abundance of shells, without limestone beds, in Pennsylvania, 
furnishes a partial clue to the deposit of the (next succeeding) Tully limestone in 
New York. 

10 b. Tully Limestone. This is the dividing line, easy to find, between the 
Hamilton and Genesee, being the upper part of the former, and it is important in 
New York as the most southern mass of limestone in the State. It is only local, 
and is an impure limestone, fine-grained, usually a dark or blackish blue, often 
brownish. The usual thickness of the rock is about fourteen feet, and its greatest 
thickness twenty feet. It makes a good but not a white lime. It receives its name 
from the township of Tully, in Onondaga County, New York. This limestone 
often shows an accretionary structure, and a roughed, notched appearance, where 
its layers separate as in sonic of the layers of the water-lime. One of the lower 
layers is thick, the bottom one being frequently five feet in thickness, and it is 
owing to this circumstance, and to the softness of the shale beneath, that when- 
ever a waterfall exists, the shale has been washed out to some depth, leaving a 
chamber or cavern, of which the limestone forms the roof or ceiling. V. 169. 
It is a marked geological horizon in Central New York, being the termination 
of the Hamilton, and is succeeded by shales of a widely different character. 
It is often thick-bedded, but it is often divided by numerous irregular seams into 
small fragments. Its color, on first exposure, is blue or nearly black, but weathers 
to an ashen hue. It is best seen on the Cayuga Southern R. R., where it stands out 
in the face of the cliffs as a prominent band. It is absent west of Canandaigua 
Lake and in the eastern part of the state. H. 212. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 33 

10 c. Genesee, (Black Slate of the west and south). This is a great 
development of argillaceous fissile black slate. Where its edges only are exposed, 
it withstands the weather for a great length of time, and often presents mural 
banks in the ravines, river-courses, and upon the shores of lakes. When the 
surface of the strata is exposed it rapidly exfoliates in thin even laminae. On 
disintegration it is often stained with iron, owing to decomposition of pyrites, but 
hi many instances, and the greater number of localities, it retains a deep black 
color. In this it is distinguished from some beds of black slate in higher 
situations, which always become stained with hydrate of iron on their edges, 
and upon the surface of the laminae. In color and general character it greatly 
resembles the Marcellus shale, and, aside from position, it would be difficult to 
distinguish the two, in the absence of fossils. It forms no conspicuous feature in 
the scenery or topography of the general surface. In ravines, and river and lake 
banks, it is usually seen in connection with the rocks below or above. Its greatest 
development, and a point where it appears more prominently alone, and the typical 
locality from which it was named, is at the opening of the gorge of the Genesee, 
at Mount Morris, where it is seen in the perpendicular cliffs for more than a mile 
hi length. See note No. 112, New York. Another great exposure of the 
Genesee slate is along the Cayuga Southern Railway south of Ludlowville, where 
it shows from eighty to one hundred feet thick, with the Tully limestone 
below and the Portage shales above it. See note 83, New York. The mass 
decomposes much less rapidly than the soft calcareous Hamilton or Moscow 
shales below it, and the thin slaty laminae resist atmospheric action a long toe. 
In lithological character it is entirely uniform, having, from Cayuga Lake to L^ke 
Erie, the&quot; same deep black color and laminated slaty structure, nor is there any 
change in its organic remains. Its fossils hi Indiana are precisely identical with 
those of New York. Hall 218. 

There are few formations in Central New York of which the limits are so well 
defined as this, lying between the Tully limestone below, and the sandstone flags 
of the base of the Portage group, above. It may also readily be found by the 
black color and slaty fracture. This shale has been regarded as the main original 
source of the petroleum in the oil region of Ohio and Western Pennsylvania, but 
there is reason to believe that part, at least, of the supply of these regions has 
come from the Corniferous limestone below it, as maintained by Dr. Hunt. 

All through the western and southwestern states there is always found a 
BLACK SHALK, which is often the only representative of the Devonian rocks. 
This is generally considered to be 10 c. Genesee. It is very remarkable that a 
formation of its composition, of so inconsiderable a thickness, and otherwise so 
unimportant, should be so widely extended, and retain throughout its character 
unchanged as a black shale. The researches of Dr. Newbery in Ohio tend to show 
its fossils to be of the Portage type. It is there 350 feet thick, and he pronounces 
it to be the equivalent of the Genesee and lower Portage. All the divisions of the 
Hamilton group, Marcellus, Hamilton and Genesee, are converted, by exposure, 
into a deep soil of an excellent quality for agricultural purposes, sometimes quite 
hilly, but f orming smooth land free from stones. Some of the finest wheat-growing 
and hop-raising land in New York is on the Hamilton, and its rich shales have 
been carried south by drift and diluvial agencies, and spread over the Genesee, 
Portage and Chemung, greatly to their improvement. 



34 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 



11-12. UPPER DEVONIAN. 

11 a. Portage. This group represents an extensive development of shales 
and flagstoneSj and finally some thick-bedded sandstone towards its upper part. 
It is extremely variable in character at different and distant points. In New York 
the Portage rises sometimes in a gentle slope, and at other times abruptly from 
the softer shales below. Between the deep north and south valleys, hi which the 
railroads run, the enduring sandstones of the upper part extend far northward, 
presenting, on the north side, a gentle slope, while on the east and west sides of 
the same hills, the slope is abrupt, the valleys being bounded by steep hills. The 
change in the external appearance of the country indicates the commencement of 
these Portage rocks, although they are not seen. Throughout the Hamilton shales, 
the valleys present gently sloping sides, and the country rarely rises far above the 
valley bottom. But on approaching the northern margin of the Portage group, the 
railway traveler sees a gradually increasing elevation of the hills on either side, and 
an abruptness in their slope, and in a short time finds himself in a deep valley 
bounded on either side by hills rising 400 or 500 feet, and in some instances, even 
800 feet above the bed of the stream. These elevations often extend several miles 
unbroken, except by the deep ravines which indent their sides. The higher sand- 
stones of the group, and in many instances the intermediate ones, produce falls in 
the streams which pass over them, and some of the most beautiful cascades in the 
State of New York, and many of the highest perpendicular falls of water, are pro- 
duced by the rocks of this group, and in none others do we meet with more grand 
and striking scenery. J. Hall&apos;s Report. 

The pedestrian often finds his course impeded by a gorge of several hundred 
feet in depth, such as Watkins Glen and Havana Glen. The Portage upper, middle 
and lower falls are 66, 110 and 96 feet, and between the middle and lower the 
rocks rise hi perpendicular cliffs 351 feet in height. See note No. 110, New York, 
as to Portage on Erie Railroad. Taghanic, Hector, and Lodi falls are also in the 
Portage. These points afford some of the grandest views of scenery, and 
admirable facilities for geological investigations. The lower division of the 
Portage is the 1. Ohasaqua shales, a green shale, with thin flagstones, and sandy 
shale. 2. The middle portion is the Oardeau shale and flagstones, a great 
development of green and black slaty and sandy shales, with thin layers of 
sandstone, from which are quarried beautiful and durable flagstones. The 
rocks of this part of the group form high, almost perpendicular, banks on the 
Genesee. In a westerly direction the sandstones disappear, and the shales increase. 
8. The upper part of the Portage consists of the Portage sandstones, thick 
bedded sandstones, with little shale, while below, the sandy layers become thinner, 
and shale beds more frequent ; still it must be acknowledged that there is no abrupt 
change from the beginning of the Portage to the top of the Chemung. In the 
Portage, the sandstones and shales are less separated than above, and the sandy 
strata are finer grained, and contain more lime than in tbe Chemung. Towards the 
southern extremity of Cayuga and Seneca Lakes, the Portage rocks form cliffs of 
considerable height, which present alternating hard and soft layers, and the 
numerous vertical joints present the appearance of solid walls of masonry, in 
distinct and regular courses. The vertical joints are well seen hi Havana Glen. 
Isolated masses, like huge columns, are often seen, standing out in bold relief 
from the line of the cliff, being the remains of previously exposed surfaces, which 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 35 



had crumbled away. On the Genesee River the group is not less than 1000 feet 
thick. The Portage yields less lime to the soil than the Hamilton, but for 
pasturage it is superior to it. H. 224. The great dairy-country of Cortland, and 
other counties in Central New York, is on the Portage formation. The water of 
the Portage group is remarkably pure and soft. The Portage rocks have not been 
recognized in the eastern part of New York. In Ohio the Portage forms the upper 
part of the Huron shale, and the lower part of the Erie shale, of Dr. Newbeny. 

In Middle Pennsylvania, according to Lesley, the Portage flags are 1,450 feet 
thick, and the Chemung shales over them, 1,860 feet thick. It is very hard to draw 
a line of demarcation between them, but, as a whole, the Chemung strata are 
more silicious and the Portage more argillaceous. The Portage sandstones are 
flaggy, and, at times, very shaly, and their alternations with shale frequent, the 
individual beds being thin, and the shales predominant. The Chemung sandstones 
are more massive, ferruginous and micaceous, with fewer alternations of shale. 
Brachiopods and other shells are abundant in the upper Chemung shales, while the 
Portage rocks are almost destitute of animal forms except crinoids and fucoids. 
Fucoidal impressions are also very abundant in the upper Chemung, and to the 
decomposition of this abundant marine vegetation, Lesquereux and others ascribe 
the origin of the petroleum, at its various local horizons, from the Portage up to 
the Mahoning sandstone hi the Coal Measures. 

11 b. Chemung. These rocks can everywhere be described as a series of 
thin-bedded sandstones and flagstones, with intervening shales, and mixtures in 
various proportions of these, and very rarely beds of impure limestone, resulting 
from the aggregation of organic remains. The whole series weathers to a brownish 
olive, and even the deeper green of the shales assumes that hue. The shales vary 
in color from a deep black to olive and green, with every grade and mixture of 
these. The sandstones are often brownish-gray or olive, and sometimes light gray. 
More generally, however, there is a tinge of green or olive pervading these strata. 
Towards the upper part of the group, in some localities, there is a tendency to 
conglomerate, and in a few places the mass becomes a well denned pudding-stone, 
with sometimes 150 t 200 feet of Chemung shales and sandstones above it. 
Towards the upper part of the group the shales are reddish, coarse and fissile, 
with much mica in small glimmering scales. Hall 251. From their red color 
these have sometimes been mistaken for the Catskill formation. 

In a few localities hi Pennsylvania it contains a very excellent variety of iron 
ore. As a general thing, however, this formation, and all others above it, up to 
near the coal conglomerate, are singularly deficient in iron ore. There is little of 
geological interest throughout the whole extent of the Chemung group. The N. 
Y. L. E.&amp;W., or Erie Railway, runs for 300 miles west of Susquehanna on this 
formation, and on nearly the same portion of it. In the northwestern portion of 
Pennsylvania the celebrated OIL REGION is in the Chemung, the oil being found 
stored-up in certain coarse porous sandstones, but these are merely the repository 
of the oil originating in lower strata. It is a very extensive formation hi Southern 
New York, all the southern tier of counties, west of Great Bend, being covered 
by it, and it forms an excellent grazing and agricultural country, not quite equal 
to the Portage, but much superior to the Catskill. In Northern Pennsylvania this 
formation, as in Southern New York, consists of a vast succession of thin layers 
of shale, of every hue, from a deep olive and dark green to a light slaty gray, 
alternating with thin beds of brownish gray sandstones. 



36 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

In Pennsylvania, ninety feet of strata have been carefully studied and measured 
on Sideling Hill, consisting of alternate beds of red and olive shales and sandstones 
with Chemung fossils, ripple-marks and f ucoids, and a bed of iron ore long known 
by the name of the Larry&apos;s Creek ore, which outcrops everywhere along the face 
of the Allegheny Mountain. In the gaps at Blairsville and Connellsville, hi 
Southwestern Pennsylvania, Prof. Stevenson finds Chemung fossils in what have 
always been called the Catskill rocks, on account of their being of a red color, 
and other geologists have made the same observation in Northern Pennsylvania. 
In Southern New York, adjacent to Pennsylvania, Professor Hall reports 150 feet 
of red rocks, and then thin gray rocks above with Chemung fossils. 

The Erie shale of Ohio is the equivalent of the 11 b. Chemung, and the upper 
part of the 11 a. Portage. At Cleveland, it consists of green, gray and blue shales 
soft and fine, with sheets oi micaceous, silvery sandstone, from half an inch to two 
inches in thickness, and flattened masses of argillaceous iron ore. Newberry. 
The formation also occurs in Kentucky, and Chemung fossils have been found in 
Utah and Nevada by Clarence King and Arnold Hague. 

12. Catskill, There is no observable line of demarcation between the 
Chemung and Catskill. The first sign of change is a more solid or hard rock 
appearing, often accompanied by red sandstone or red shale. The group consists 
of light colored gray sandstone, usually hard ; of fine-grained red sandstone, red 
Bhale or slate ; of dark colored slate and shale, of grindstone-grit, and a peculiarly 
accretionary and fragmentary mass, appearing like fragments of hard slate 
cemented by limestone, similar to what is well known in England as cornstone. 
The hard gray sandstone often presents a highly characteristic structure, the 
layers, one or more inches thick, being disposed in oblique divisions, the divisions 
usually overlapping each other. This peculiar angular arrangement presents 
altogether a singular conformation, and forms a highly picturesque rock. V. 
You can see this at Ralston, Pennsylvania. 

The prevailing color of the sandstone is brick-red, though often it is lighter, 
and sometimes of a deeper color, from a larger proportion of iron, while the 
coarser parts are often gray, and the shales are green. Beds of green shaly 
sandstone are interstratified with the red friable sandstone, and these are succeeded 
by a compact kind of conglomerate rock. The formation expands, and augments 
in thickness, in passing eastward, till it finally rises in the high and prominent 
peaks of the Catskill Mountain, nearly 4,000 feet above the sea, from which the 
formation derives its name. See note No. 9, of New York. 

The formation extends from this locality southwestward into Pennsylvania, 
where its outcrop, 3,000 feet thick, in combination with that of the Pocono 
sandstone above it, 2,000 feet thick, forms a terraced mountain, which surrounds 
each of the Anthracite coal fields ; the red rocks of the Catskill making the terrace, 
and the white rocks of the Pocono forming the crest. Piled upon one another in 
inclined strata, they constitute the bulk of the Catskill Mountains in New 
York, of the Pocono plateau in Pennsylvania, and the Allegheny, Savage and 
Cumberland Mountains, far into Virginia and Tennessee. 

)n all the railroads approaching the anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania 
one passes over these Catskill rocks, often for many miles. They contain no coal, 
but fossil ferns are abundant in some localities. This is the last and upper forma- 
tion of the Devonian period, and is the foundation on which rests the carboniferous 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 37 

system. On the Delaware division of the N. Y. L. E.&amp;W., or Erie Railway, is 
an opportunity of seeing the red rocks of the Catskill formation for a number of 
miles, and also on the N.Y.&amp;O. Midland Railroad north of the Bloomingburgh 
tunnel. 

In Pennsylvania it is composed of a vast succession of thin-bedded red and 
gray sandstones, with thin seams of red, green and mottled shales, also coarse and 
fine sandstones of various hues of red, brown, gray and greenish ; together with red 
and greenish coarse silicious conglomerate of white quartz pebbles, the whole being 
thick bedded, and with an oblique laminated structure. It has not much of 
interest, either to the scientific or practical inquirer. Its most interesting fossils 
are fish-remains, which, in the Catskills, extend through 100 feet in thickness of 
strata. It is the Old Red sandstone of England, lying under the coal. The 
English New Red sandstone is over the coal, being the Permian, Jurassic and 
Triassic formations, but these are not found directly over the coal hi America. 

The Catskill formation is a poor one for agricultural purposes. The fields are 
stony, with many projecting ledges of red rocks. Its sandstones are too hard, and 
too destitute of lime to produce a fertile soil, and the country covered by it is either 
a wilderness, or very thinly populated. 



13-15 CARBONIFEROUS AGE. 



13 a. Lower Sub-Carboniferous, To a superficial observer, the remarkable 
substitution of great sandstone and conglomerate deposits, under the coal-measures 
in the east, for generally limestone deposits, under the coal-measures of the west, 
must seem inexplicable. But the simple explanation is, that all the sub-carbon- 
iferous sand-beds of Pennsylvania, formed near the old continent, thin away, and 
gradually disappear, before they reach the Mississippi ; while the five great sub- 
carboniferous limestones of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, formed hi a deep quiet 
sea, on the contrary, thin away, in going eastward, to 40 feet in Westmoreland 
County, and 25 feet in Somerset County, Pennsylvania ; and totally disappear 
before reaching the Schuylkill and Lehigh Rivers. But the same limestone 
deposits thicken southward to 600 and 1,000 feet in Virginia, and even more in 
Tennessee. 

In the Pennsylvania Anthracite country, the next formation above the Catskill 
is a gray sandstone, called by Prof. H. D. Rodgers the Vespertine. In the second 
geological survey, Prof. Lesley calls it the Pocono, from the name of the mountain 
bounding Wyoming Valley, on the south side. The miners call it the second 
conglomerate. It contains carboniferous fossils, but no coal of value. Invariably 
the Vespertine is the outside mountain surrounding the coal-basins, the inside 
one being the 14 a. Pottsville conglomerate, or Millstone grit, and they are 
separated by 13 b. Mauch Chunk red shale, of Lesley, or Umbral, of Rogers, a 
soft rock, which forms a valley; and all four, 12. Catskill or Ponent, 13 a. 
Vespertine or Pocono, 13 b. Umbral or Mauch Chunk, and 14 a. Serai or Pottsville 



38 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAtfD-BOOK. 

In Pennsylvania, the Vespertine is a white, gray and yellowish sandstone, 
alternating with coarse silicious conglomerates, and dark-blue, olive and black 
slates, and occasionally thin beds of coal. In Michigan, it is the Marshall group, 
which is mostly a somewhat friable rock, with a reddish, buffish, or olive color, 
though in some regions becoming gray or bluish-gray. It forms the receptacle 
into which the brine descends, and accumulates from the next over-lying Michigan 
salt group, which is 13 b., and also sub-carboniferous. The Waverly group of 
Ohio is proved, by its fossils, to be of this same age. Its sub-divisions are given 
at the head of the chapter on Ohio. It produces the Berea grindstones and 
Waverly sandstone, the finest building-stone in Ohio, if not in the United States. 
In Tennessee there is a great development of the lower sub-carboniferous group, 
the 13 a. Barren group, and 13 b. Coral, or St. Louis limestone, formerly called by 
Prof. Safford the Silicious. Its upper part is the equivalent of the St. Louis lime- 
stone of Missouri ; the lower is a series of silico-calcareous rocks, characterized by 
heavy layers of chert, one inch to two feet thick. 

In Illinois the series of sub-carboniferous strata consists of the 1. Kmderhook 
group, 2. Burlington group, 3. Keokuk group, 4. St. Louis group, the base of 
which was formerly called the Warsaw limestone, and the 5. Chester group ; all of 
these are limestones and shale, with some sandstone in the first and last named. 
These embrace both the lower and upper sub-carboniferous, and are 1,200 to 1,500 
feet thick in the south-western part of Illinois, but thin-out in going north, and 
entirely disappear before reaching Rock Island, where the coal-measures rest on 
the Devonian limestone. In Iowa the four lower members occur, but the Chester, 
the thickest member, is wanting, and it is almost entirely wanting in Missouri. 

In Pennsylvania a small coal-bed has been opened on the Susquehanna River, 
in the Pocono sandstone ; and in Huntingdon County more than a dozen small 
layers of coal may be traced, running through the formation. In Montgomery 
County, Virginia, two similar coal-beds attain a local importance, being on Tom&apos;s 
Creek, respectively 4 and 8 feet thick. These represent the lower coal of East 
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. 

In Ohio the Subcarboniferous limestone extends through some of the south- 
eastern counties. It is quite thin, and represents only the upper or Chester member 
of the group. Two workable seams of coal the Jackson and Wallston coals 
are found below it. Newberry. 

13 b. Upper Sub-Carboniferous, In Pennsylvania this is the Umbral red 
shale of Rogers, and the Mauch Chunk of Lesley, sometimes 3,000 feet thick, and 
here consists almost entirely of very soft red shales and argillaceous red sand- 
stone, without fossils. It gradually becomes hi Virginia a triple mass of buff, green 
and red shales below, a thick body of light-blue limestone, full of fossils, in the 
middle, and the upper part blue, olive and red calcareous shales, with massive 
strata of gray and brownish sandstone. It contains beds of iron ore, which are 
sometimes very valuable. In the Western States the limestone is the principal 
rock. It is the limestone of Greenbriar Valley in West Virginia. In Northern 
Pennsylvania, gray and greenish shales, and gray argillaceous sandstones, are 
introduced among the red shales, and farther west it consists of two or more strata 
of soft red shales, separated by a thick body of gray, flaggy sandstone. It is 
generally well marked in Pennsylvania as the softest of rocks, or simply dry red 
mud, and is to be noticed by those in search of coal, none of which is ever

beneath the coal-measures. It is a heavy body of limestones and shale, the latter 
almost one-fourth of the mass ; and there is also a sandstone. See the above 
description of 13 a. in Illinois. 

In Middle Pennsylvania, around the Broad Top coal-basin, Prof. J. P. Lesley 
says there appears, for the first time in this formation, going west, distinct traces 
of the great mountain limestone formation, which underlies all the southern and 
western coal-fields, and becomes one of the principal features of the geology of 
the Rocky Mountains, as it is also of the geology of Europe. The red shale 
formation is here seen, divided in two 910 feet of it above, and 141 feet of it 
below ; a middle group of red and gray, mottled calcareous shales, and thin lime- 
stone layers, full of fossil shells in all 49 feet thick separating the upper and 
lower members of nearly pure red shale. 

The narrow red shale valleys, which surround this Broad Top coal-basin, the 
Cumberland basin in Maryland, and the three principal groups of anthracite basins 
hi Eastern Pennsylvania, are due to the thickness and softness of this important 
formation. But while it is 3,000 feet thick at Pottsville, it is but 300 feet thick 
along the Allegheny Mountain, and less than 100 feet thick around the coal-basins 
of Tioga and Bradford counties ; and, therefore, instead of making valleys, only 
marks the top of the mountain steep slopes with a narrow terrace, over which 
dominates the vertical cliffs of the outcrop of the coal conglomerate. 

14 a. Millstone Grit. This is a mass of white or yellow sandstone, containing 
vast numbers of quartz pebbles, and forming a pudding-stone, or conglomerate. 
It is called the Millstone Grit, from being used for the manufacture of millstones. 
In Pennsylvania and Virginia the formation is 1,000 feet thick, but becomes 
reduced to from 10 to 175 feet hi Ohio. In Kentucky it is from 50 to 500, and in 
Indiana from 50 to 100 feet. It is a very peculiar rock, and very wide spread, 
extending out beyond the coal measures proper, of which it is the base and support. 
There is not in the entire geological series, says Dr. Newberry, another stratum of 
rock so widely distributed, and presenting as strongly marked lithological characters, 
as this. The pebbles are generally of quartz, and well rounded. The sand, which 
forms the paste, and holds together the pebbles of the conglomerate, is generally 
coarse, and consists of rounded grains of quartz, which differ from the pebbles 
only in size. In the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, conglomerate rocks some- 
times occur between coal-beds, but in the other coal regions they are below all the 
workable coal-beds. Any cases of thin beds of good coal being found in or below 
the conglomerate, are exceptional and rare. It does not always maintain its 
character as a conglomerate, being sometimes an ordinary sandstone. The great 
lead mines of Joplin and Granby, in Missouri, are hi a ferruginous sandstone, the 
squivalent of the Millstone Grit, or the Chester group, and the Hot Springs of 
Arkansas are in the Millstone Grit, greatly metamorphosed. 

14 b. and c. Lower and Upper Coal Measures- The series of rock-strata, 
among which the carboniferous coal-beds are found, are called the Coal Measures, 
which produce all the best coal of America. They consist of repeated alternations 
of exceedingly diversified rocks, of every degree of coarseness, from the smoothest 
fire-clay to exceedingly rough, silicious conglomerates, including within those 
extremes a wide variety of coal-shales, or mud-rocks, of almost every color and 
texture marls, argillaceous sandstones and quartzose grits, also thin bands of 
limestones, both pure and magnesian, and numerous seams of carbonate of iron. 



40 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

The numerous coal-beds themselves, which occur among this series of strata, the 
most interesting and important of them all, are also found in America in all 
their known varieties, from the most compact anthracite to the most fusible and 
bituminous kinds of coal. There is no invariable order for the strata of coal 
measures, but usually the bed of coal has a fire-clay bed below it, and shale 
immediately over it. Extending our view over a considerable district, we find 
these rocks are coarser and more massive towards the east or southeast ; that 
they become more fine-grained, and less sandy and earthy, and the limestones 
increase in size and number as we proceed westward or northwestward ; that 
many of the strata become reduced in thickness, and some of them entirely dis- 
appear. In Pennsylvania and Ohio the middle portion of the coal measures con- 
tains no coal seams, and hence is called the Barren Measures, thus dividing the 
formation into Upper and Lower Productive Coal Measures. The Lower Coal 
Measures sometimes contain valuable beds of iron ore. Bait is produced from 
the Lower Coal Measures in Western Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois and Kentucky.* 

15. Permian. In the annexed Guide a large number of stations in Kansas 
are given as being on the Permo-Carboniferous (Permian) series, and it was for a 
long time supposed that these rocks occur only in Kansas. Prof. C. A. White has 
recently assigned a large area in Texas to the Permian, and Prof. I. C White is 
inclined to refer the Permo-Carboniferous beds of Southwestern Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia, the No. XVI. of Rodgers, to the same age, since they are the 
exact counter-part of the Texas rocks in their stratigraphical relations, lithology 
and palseontological affinities. The Permian rocks in Europe are limestones, 
sandstones, red, greenish, and gray marlites or shales, gypsum beds and con- 
glomerates, among which the limestones, in some regions, predominate. In 
Kansas they consist, according to Prof. Mudge, of calcareous and arenacous 
shales and beds of limestone. The latter are quite impure, but sometimes mas- 
sive magnesian limestone, of a drab and buff color, is found, which furnishes an 
excellent building material. Prof. Swallow describes them as a series of lime- 
stones, marls, shales, sandstones, conglomerates and gypsums. The State capitol 
of Kansas, at Topeka, is built of Junction City limestone of the Permian forma- 
tion. It is also used at Manhattan, and the buildings at Fort Riley are also con- 
spicuous specimens of Permian limestone. The rocks here called Permian, are 
conformable to the coal measures, and contain many coal-measure fossils, with 
some not found below. Some geologists think there is no good reason for sep- 
arating the Permian rocks from the Carboniferous system, of which they form 
the uppermost member (and in the Tables of Formations both Permian and 
Permo-Carboniferous are used.) Strata of the same age occur in Indiana, Texas 
and Mexico, where they contain many new and interesting reptilian remains. 
In most parts of the United States where the coal measures are not overlaid by 
the Permian beds, the latter have very probably been eroded. The Permian 
forms part of the New Red Sandstone of England, lying over the coal. The 
name is derived from Permia, a province in Russia.

the author&apos;s business led him to the study of geology, particularly in its economic bearings, and he

16-18. MESOZOIC. 



16, Triassic. As the railroads from Philadelphia to New York, the greatest 
lines of travel in this country, run&apos;on this formation, it is the most conspicuous 
and well known in the State of New Jersey, and one in which geologists are now 
taking great interest. Every observing person must have noticed it, and its aspect 
and composition are so uniform and well marked, that a description of it here will 
answer for the whole belt through the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, 
and North Carolina, from the Hudson River to Deep River, hi the latter State, and 
in the Connecticut Valley. 

The Triassic consists of dark reddish-brown sandstone, soft, crumbly brown 
shales, and the upper beds are coarse conglomerates. The almost invariable 
dip is towards the north-west, at angles ranging from 15 to 25&apos;. Prof. H. D. 
Rogers thought this uniform dip was not caused by any uplifting agency, but that 
the rocks were originally laid down in this manner. His theory is that the 
formation owes its origin to an extensive ancient river, having its source at the 
eastern base of the Blue Ridge, hi North Carolina. Following the remnants of 
the Triassic formation thence north-east, it gradually, from small beginnings, 
becomes larger, and has throughout a descending course. At the James River, it 
is four, at the Potomac six, at the Susquehanna twelve, and at the Delaware, 
thirty miles wide the estuary being in the region of the Raritan and the Hudson. 
In New Jersey, therefore, this river was at its maximum. 

The uniform dip was supposed by Prof. H. D. Rogers to be the result of the 
oblique or slanting mode in which the sediment has been laid down by a rapid and 
steady current washing the material from the south-east side or shore of the river. 
If it were due to an upheaval, this formation, measured hi the usual way, would 
show an unheard-of thickness. In fact, it is very thin, as is shown hi the exposures 
of limestone in the interior of the belt. All the appearances of the formation 
indicate, and there is much to sustain his opinion, that it never was tilted. 

But more recent study of this interesting formation, has proven two facts : (1) 
that it was originally extensive, far beyond its present limits ; and, (2) that, in at 
least its middle beds, the original deposits were horizontal, and have been since 
upturned. The two great belts of Triassic, which cross from Virginia into North 
Carolina, and one of them into South Carolina, not only have their rocks dipping 
in opposite directions, showing a long and broad uplifted country between Raleigh 
and Danville ; but certain groups of coal-beds, which, though now dipping in 
contrary directions, must of course have been originally horizontal. Traces of 
coal-beds have been found in the Triassic of Pennsylvania, In York county, and at 
Phrenixville. The intermediate country in North Carolina was, therefore, pre- 
sumably once covered with the formation, and probably all Virginia, east of the 
Blue Ridge, and all south-eastern Pennsylvania. The formation is seen passing 
under the plastic clays of New Jersey, and may extend far under the bed of the 
Atlantic, being thus connected with the beds of the Connecticut, and even those of 
ehe Bay of Fundy. Lesley. 



42 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 



Relics of vegetation are occasionally found in the Triassic, in the form of 
highly compact and bituminous lignite, the longitudinal sections exhibiting the 
fibrous structure of the wood, whence it was formed. This lignite, occurring 
sometimes in seams of two or three inches in thickness, amid dark shales, has 
been a fertile source of delusion, some persons having been induced by the hope 
of finding valuable coal-mines, to waste much labor in the search. Although the 
Richmond and North Carolina coals are Triassic, all the geological facts discoun- 
tenance the notion that it contains coal in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the 
detached fragments of plants, which we meet with in the form of lignite, having 
evidently been loosely drifted into these sediments from the land. Prof. Emmons 
says there is nothing which can be regarded as equivalent to the coal measures of 
the Chatham (N. C.) and Richmond (Va.) series in the northern beds. All this 
formation was produced at a period subsequent to the great Carboniferous or coal- 
bearing rocks. There are great numbers of fossil fish in the Trias of New Jersey 
and Connecticut valleys, among them twenty species of ganoids; also the famous 
bird-tracks of Dr. Hitchcock. See notes 27 and 28 Massachusetts. Fossil plants 
are numerous in the Trias of Virginia and North Carolina. 

When a large portion of the pebbles are of limestone, in the Triassic con- 
glomerate, and the cementing red earth which unites them, contains an adequate 
quantity of the same material, the rock possesses the character of a marble, as on 
the Potomac River. The Portland stone, or reddish-brown sandstone, so much 
used for building purposes in New York and other eastern cities, is from the 
Triassic formation. 

Extensive mines for copper ore have been wrought in the Triassic, hi the State 
of New Jersey, the ore occurring in every case adjacent to igneous traps, but not 
in contact with them. All these mining operations have failed, on account of the 
ore being diffused or disseminated through the mass of the formation, and not 
being found compacted hi regular veins. In Europe, the upper part of the 
Triassic is called Keuper, or copper. 

Trap Dikes. Numerous parallel ridges and dikes of Trap, some of them 
many miles in length, and with the elevation of mountains 400 feet high, and 
ridges of all sizes, traverse the Triassic. Indeed, nearly all the trap-dikes are 
confined to this formation. The material which composes these rough, rocky 
ridges, undoubtedly protruded in a state of fusion, slowly and gently through long 
narrow fissures, produced by the gaping asunder of the rocks, and not by 
enormous violent disruptions, like those of volcanoes, as the strata through which 
they passed are very little disturbed, and the dip of the strata is very little 
affected by them. These trap-dikes have burst through the red shale and sand- 
stone, after they were deposited, overflowing, while in a melted and highly heated 
condition, the adjacent beds, and greatly altering their texture, color and mineral 
aspect. The finest of these trap-dikes is the Palisades, on the west side of the 
Hudson River, above Jersey City, and extending north of that place. (See note 5, 
in chapter on New York). The tunnels and deep railroad-cuts through it, hi Jersey 
City, afford good opportunities to observe the appearance of the stone, the principal 
constituents of which are hornblende, feldspar, and titaniferous oxide of iron. 
The little mountain of iron ore at Cornwall, hi Lebanon county, Pennsylvania, was 
thrown up by a trap-dike of the Triassic. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 



That the trap is not confined, however, to the Triassic rock surface, is beauti- 
fully shown by the very numerous trap-dikes which cut the Highlands of Orange 
county, N.Y., and of New Jersey ; by the long, straight, narrow dike whicli issues 
from the South Mountain, opposite Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, and cuts across all 
the f onnations, from the Potsdam up to the Subcarbonif erous, at the mouth of the 
Juniata, (see notes 9, 77 and 170, in chapter on Pennsylvania), and especially by 
the still longer trap-dike recently discovered by Prof. Frazer, hi Lancaster county, 
Pa., which not only penetrates the Welsh hills of gneiss, but cuts across the west 
end of the Chester county (Pa, ) Valley, near the famous nickel mine, and reaches 
the Susquehanna River near the roofing slates quarries at Peach Bottom. Lesley. 

The Triassic formation yields the rock-salt and brine of the greater part of 
Europe, especially in England, Ireland, France, and part of Germany. 

17. Jurassic. The upper portion of what is commonly called the Triassic, on 
the Atlantic border, may belong to the Jurassic, and is so described by Prof. P. R. 
Uhler, in the annexed Guide for Maryland ; and by Prof. W. B. Rogers, as Juro- 
Triassic and Juro-Cretaceous, in Virginia. But there are beds which are 
undoubtedly Jurassic in several of the eastern ridges of the Rocky Mountains, and 
other districts of the far West. The rocks are, in general, a gray or whitish 
marly or arenaceous limestone, with occasional pure compact limestone beds, 
intercalated with laminated marls. The enormous Dinosauri, recently obtained 
by Marsh and Cope from Colorado, are from the Jurassic. It is much less import- 
ant here than in England, where it is subdivided into the Liassic, Oolytic and 
TVealden. The name is derived from Mount Jura, in Switzerland. 

18. Cretaceous. The Cretaceous formation, along the Atlantic Coast and the 
lower Mississippi Valley, consists of a series of beds of strata, differing from each 
other ; but they are all earthy in form, consisting of beds of sand and sandy-clay, 
except at a few points, where the strata have been cemented by oxide of iron into a 
kind of sandstone, or conglomerate. In Texas it contains extensive beds of gypsum. 
In New Jersey it produces the lower two beds of green-sand, called marl, which is 
extensively used hi agriculture, the value of which is due to the potash and phos- 
phates which it contains. Ninety per cent, of it is a green silicate of iron and 
potash, the rest being ordinary sand, and it contains no lime. But in Wyoming, 
Utah, and Colorado, the Cretaceous attains a thickness of 9,000 feet, and its rocks 
comprise beds of sand, marlite, clay, loosely aggregated shell-limestone, or rotten 
limestone, and compact limestone. At the middle of the Cretaceous, lie the beds 
of plastic-clay, outcropping across New Jersey, from Trenton to Amboy, and of 
great importance to the fire-brick and pottery factories, as described in the Report 
of Prof. Cook, of New Jersey, for 1876. 

The name Cretaceous is from the Latin word for chalk, the chalk of England 
and Europe, being one of the rocks of this period ; but in this country it contains 
no chalk, except in Western Kansas, 322 miles west of Kansas City, where a large 
bed exists. It is within one mile of Trego station on the Kansas Pacific Railroad* 
and is found over a tract 125 by 30 miles. 

The Cretaceous formation, in the far West, passes upwards into a coal-bearing 
formation, several thousand feet thick, and covering on the upper Missouri River 
not less than 100,000 square miles in the United States, besides the portion of th 
belt extending into the British possessions. The area of other lignitic basins 
farther south, cannot be estimated, their width being unknown. Dr. Hayden 



44 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TBAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

regards this coal-formation as transitional, or Lower Eocene 19. Tertiary, and in 
the within Guide for Colorado it is called the Lignitic Group, lying between the 
Cretaceous and Tertiary. Mr. Lesquereux is of the same opinion as to its Tertiary 
age, but nearly all other geologists regard it as Cretaceous. 

In the annexed Guide for &quot;Wyoming and Utah, the formation is given at points 
where the coal is mined Carbon, Separation, Black Buttes, Point of Rocks, Rock 
Springs, and Evanston. All the coal now mined in Wyoming is&gt;according to the 
Guide, in the 18 d. Laramie Cretaceous, which corresponds with Hayden&apos;s Lignitic 
beds. Every division of the Cretaceous is said to be lignitic or coal-bearing, and 
may some day produce good coal. The Evanston beds are in the Laramie, but the 
Coalsville beds are probably hi the 18 b. Colorado Cretaceous. The Rock Creek 
coal may be 18 c. Fox Hill. A. Hague. There is no Carboniferous coal hi the far 
west. The difference of opinion as to the age of the Lignitic or coal-bearing group, 
arises from the fact of its lying at the transition point from the Cretaceous to the 
Tertiary, where, as is not unusual, the fossils of both are mingled ; and the con- 
troversy is as to precisely where the Cretaceous ends, and the Tertiary begins. 



I9-2O. CENOZOIC. 

19. Tertiary. The Tertiary formation of the Atlantic coast is wholly of an 
earthy character, without solid rocks, consisting of sands and sandy blue clays, and 
above these yellow and brown f erruginous sand ; also clays and sands imbedding 
extensive layers of uncemented fossil shells. But as we trace them south and 
southwest through the Southern cotton-growing states, it becomes more calcareous, 
consisting of lead-colored sandy clays, and whitish and bluish friable limestone in 
North and South Carolina and Eastern Georgia. West of that, the upper member 
consists of two limestone strata, the middle of sand and sandy marl, and the lower 
part of limestone and marl. H. D. Rogers suggests that on the Atlantic slope, 
opposite the Appalachian Mountains, the older rocks furnished only sandy and 
clayey sediments, and the Tertiary deposits composed of the ruins of the former, 
are of that character ; while farther west a wide expanse of limestones fills the 
upper valley of the Mississippi, and hence the Tertiary deposits bordering the 
Gulf of Mexico, and extending up the Mississippi River, are of a greatly more 
calcareous or lime-bearing character. The cotton-growing lands of the Southern 
States are chiefly Tertiary. In the central part of the continent, the Tertiary beds 
are lake sediments, or fresh-water deposits ; while on the west coast they are marine. 
The Tertiary, in the southern part of New Jersey, furnishes great quantities of bog 
iron-ore, but bog iron-ore is not peculiar to the Tertiary formation. The upper bed 
of the green-sand of New Jersey is Tertiary. In the far-west the Tertiary strata 
are hi a greatly more indurated or rocky condition than those of the eastern coast. 
The 19 a. Eocene consists of beds of clay and sand, with round ferruginous con- 
cretions and numerous seams and local deposits of lignite, according to Mr. Les- 
quereux. Also gray and ash-colored sandstone, with more or less argillaceous 
layers. The 19 b. Miocene consists of white and light drab clays, with some beds 
of sandstone and local layers of limestone. The 19 c. Pliocene is composed of fine, 
loose sand, with some layers of limestone, and contains fossil bones of animals, 
which are scarcely distinguishable from living species. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 45 

20. Quaternary. The materials of the glacial drift consist of vast accu- 
mulations of sand, pebbles, and bowlders, belonging invariably to rocks lying 
northward of their present positions, with beds of bowlder clay of great thick- 
ness, evidently brought from a great distance from the north, by causes quite dif- 
ferent from any now in operation, and which nearly all geologists now believe 
to have been glaciers. This material is spread over the whole breadth of the 
North American continent, down to 38 or 40 of latitude, with glacial flood- 
deposits farther south along the valleys ; and it is also spread, in the same way, 
over the northern part of Europe. Nearly every recently uncovered ledge of 
rock in the drift-covered region has its surface marked with the characteristic 
striae and furrows. These scratched, polished and grooved surfaces prove the 
former existence, according to Agassiz&apos;s theory, of an ice sheet, many thousand 
feet in thickness, moving across the continent over open level plains, as well 
as along enclosed valleys. When softer and harder rocks alternate, they are 
planed off to one outline or level, as if a rigid rasp had moved over the land, 
leveling all before it. On the contrary, on any surface where water flows, we 
find the softer materials have yielded first and been worn out, while the rocks 
will be left standing out, and show greater resistance. Glacial surfaces are 
highly polished, and are marked with scratches, grooves and deeper furrows. 
Sometimes the smooth surfaces are like polished marble, showing that the 
grinding material was held steadily down in firm, permanent contact with the 
rocky surface against which it moved, as is the case with the glacier. There 
are many deep ancient channels filled by the drift. 

The usual characteristic marks of glaciers extend, according to Agassiz, 
over the whole surface of the east half of the continent, from the Atlantic 
shores to the States west of the Mississippi, and from the Arctic sea to the latitude 
of the Ohio, about the 40th degree of north latitude. The glacier marks trend 
from north to south, with occasional slight inclinations to the east or west, 
according to the minor irregularities of the surface. The ice of the great 
glacial period in America, is supposed to have moved over the continent as one 
continuous sheet, over-riding nearly all the inequalities of the surface. The 
drift is spread in one vast sheet over the whole land, consisting of an indis- 
criminate medley of clay, sand, gravels, pebbles, bowlders of all dimensions, 
so uniformly mixed together, that in all parts of the country it presents a gen- 
eral similarity. The partial absence of stratification is one important charac- 
teristic of glacial drift. In the bowlder clays there is no arrangement of the 
materials according to size or weight, whereas in water the lighter materials 
are carried farther than the heavier ones and deposited separately. In glacial 
drift there are large angular fragments by which it may be distinguished from 
alluvium, and it retains the mud gathered during the journey, spread through 
its mass, while the water-rolled deposits are washed clean, and consist usually 
of well-rounded pebbles, and there are no scratches on the exposed surfaces of 
the solid rocks. 

The following general description of the limit of the drift is intended to 
show the approximate boundary between the glaciated and non-glaciated parts 
of the country. Although the margins of the different drift-sheets appear to 
form a single margin, because the sheets overlap, it must not be inferred that 
they are one and the same, or that they were formed at the same time, orneces- 



46 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

sarily by the same agency. The majority of active and critical students of the 
drift of the interior now believe in two or more glacial epochs not merely 
stages of retreat, but two or more independent ice incursions. Nor is it to be 
understood that the southern border is everywhere a moraine, in any special 
sense of the term. For more than half its extent across the country, there is 
no special aggregation of drift at the edge, and the precise method of its forma- 
tion in certain portions is yet an open question. 

Tn the northwestern corner of the United States, the margin of the great 
northern drift sheet unites or becomes confused with the local drift from the 
mountains, and it is impossible to say at present what is to be regarded as the 
margin of the great northern mantle. According to Dr. G. M. Dawson, there 
was a general southerly movement on the highlands of British Columbia. This 
appears to have penetrated to the basin of Puget Sound, but not to have reached 
the Columbia river. It seems also to have entered the northern edge of 
Washington Territory, near the northern elbow of the Columbia (Willis). It 
also penetrated into Idaho, as far as Lake Pend d&apos;Oreille (Chamberlin), and 
also the northern border of Montana. Local mountainous glaciation was quite 
extensive along the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains and some 
minor ranges. East of the Rocky Mountains, the limit of northern drift enters 
the United States from Canada at the foot-hills of the mountains (G. M. Dawson), 
and running southward to the vicinity of Fort Shaw, curves eastward crossing 
the Missouri river about 40 miles above Fort Benton (Chamberlin and 
Salisbury). Thence it courses eastward, crossing the Yellowstone about 60 
miles above its mouth, keeps north of the Northern Pacific railroad to within 
about 30 miles of Bismark (same authorities). Here it turns south, keeps in 
the vicinity of the Missouri river to Nebraska (Chamberlin, Todd), thence 
southerly to near the mouth of the Republican river (Todd, Mudge), thence 
easterly to the mouth of the Missouri river (Salisbury and Chamberlin). East 
of the Mississippi it forms a great loop, reaching nearly to the south end of 
Illinois (Worthen, Wright) ; swings north to the heart of Indiana (ibid) and 
south again into Kentucky (Sutton, Wright). Entering Ohio above Cincin- 
nati it trends undulatingly northeast, and enters Pennsylvania a few miles 
above the mouth of the Beaver (Lewis and Wright) ; thence it extends north- 
eastward into the State of New York, where, making a sharp curve, it again 
enters Pennsylvania in Potter county, and passes southeast to Belvidere, New 
Jersey (Lewis and Wright), and crosses that State with a northward arch to 
Perth Amboy (Cook and Smock). It traverses the whole length of Long Island 
(Cook, Smock, Upham) and appears on Block Island, Martha&apos;s Vineyard 
and Nantucket (Upham). The reader will understand that all south of the line 
described is unglaciated except local areas in the mountainous regions of the 
west, and possibly some in the Appalachians. From the Atlantic Coast to the 
Scioto valley, in Ohio, for the greater part, there is, on or near the margin, a 
well-marked terminal moraine, north of which lie other marginal moraines. 
From the Scioto valley westward, the margin of the drift is characterized by 
no sensible ridging of the nature of a terminal moraine, but terminates in a 
thin and often very attenuated edge. Eastward from the Atlantic shore, the 
edge of the glacial deposits is supposed to correspond with St. George&apos;s Bank 
and Sable Island Shoal, and to pass southeast of Newfoundland. 



DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FORMATIONS. 47 

In Europe the border limit crosses the southeast corner of England, south- 
ern Holland, southern Germany, passing near Dresden, and thence onward 
south of Warsaw and Moscow, in a sinuous course, embracing the center of 
European Russia, and curving around to the northeast, runs northward to the 
Arctic Ocean, west of the Ural Mountains. 

In no part of the United States are the phenomena of the drift displayed 
on a grander scale than in the Lake Superior region and on the northern 
borders of Wisconsin. Minnesota and Dakota are very deeply buried in drift. 
At the south side of Lake Superior, the drift is frequently 200 to 300 feet deep, 
and at the west end of that lake it is 300 or more feet thick, and it is 220 feet 
deep at Fargo, Dakota. The lower peninsula of Michigan is covered often from 
200 to 300 feet deep. 

To the southward the drift usually diminishes, and it becomes more evenly 
spread over the country. It is a singular fact that in the Galena lead region, 
at the corner of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, bounded by the Mississippi, 
Wisconsin, and Rock rivers, and in a considerable extent of territory north of 
it, no transported drift material can be found. The driftless region is 10,000 
square miles in Wisconsin alone, or one fifth of the area of the State. Ohio 
has a very complete series of drift deposits, and they have been well studied 
and described by Dr. Newberry. He has classified the drift deposits as follows, 
in the ascending order : 1st. The Erie clay, a blue or gray unstratified bowlder 
clay. 2d. The forest bed, consisting of a bed of soil, with timber, the remains 
of an ancient forest, found in Ohio, Indiana, etc., at various depths from the 
present surface. 3d. Lacustrine deposits, stratified sands and clays in northern 
Ohio ; yellow clay abounding with gravel, in southern Ohio. 

The Bluff formation along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers is a very pecu- 
liar and interesting one, resting upon the drift. It is of a slightly yellowish ash 
color, very fine, not sandy, and yet not adhesive. It makes an excellent soil, 
is easily excavated by the spade alone, and yet it remains so unchanged by the 
atmosphere and frost, that wells dug in it require to be walled only to a point 
above the water line, while the remainder stands so securely without support, 
that the spade marks remain upon it for many years. Road embankments 
and excavations upon the sides of roads stand like a wall. (See general note, 
Mississippi chapter and note on Vicksburg, Tennessee chapter.) The peculiar 
outline of the bluffs along the Missouri river is very interesting. They are often 
naked, entirely destitute of trees, and tower up from the river bottom-land, 
sometimes more than a hundred feet in height, and so steep in some places 
that a man cannot climb them, yet they are not supported by a framework of 
rocks, as other bluffs are, and not a rock or pebble of any size exists in them, 
except a few calcareous concretions where lime-water percolates through them. 
It is thought to be a lacustrine deposit, a shallow lake having, during the time 
of the Glacial epoch, occupied the whole of the basin of the Mississippi before 
the great rivers had cut their valleys down to their present depths (White). 
In Louisiana the bluff deposit contains three distinct groups of strata, the Port 
Hudson below, the Loess next, and the yellow loam above, and over this the 
alluvium and below them all the drift (E. W. Hilgard, F. V. Hopkins). 



48 THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TRAVELING HAND-BOOK. 

Earthy material brought together by the ordinary action of water is said to 
be alluvial, and the soil or land so formed is called alluvium or alluvion. 
Diluvium implies the extraordinary action of water. When the drift material 
covers the surface, of course it forms the soil, but in driftless regions the soil 
is an admixture of clay, sand, lime, etc., derived from the disintegration of 
the rocks beneath, with decomposed animal and vegetable substances. Where 
neither glacial nor alluvial action has taken place as in some parts of our South- 
ern States the rocks are converted into a deep and strong soil , having undergone 
a process of decay which has rendered them so soft, sometimes to a depth of 
20 or more feet, that they may be readily cut with a spade, although retaining 
all the veins and layers which mark their original stratification. Without 
having been broken or ground up, even the hardest rocks have quietly 
mouldered into a soft clayey mass, which, from its peculiar structure, has a 
natural drainage and possesses, moreover, great fertility. 

The most important of geological formations is the last of all, the soil. On 
this thin, superficial, earthly covering of our planet depends all the growth of 
all vegetation, and on that depends all terrestrial animal life. But whether 
the material forming the soil remains unmoved in the same spot where it was 
once a solid rock, or is transported bodily by a glacier, or carried from the 
hills into the valleys by running water, and moved from place to place by 
larger streams and rivers, it was originally derived from the rock formations, 
therefore the agricultural as well as the mineral resources of the country 
depend on this geology. 

This completes, in brief, the description of all that can be seen of the 
earth, classified in geological order, from the oldest of the rocks up to the sands 
which are now daily washed to our feet by the currents of the rivers and the 
waves of the sea. 



THE GEOLOGIST&apos;S TB^YELING HAND-BOOK. 49 



REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTIONS. 



Paleontologists will be disappointed in this introduction, from which that is 
omitted which seems to them the most important, and gives the most interest and 
significance to the subject, namely: the life which they find in the formations, 
and which serves so important a purpose in their identification and classification. 
But another book would have been required for that purpose, and it would have 
been useless without a large number of expensive engravings.* Paleontology is 
the province of all the text-books on geology, to which this work is a supplement, 
not a substitute. Its only object is to teach local geology. The descriptions were 
an after-thought, and they should be regarded as an attempt to present to the 
unlearned a first-lesson in geology, in the vernacular tongue, hi the hope that it 
may help on the cause of popular science. They have swollen much beyond the 
original design, which was definitions, rather than descriptions; but they will 
serve to show that paleontology is not the whole of geology, and that the 
formations are more than a mere cabinet of fossils. 

There are some things in the descriptions that are not accepted by all 
geologists. But the scope of the work did not permit any account of the con- 
flicting opinions on disputed points, or discussions of the history of geological 
nomenclature and classification. Whether the Oriskany sandstone should be placed 
at the base of the Devonian, or at the top of the Silurian ; whether Hudson 
River, Loraine, Nashville, or Cincinnati, is the best name for that formation ; and 
whether Cambrian should include one, or all, or none of the Lower Silurian 
formations, and similar questions, seem of less importance to the ordinary reader, 
for whom the descriptions are intended, than to the professional geologist. 

All kinds of geological tables are given, for, in accepting the valuable con- 
tributions of others on local geology, it was necessary to let them have their own 
way, in the chapters on their own States, in regard to the names and the arrange- 
ment of the formations. A common number, attached to them throughout the 
book, serves to identify the formations by whatever name they are called. 

The valuable part of the book is the Geological Railway Guide, the design or 
plan of which is original with the author, as it is believed nothing of the kind 
has ever appeared, in any language. It is the work of many hands, and the hearty 
thanks of every lover of the science are due to all those who have contributed to 
its pages portions of the multitude of facts, forming this index to the geology of 
all important places in the United States and Canada. The reader will never know 
the amount of time, patience, labor, and care that it has cost.

50 AN AMERICAN GEOLOGICAL RAILWAY GUIDE. 

ARRANGEMENT OF THE GEOLOGICAL RAILWAY GUIDE 

AND DIRECTIONS FOR USING IT. 



1. The railroads are arranged by states, and the states and territories are 
arranged in geographical order, with reference to the great lines of travel. But 
to find a railroad, the reader must depend on the index. Branches are placed after 
the main line, which is generally first given throughout without interruption. 

2. When stations are omitted for the sake of brevity, which is seldom the 
case, the lists being uncommonly full, their geology will be understood to be the 
same as that given at the stations between which they occur. If the geology of 
two adjacent stations is different, it is evident enough that there is a transition 
from one to the other formation, between the stations, but the change is often so 
gradual that the transition point cannot be precisely given. 

3. A few feet of difference in level sometimes carries the railway track 
to an upper or lower formation. Railroads, too, sometimes run across narrow, 
projecting tails, and scalloped points of a higher or lower formation, than that 
given in the Guide, but which it would occupy too much space to specify. Where 
too, the strata are disturbed and broken-up, all the formations cannot well be 
specified for want of room. In such cases the Guide serves only to show nearly 
where you are, the prevalent formation being given. 

4. The hills, bluffs and higher ground in view, are often of a different 
formation from that given on the railroad, but not always higher in the series. 
Their elevation is often due to the hardness of the strata, the softer rocks f orming 
the valleys, in which railways generally run. 

5. Keep in mind the succession of the formations, as shown on the Guide, 
and whether you are going from older and lower to younger or higher strata, or 
vice versa. Notice the changes in the scenery with the changes in the formations. 

6. When you come to a new formation, refer to the description of it, in the 
beginning of the book. But it is difficult to get a clear idea of the formations 
from even the best description. The reader must see them for himself, and these 
lescriptions are intended to assist him in identifying them, and to impress their 
character and appearance upon his mind, or to recall them to his recollection after 
having seen them. 

7. By a little close observation of the formations hi traveling, you will find 
that most of them have peculiarities of their own, by which you can always 
know them, but which, like the features or appearances of persons, cannot be put 
into words, so that another who has not seen them could also recognize them. The 
form of the summits and elopes of the hills, and the general aspect of the country, 
but especially the rock-cuts on the railways, and other exposures of the forma- 
tions, in quarries, and in the banks and beds of streams, should be closely 
observed ; and if these are not visible, notice the stone used in buildings, and for 
the enclosures of fields, the character of the soil, and the fragments of stone mixed 
through its mass, which betray the nature of the solid rock formation beneath ; 
observe also whether the rocks lie horizontally or in an inclined position.

1. The Dominion of Canada is, as a matter of convenience in this work, divided into four parts, and 
from a geological point of view such division is largely borne out by structural facts. 

I. The Maritime Provinces includes Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. 

II. Ontario and Quebec includes the provinces of the same names. 

III. Manitoba and so much of the Northwest Territory as is traversed by railway-lines forms the 
third division. 

IV. British Columbia, together with the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains (politically a part 
of the Northwest Territory) constitutes the fourth. 

For each of these great divisions a separate table of formations is given. 

For the purpose of enabling the traveler to provide himself with further information on geological 
points, the following notes on publications are attached : Dominion of Canada generally : &quot; Sketch 
of the Physical Geography and Geology of the Dominion of Canada &quot; with map ; Geological Survey, 
1884. For economic minerals see also &quot;Descriptive Catalogue of Exhibits at Philadelphia, 1876,&quot; 
And &quot; Catalogue des Minereanx Roches, etc.,&quot; at the Exposition at Paris, 1878, by Dr. B. J. Harring- 
ton. Both published by the Geological Survey. 

The &quot; List of Publications of the Geological and Natural History Survey, 1884, &quot;enumerates all the 
official reports and maps to date. 

I. MARITIME PROVINCES.&quot; Reports of Progress.&quot; Geological Survey. The whole of Cape Bre- 
ton Island, part of the mainland of Nova Scotia, and nearly the whole of New Brunswick have been 
ecologically mapped on contiguous sheets of uniform scale. Maritime Provinces generally : &quot; Aca- 
dian Geology.&quot; Sir W. Dawson. (With supplement and map.) 1878. 

The greater part of the really productive coal measures are included in the Province of Nova 
Scotia, the great spread of Carboniferous rocks in New Brunswick having so far been found to con- 
tain but thin, and, generally, scarcely workable, coal-seams. The deposits of the glacial period are 
often well shown in railway-cuttings, and extensive tracts are completely covered with these. The 
boulder-clay is the moet persistent and universal. Peaty deposits underlying the boulder-clay have 
been observed locally ; overlying the boulder-clay are stratified clays, sands, and gravels, and kames 
are frequent, particularly in New Brunswick. The stratified clays hold marine fossils in the vicinity 
of the coast of the southern and northern parts of New Brunswick. 

The island of Cape Breton affords good coal, and a number of collieries are in operation. As it is 
&apos;not yet traversed by railway, it does not receive notice in the body of this work, but few places of 
equal area are of greater interest from a geological or picturesque point of view. 

II. ONTARIO AND QUEBEC. &quot;Geology of Canada.&quot; Sir W. Logan. 1863. This work summar- 
I ices the main features to date, and is accompanied by an atlas of maps, sections, etc. Sir W. Logan&apos;s 
1 large map (25 miles to 1 inch, published 1866) includes, besides Ontario and Quebec, the Maritime 

Provinces and adjacent portions of the United States, and is much more detailed, for the region cov- 
ered by it, than the map accompanying the sketch of 1884. 

From 1863 reports in different portions of the provinces in annual &quot; Reports of Progress.&quot; See 
I also &quot; E*quisse Geologique du Canada,&quot; etc. 1867. 

III. MANITOBA AND NORTHWEST TERRITORY. In addition to the sketch of 1884, see reports and 
maps in annual &quot; Reports of Progress &quot; of Geological Survey, &quot; Report on Geology and Resources of 
4fch Parallel,&quot; by Dr. G. M. Dawson. 

Much information in the possession of the Geological Survey, but yet unpublished, is incorporated 
in the notes on these portions of the Dominion. 

IV. BRITISH COLUMBIA. In addition to the sketch of 1884, see annual &quot;Reports of Progress,&quot; 
j 1871, to date. A considerable portion of the province is covered by preliminary geological maps, on 
|J a scale of 8 miles to one inch. 

The jrreater part of the facts for the Dominion of Canada are derived from the reports and maps of 

the Geological Survey. Dr. G. M. Dawson also wishes to acknowledge assistance received from Dr. 

. Selwvn, the director of the Survey, and several members of the staff, especially Messrs. R. W. Ells, 

R. Chalmers, and H. Fletcher. The notes on the Intercolonial Railway are chiefly due to Sir W. 

Dawon, aa elsewhere mentioned.

2. These notes are extracted, with little alteration, from a chapter by Sir W. Dawson, in &quot; Hand- 
book for the Dominion of Canada.&quot; Published by Dawson Brothers, Montreal. 1884. 

3. Halifax. Quartzites and slates of the coast series, or gold series, of Nova Scotia, believed to be 
of Lower Cambrian ape. In the vicinity of Halifax and elsewhere it contains auriferous quartz mines. 
The nearest of these are situated at Montague and Waverly. The auriferous veins often also contain 
mispickel, and sometimes blend and other minerals. They run generally parallel to the strike of the 
inclosing rocks. The richly auriferous veins are seldom of great width, and the gold is sometimes 
disseminated also in the contiguous slate. The age of formation, of some at least, of the veins is sub- 
Bequent to the Carboniferous, as auriferous conglomerates of Lower Carboniferous age with derived 
gold occur, and have actually been worked, at Gay&apos;s River. At Northwest Arm and other places may 
be seen granite, which traverses these beds as thick dikes or intrusive masses, and produces con- 
tact metamorphism. At Waverly Mine the obscure fossil named Astropolithon may be found in the 
quartzite. 

4. Windsor Junction. Excellent exposures of the fossiliferous Lower Carboniferous limestones, 
and of the great beds of gypsum characteristic of that formation in Nova Scotia. 

5. Elmsdale. Beyond Gay&apos;s River, the railway enters the Carboniferous country, and in some 
places quarries in the Lower Carboniferous limestone may be seen near the road. 

6. Truro. At and beyond Truro, the railway traverses a portion of the Triassic red sandstones of 
Cobequid Bay. The sandstones may be seen in the cuttings, and the red color of the soil is character- 
istic. In approaching the Cobequid Hills, a more broken country, and beds of sandstone and con- 
glomerate indicate the Carboniferous beds, which here reappear from under the red sandstone. 

7. Londonderry. The road here enters a belt of highly-mclineri slaty rocks of olive- gray and dark 
colors, which, at a little distance west of the railway-line, contain large and productive veins of iron-

of iron and ankerite, with some specular iron, and has been changed in many places to a great depth 
into limonite, which is the ore principally worked. Beyond this place the slates are seen to be pierced

10. Springhill. Brines from Carboniferous, utilized on small scale in manufacture of salt, 21 miles 
from Sprmghill mines. A branch road leads to the mines of the same name, the most important coal- 
mines on this railway. Seven coal-seams, varying in thickness from two feet to thirteen feet six 
inches, are known in this district. The &quot; black seam,&quot; eleven feet thick, is that which has been most 
extensively worked. The mines supply the coal used on the railway. 

11. Maccan. Conveyance maybe taken from here to the South Joggins, on the shore of Chegnecto 
Bay, twelve miles distant. The section of the Carboniferous rocks on this part of the coast is one of 
the moet instructive in existence, and has been rendered classic by the writings of Sir W. E. Logan, 
Sir C. Lyell, and Sir W. Dawson. The section displays over 14,000 feet in vertical thickness of strata, 
extending from the marine limestones of the Lower Carboniferous to the top of the coal-measures, 
and includes seventy coal-seams, of which, however, only two are of workable thickness. Besides 
numerous fossil plants (including erect sigillaria), the beds here yield reptilian remains and land- 
shells. 

12. Amherst. Near here fine examples of the alluvial deposits of the Bay of Fundy ; more es- 
pecially the great marshes of Amherst and Sackville.

15. Moncton. From this point to near Bathurst the railway passes over the low Carboniferous 
plain of Northern New Brunswick, showing scarcely anything of the underlying rocks. 

16. Bathurst. Beyond this point is the varied and interesting country of the Bale des Chaleurs, 
and the Restigouche and Metapedia Rivers, of which it is possible only to note some of the more 
striking features. Three miles beyond Bathurst, line crosses doleritej intrusion 1 mile. A short dis- 
tance north of station good sections of leda clay and saxicava sand, with fossils. 

17. Petite Roche. From this station to Charlo^numerous massive intrusive bodies of dolerite cut- 
ting through the Silurian rocks. 

IS. Jacquet River. The Lower Carboniferous here forms a narrow fringe along the shore From 
Bus station to Dalhousie, many good sections of leda clay and saxicava sand, with fossils. 

19. Dalhousie. From Dalhousie the following localities may be visited : At Cape Bon Ami, near 
Dalhousie, a fine section of Upper Silurian shale and limestone, abounding in fossils, and alternating 
with very thick beds of dark -colored dolerite. Apparently resting on these are beds of red porphyry 
md breccia, forming the base of the Devonian. On these, a little west of Campbellton, rest a^&apos;lomer- 
Ite and shale, rich in remains of fishes (Cephalaspis, Coccosteus, etc.), and traversed by dikes of trap. 
Immediately above these, conglomerates and hard shales, the latter full of remains of Psylophyton and 
Arthro&lt;tirjma, and at a sandstone-quarry at the opposite side of the Restigouche, are similar plants, 
with great silicified trunks of ProtolaxUff. All these beds are Lower Brian or Devonian. At Scaume- 
nac Bay. opposite Dalhousie, are magnificent cliffs of red conglomerate of the Lower Carboniferous, 
and appearing from under these are gray sandstones and shales of L T pper Erian age. These contain 
many fossil fishes, especially of the genus Pterichthys, also fossil ferns. 

20. Metapedia. The rocks exposed about here are principally slates and shales with marked slaty 
structure, of Upper Silurian ase. Fine exposures in cuttings. Fossils occur in calcareous bands. 

Lake Metapedia. at the&quot; head of the river, the railway cuts through some limestone, probably 
of Hudson River age, and then passes into Lower Silurian, and probably, in part, Cambrian, shales, 
iandstones, and conglomerates, of which the greater part are referred to the Quebec group. At the 
mouth of Metapedia River leda clay and eaxicava sand, with fossils.

21. Little Metis. Cuttings in slates of the Quebec group. The Kiver St. Lawrence, here thirty miles 
wide, suddenly breaks upon the view after passing Metis station. Beyond this point the line follows 
the strike of the Quebec group all the way to Point Levis, opposite Quebec. 

22. Bic. Conglomerates here specially worthy of notice and well shown in cuttings. 

23. Point Levis. In cuttings on a new connecting railway, about a mile from the station, beds 
holding Graptolitet. 

24. The rocks on which the city of Quebec stands are believed to be of Hudson River and TTtica 
age, and fossils ( Oraptolites) lately obtained there confirm this view. The great Champlain and St. 
Lawrence fault cuts the north shore of the river west of Cape Rouge, and bending round, again cuts 
the shore immediately south of the city, and thence follows the channel of the river between Quebec 
and Point Levis. The falls of Montmorenci, near Quebec, are of great beauty, and show in the gorges 
Utica shale resting on Laurentian gneiss, which at the &quot;natural steps&quot; above the falls is overlain oy 
Trenton limestone. Half way between the city and the falls, at a mill in the village of Beauport, is a 
bank of boulder-clay overlain by fossiliferous sand and gravel (saxicava sand), rich in Saxicava ru- 
gosa and other shells. Clays with a somewhat richer fauna (upper leda clay) occur in the bank of a 
brook a little farther from the road to the north. 

25. Sussex. Brines from the Lower Carboniferous, employed to a small extent for salt-manu- 
facture. 

26. Moncton. Between this station and Salisbury, in cuttings and gravel-pits, leda clays and 
saxicava sands. 

27. Riverdale. The millstone grit series consists of sandstones and shales, often red, and con- 
glomerate, associated with dark-colored beds holding fossil plants and Naiadites, with a few under- 
clays and thin seams of coal (&quot; Acadian Geology &quot;). 

28. New Glasgow. In this vicinity several important coal-mines. The productive coal area, so 
far as yet proved, is about nine miles long by three and a half wide, with an area of twenty-two square 
miles. Though thus limited in extent, the seams are extremely thick. The most important of these are

the &quot; main seam &quot; and &quot; deep seam.&quot; The first has a thickness of thirty-eight feet six inches, and is 
capable of yielding at least twenty-four feet of coal of good Quality. The &quot; deep seam &quot; (one hundred 



and sixty feet below) shows seven feet eight inches of good coal with three feet six inches of shaly 
coal. The coals are bituminous, and yield, as a rule, a good coke. A material known as &quot; stellar 
coal,&quot; which is in reality an earthy bitumen, occurs near Stellartown. but is not at present worked. 



rferous, possibly nearly on the horizon of the coals. On the East River, above New Glasgow, important 
occurrences of iron-ore, limonite, specular iron-ore, and bedded hsematite. These have not been worked. 

29. Windsor. The Windsor series, or Lower Carboniferous limestone and gypsiferous beds, is a 
marine formation, holding characteristic shells and corals of the Lower Carboniferous period, and con- 
taining, in addition to the limestone, thick beds of sandstone, marl, and clay, usually red, and gypsum 
(&quot; Acadian Geology &quot;). 

30. Falmouth. The Horton series, or Lower Carboniferous coal measures, underlies the last, and 
consists of hard sandstones and shales, often calcareous, associated with conglomerate and grit, and 
in some places with highly-bituminous shales. It holds underclays and thin coaly seams, remains 
of plants, fishes, and entomostracans, and footprints of batrachians, but no strictly marine remains 
(&quot;Acadian Geology &quot;). 

31. Wolfville. From this point to Kentville the alluviums and marshes of the Bay of Fundy 
shores may be seen to the north. 

32. Kentville. Though marked Triassic to Annapolis, the line of the railway runs throughout near 
the line of junction of this formation with Silurian, Devonian (Oriskany), and intrusive granites, which 
form the hills to the south. To the northward is visible the continuous ridge of the North Mountain, 
which intervenes between the Cornwallis and Annapolis Valley and Bay of Fundy shore. This is com- 
posed of Triassic traps, which overlie the red sandstones of the same formation. Cape Blomidon (near 
Wolfville) is the eastern extremity of the North Mountain. In this lofty cliff (four hundred feet) col- 
umnar basaltic trap is underlain by amygdaloid, containing numerous zeolitic minerals. The base is 
formed of red sandstone with gypsum veins. The cliffs bordering the coast from Cape Blomidon west- 
ward afford many zeolites in fine crystals. 

33. Bridgetown. At Paradise, east of this station, fine crystals of smoky quartz derived from 
veins in granite. 

34. Carleton. This town is, like St. John, on Lower Cambrian rocks, but the railway immediately 
enters au area of Pre-Cambrian, and turning round northward passes into Lanrentian. 

35. Westfleld. Immediately beyond Westfield an outlyer of Lower Carboniferous one mile wide. Pre- 
Cambrian rocks then extend to Nerepis. which is on (or near) a very small Lower Carboniferous outlyer. 

36. Nerepis. Beyond this station Silurian H mile, followed by granite.

43 The whole of this island consists of Permo- 
Carboniferous and Triassic rocks, with general 
red color, which has also been communicated to 
the overlying drift and soil. The surface is rolling 
and generally drift-covered, so that it has so far 
been found impossible to separate the two for- 
mations above mentioned except quite locally. The 
remarkably interesting Triassic reptile Bathygna- 
thus borealis was found in the excavation for a well 
at New London. The soil of Prince Edward Island 
is remarkably fertile and well cultivated.

much frequented as a summer resort. Orford Mountain, a dioritic intrusion to the northeast. 

42. South Stukely. Numerous occurrences of copper-ore in this vicinity. The Huntington cop- 
per-mine six miles distant. The ore is chiefly chloritic slate and diqrite, impregnated with copper py- 
rites, pyrrotite, and iron pyrites. Magnesite forms enormous beds in Bolton and neighboring town- 
ships, in association with serpentine, dolomite, etc. Chromic iron also found in serpentine. (Bolton,

with, and though colored, provisionally, on the general map of the Geological Survey as Cambrian, 
may be Cambro-Silurian or Silurian. 

47. Bloomfleld. Exposures of fossiliferous Oriskany of Bear River and Clements near here. 

48. Digby. Good exposures of Triassic red sandstones and trappean rocks at Digby Gut and St.

IB extensively quarried. Water-power is employed to drive the polishing machinery. The stone much 
resembles Aberdeen &quot;granite,&quot; and is of very fine quality and color. 

52. Pennfield. Large, broad kame, or &quot; whaleback.&quot; 

53. Lepreaux. Anthracite of an impure character occurs in Devonian beds about four miles south 
of station. The anthracite is very impure, but is interesting, being the only known instance in America 
of a Devonian coal. 

54. Lancaster. Between this point and next station (Prince of &apos;Wales) line passes nearly along 
junction of Laurentian (to north) and Devonian. At Lancaster, kames. 

55. St. John. Few points are of greater geological interest than the vicinity of St. John, where 
within a radius of a few miles rocks occur which have been assigned to the Laurentian, Pre-Cam- 
brian, Cambrian, Devonian, and Lower Carboniferous formations. The city stands on hard, slaty 
rocks of the Acadian group, which yield Primordial fossils, in some places in considerable abundance. 
The Devonian rocks are well exposed on the shores of Courtney Bay. and also in the vicinity of Carle- 
ton. About a mile west of the last-named place, on the shore, are the &quot; fern ledges,&quot; which have 
yielded a great number of fossil plants, with some insects and crustaceans. The Devonian rests quite 
unconf ormably on the Cambrian series, and is again overlain unconformably by the conglomerates of 
the Lower Carboniferous. 

56. Weldon. Between this point and Hillsboro the Petitcodiac salt-marsh. 

57. Hillsboro. Gypsum quarries in the Lower Carboniferous rocks. 

58. Albert Mines. The mineral known as Albertite, an inspissated bitumen filling veins in the 
black shales of the Lower Carboniferous, was at one time extensively worked here. The mines are 
now closed. 

59. Curryville. Gray sandstone quarries. 

60. Shepody. Thence to Harvey principally salt-marsh. 

61. New Glasgow. (See note No. 28, under Intercolonial Railway.) 

62. French River. Lower Carboniferous in valley, hills on both sides of Silurian rocks. 

63. Marshy Hope. Opposite this point, on the coast, good exposures of fossiliferous Silurian 
rocks of Arigaig group. 

64. Antigonish. Interesting display of Lower Carboniferous rocks, including beds of limestone 
and gypsum in this neighborhood. 

65. Cape Porcupine. On the shore of the Strait of Canso, 500 feet in height. The central mass a 
red syenite, against which rest slaty beds, supposed by Sir W. Dawson to be Silurian. On these, con- 
glomerates of the Lower Carboniferous. 

66. Strait of Canso WTiarf . Interesting exposures of Lower Carboniferous rocks at Plaster Cove 
and other places on north side of Strait of Canso.

100. The portion of the province included between the 45th parallel and Maine boundary and the 
St. Lawrence, generally designated the &quot;Eastern Townships,&quot; has given rise to more discussion and 
difference of opinion between geologists than any other part of the Dominion. It is naturally a 
region of extreme geological complexity and disturbance, and can scarcely yet be considered as 
fully worked out. For a work like the present it is necessary, however, at least to denote the for- 
mations on one uniform system, whatever doubt may attach to the reference of some of them. For 
this purpose, Dr. Selwyn has kindly allowed the use of unpublished sheets, colored according to his 

This district is the continuation northward of the Appalachian region. One of its most salient 
features is the great Champlain and St. Lawrence fault, which separates the undisturbed rocks of its 
northwestern from the plicated beds of its southeastern part. This great fracture runs from the head 
of Lake Champlain to Quebec and beyond. (See Note 8, New York.) 

101. Lennoxville. The Hartford Mine, from which a great quantity of copper-ore has been ex- 
tracted, is situated at a distance of five miles from this station. The ore is granular iron pyritee, mixed 
with copper pyrites. 

102. Sherbrooke. Numerous occurrences of copper-ore hi this vicinity and near Lennoxville. A 
bed of jasper in the town of Sherbrooke. 

103. Richmond. The Rockland and Melbourne slate quarries are within a few miles of this sta- 
tion. The slates here have been somewhat extensively worked, and are unsurpassed in quality. A 
few miles south of Richmond, in Melbourne, fine serpentine marbles occur. 

104. Durham. The line between the Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian rocks is crossed at South Dur- 
3am. 

105. Acton Vale. A very productive mine of variegated and vitreous copper-ore, occurring in 
brecciated portions of a limestone-bed, was formerly worked here, but is now abandoned. Slate quar- 
ries also in this vicinity. 

106. St. Hilaire. Boloeil Mountain, one of the remarkable igneous protrusions which penetrate the 
flat-lying Silurian rocks of the St. Lawrence Valley, may be visited from this point. The mountain is 
partly composed of augite-syenite and partly of nepheline-syenite. An excellent summer hotel on the 
mountain. (See Note 210 on Mount Royal, Montreal.)

107. St. Hubert. Extensive peat-bogs in this vicinity, from which a considerable quantity of peat 
was at one time extracted and manufactured. 

108. Montreal, Richmond and Quebec. This road passes for the most part over an alluvial country, 
in general thickly drift covered, and little is seen of the underlying rocks, except in the neighborhood 
of Richmond. (See Note 103.) 

109. St. Johns. Pottery-works. Rough earthen-ware articles are manufactured from clay un- 
derlying the town. The clay is marine (leda clay), twenty-two feet in thickness, and covered by one 
foot of soil.

110. Shefford. The railway here passes close to Shefford Mountain, an intrusive mass described 
as a granitoid trachyte. A larger Inass of similar trachyte forms Brome Mountain to the south. 

111. Stanbridge. Bog-irpn-ore in considerable quantity in this vicinity. Formerly worked. 

112. St. Armand. The limestone belt between this place and Phillipsburg affords several varieties 
of marble of different colors. Some of these have been quarried. A black marble occurring a mile 
and a half southeast of Phillipsburg is particularly worthy of note. 

113. The line, for the greater part of its length, is at no great distance from the north bank of the 
St. Lawrence, and. owing to the depth of the drift deposits and alluvium, but little of the geological 
structure of the county can be seen. The outlines of the formations, as represented on the geological 
map of Canada, are somewhat uncertain for the same reason, and must at present be considered as 
approximations only. 

114. Three Rivers. The railway here crosses the St. Maurice, a river important from a lumbering 
point of view, and having a total course of about three hundred miles. The Shawanagan Falls, on the 
St. Maurice, twenty-one miles distant, one hundred and sixty feet in height. The falls occur over Lau- 
rentian rocks, and are very picturesque. On the river below the falls the Potsdam sandstones may 
be observed to overlie the Lanrentian. Extensive brick-yards at Three Rivers. 

115. Terrebonne. Quarries. Chazy limestone. Stone taken to Montreal in scows, and has been 
extensively need in enlargement of Lachine Canal. 

116. St. Maurice. Iron smelting, on a small scale, has been in operation here for one hundred and 
fifty years. The mineral employed is bog-iron-ore. 

117. Grand Piles. Navigation by steamer on the St. Maurice from this point northward, into the 
heart of the Laurentian country. 

118. Sherbrooke. (See Note 102 under Grand Trunk, Montreal to Portland.) 

119. Dudswell. About three miles northward, yellow and gray marbles capable of receiving a 
good polish, and highly ornamental. 

120. Garthby. Deposit yielding native antimony, antimony glance, and other minerals, five miles 
from Garthby, in South Ham, lot 28. range 1. Lot 22, range (north) 1, Garthby ; extensive deposit of 
iron and copper pyrites. 

121. Thetford Mines. Asbestos extensively worked. The veins occur in association with serpen- 
tine rocks, which here characterize a considerable tract of country. 

122. Broughton. The Harvey Hill Copper Mine, at one time extensively worked, but at present 
suspended, near here. Purple copper-ore, copper glance, and copper pyrites, occur in veins cutting the 
strata and beds conformable with the stratification. 

123. St. Joseph. On the Chaudiere River. Gold occurs in placer deposits in numerous localities 
in this vicinity. These deposits have been worked to some extent, but are as yet imperfectly devel- 
oped, as the auriferous alluviums are known to extend over an area of ten thousand square miles. The 
Kil^our nugset. found on the Gilbert River, weighed 5H ounces. A handsome brecciated marble f und 
on the Rivieie Guilliaume near here. 

124. Port Dover. Cornif erous limestones, with pores of corals frequently filled with petroleum. 
Epsonite? occur in limestones on the lake shore. 

125. Hamilton. A band of sandstone known as the &quot;gray band,&quot; and referable to the Medina 
formation, is quarried here and used in building.

126. Collingwood. The Utica shales may here be observed to overlap the Trenton. These shales 
were at one time distilled here for oil. 

127. Stanstead Junction. A considerable area of granite here, surrounded by dikes of the same 
material which penetrate the calcareous strata. The granite is excellent for building purposes. 

128. Brome. About four miles southwest, iron-ores (specular schists) at one time worked. (See 
Note 110 on Brome Mountain, under Central Vermont Railway, Shefford.) 

129. Sutton. Similar iron-slates to that above described in a number of places near here. 

130. Abbotsford. Yamaska Mountain to the southeast, an intrusive mass about three miles in 
diameter, is for the most part a micaceous trachyte rock. The southeastern portion is, however, a 
diorite. 

131. Rougemont. The intrusive mass forming the mountain of Rougemont is chiefly composed of 
olivine-diabase. This is one of a group of similar intrusions of which Mount Royal and Beloeil 
Mountain may be taken as typical.

132. Pointe Claire. Black River limestones in qnarry near station. Highly foasiliferous. Much 
of the stone for the piers of the Victoria Bridge wae quarried here. 

133. St. Anne. The west point of the island of Montreal is composed of Potsdam sandstone, 
which is seen in the immediate vicinity of the station. Just east of this a belt of Calciferous occurs, 
and here yield? some characteristic fossils. Scolithits Canadenns may be found in the Potsdam. The 
Potedam forms an anticlinal, and underlies the county for about eight miles westward, when it is fol- 
lowed by a second belt of Calciferous. On the opposite side of Lac St. Louis, at Beauharnois, six 
miles from St. Anne, Protichnites in sandstone quarries. 

134. Vaudrenil. In the seigniory of Vaudreuil bog-iron-ores occur in several places, particularly 

135. Lancaster. From this point to Cornwall the railway nearly follows the line of junction of 
the Calciferous and Chazy formations. 

136. Mille Roche*. Quarries in Trenton limestone affording good building-stone. Some beds, 
when polished, resemble black marble. 

137. Brockville. Cliffs on the river below Brockville show good sections of the Potsdam beds, 
and on the river, two and a half miles above that place, an outlyer of this formation occurs, the basal 
conglomerate of which may be seen resting on the Laurentian. In cutting of Brockville and Ottawa

Railway, blue boulder-clay overlaid by brownish clay. An important deposit of iron pyrites in Eliza- 
bethtown, near Brockville. Acid-works. 

138. Lyn. Potsdam sandstone of good quality for building. A portion of the stone for the Parlia- 
ment buildings at Ottawa was quarried here. 

139. Gananoque. Quarry of red syenite on island opposite this place. The stone takes a good 
polish and is used for monuments, etc. 

140. Kingston. Clays seen 
days , a series overlying the 7&quot; ! 
cuttings Silurian beds, congk 

tiftn gneiss. The Trenton (?) here affords good building-stone. Kingston is familiarly known as &quot; The 
Limestone City.&quot; A considerable quantity of apatite is brought out here from points in the vicinity 
of the Rideau Canal. 

141. Bowmanville. Quarry in upper part of Trenton limestone. 

142. Limehouse. Materials derived from the Clinton formation employed in manufacture of min- 
eral pigments. 

143. Acton West. Artemisia gravels thirty miles. 

144. Rockwood. Considerable display of upper part of Niagara limestone in this vicinity. From 
Rockwood the slope of the country westward is at about the same rate with the dip of the beds, 
so that on arriving at Guelph we should be nearly on the same horizon as at the first-mentioned 
locality. 

145. Guelph. Quarries in the Guelph formation yielding building-stone (dolomite) of a superior 
character. Casts of fossils. 

146. The portion of this province lying between the Great Lakes, and generally designated the 
&quot; Ontario Peninsula,&quot; is geologically an extension of the rock-series of the adjacent portion of the 
State of New York, its formations showing throughout a close correspondence to those of that State. 
The separation marked by the lakes and Niagara River is to be regarded rather as accidental than 
structural. The greater part of the surface of this portion of the province is heavily covered by depos- 
its due to the glacial period, of which local details sufficiently precise for mention in connection with 
the actual lines of railways are frequently wanting. 

These superficial deposits only are often seen for considerable distances along the railways. 

The boulder-clay, which is thick and almost universal, is overlaid by stratified clays (Erie clays), 
which have not been found to hold marine fossils. The clays with marine shells, which occur in the 
eastern extremity of Ontario and in the Ottawa Valley, are an extension of those of the Province of 
Quebec, elsewhere described. 

The Saugeen clays have been distinguished as an upper portion of the Erie clays, and are locally 
unconformable on them. They are brownish and calcareous, with beds of sand. North of Lake Huron, 
and between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River, the clays are overlain by the Algoma sands, of which 
the Artemisia gravels, covering a considerable area in the Ontario Peninsula, are possibly a local de- 
velopment. 

147. Widder. Near the station a cutting shows forty feet of the Hamilton formation. The rocfcs

are soft marly clays with thin limestone beds, and are highly fossilif erous, yielding Spirigera inucro-

148. Brantford. Erie clay used in manufacture of white brick. Artemisia gravels twenty miles. 

149. Paris. Gypsum quarried in a number of places in this vicinity. Two beds, each fonr or five 
feet in thickness, separated by four feet of shale. 

150. Seaforth. Salt-works. Brines from the Onondaga formation employed. 

151. Clinton. Salt found in boring at 1,180 feet. 

152. Goderich. In cliffs on the Maitland River, near Goderich, sections of Corniferous formation 
^-sandstones and limestones in some places fossiliferous. In 1865 brine was discovered at Goderich, 
in a boring made with the hope of obtaining petroleum. In the next three years several wells were 
sunk here and hi the vicinity, the salt being derived from the Onondaga formation. In 1867 Mr. Att- 
rill effected a boring of 1.517 feet, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount and character of the rock- 
salt which had been reached in some of the wells made before that date. This boring showed a total 
thickness of 126 feet of rock-salt in 520 feet of strata. Dr. Hunt conducted analyses of the specimens 
obtained, and proved that some of the beds are extremely pure. He calculates at 880.000 bushels to 
the acre, the yield of salt from the best white layer of ten and a half feet in thickness. The area under- 
laid by these salt deposits does not extend as far north as Teeswater, but appears to have a consider- 
able extension southward. Owing to difficulties met with in sinking a shaft to the rock-salt, the beds 
have not yet been worked, though a large quantity of excellent salt particularly suitable for dairy 
uae is manufactured from the brines. 

153. Brantford. (See Note 148 under Buffalo to G. and D.) Artemisia gravels thirty-five mitee. 

154. Chippewa. Base of Onondaga probably in this vicinity, but whole country covered by clays. 

155. Clifton. In the slope and precipice over which the Niagara Falls occur, the whole thickness 
of the Niagara formation is included. On Goat Island fresh-water sands are found overlying the 
boulder-clay, and on the Canadian side sixteen species of fresh-water and land shells have been found 
in similar sands. (See Notes 39 and 42 in New York.) 

156. Grimsby. Quarries in Niagara limestone and sandstone. 

157. Dundas. Close to station, on north side, a fine section of Niagara and Clinton. Quarries. Great 
thickness of Quaternary clays in this vicinity. North of the town a gravelly ridge or shore deposit 318 
feet above the lake. Brick-yards. 

158. Copetown. Summit of Niagara escarpment. 

159. Gait. Good exposures of Guelph formation with fossils. Quarries yielding magnesian lime- 
stone suitable for building. 

160. Preston. Good sections of Guelph formation. Foeeils.

161. Elora. Good sections of Guelph formation in cliffs seventy-five to eighty feet high. 

162. Walkerton. Good exposure of Erie and Sangeen clays at bend of river, on 28th lot of first 
range north of Durham road. The Saugeen clays are deposits locally developed and overlying the Erie 
clay. 

163. Kincardine. White and yellow bricks manufactured from drift clays. 

164. Petrolia. The best petroleum wells of Ontario are in this vicinity. Surface oil had been 
known to exist for many years, but was -first obtained by boring in 1860. The oil-producing region 
round Petrolia has an area of about eleven square miles. The surface is level, and consists of a bluish 
clay to a depth of about one hundred feet. Below this the borings penetrate about three hundred and 
eighty feet of dolomites, shales, and marls, to the most productive stratum, which is reached at a 
depth of four hundred and eighty feet. The borings at first produced flowing wells, but pumping is 
now necessary. Most of the oil is refined in London, Ont. It is supposed to originate in the Cor- 
nif erons formation. 

165. Cayuga. Extensive gypsum deposits about three miles from the town. The bed worked is 
about five feet in thickness. 

166. Tilsonburg. Petroleum has been obtained in this vicinity. 

167. Brantford. Erie clay used in manufacture of white brick. Artemisia gravel totrty-flve miles.

210. Montreal. The region about Montreal is one of much geological interest. The following 


formations are represented in the immediate vicinity of the city: Pleistocene, Lower Helderberg, 
Hudson River, Utica, Trenton.and Chazy. The Chazy is here about two hundred feet thick, and 



consists chiefly of limestone. Exposures may be seen north of the city, as on the St. Lawrence road, 
also at Caughnawaga, where there are extensive quarries. The Trenton is here about six hundred feet 
thick, and is composed of gray and blackish limestones for the most part. Good exposure?, with nu- 
merous fossils, in quarries at the Mile End and at Pointe Claire. At the last-named locality, Black 
River beds occur. At the Reservoir, and at many points in Mount Royal Park, limestones, also of 
Trenton age. but differing in appearance from those of the above-mentioned localities, are well shown. 
TheJThazy and Trenton formations of the vicinity supply most of the building-stone used in the city.

ersed by dikes of nepheline-basalt. The Pleistocene is here divided into 1. Boulder clay ; 2. Leda 
clay ; 3. Saxicava sand. The city being built on these deposits, frequent opportunities of examining 
them are obtained in excavations for drains, cellars, etc. They are in some places highly fossilif erous, 
and are well shown in some of the quarries at Mile End, where they overlie glaciated surfaces of 
Trenton limestone. Near C6te des Neiges village, a Pleistocene beach with marine shells at an eleva- 
tion of 470 feet. 

Mount Royal is an intrusive mass, composed principally of diabase, but toward the west end is an 
important and more recent mass of nepheline-syenite, which is well seen at the &quot; Corporation Quarry.&quot; 
Both the eruptive rock and the surrounding limestones are traversed by numerous dikes. (From 
&quot;Sketch of Geology of Montreal and Environs,&quot; by Dr. B. J. Harrington, in &quot;Hand-Book for the 
Dominion of Canada.&quot; Dawson Brothers, Montreal.) 

In Peter Redpath Museum, McGill University, good local and general geological collections. 

211. Lachute. The Palaeozoic rocks here form a narrow belt of flat country bordering the Ottawa 
River. The Laurentian highlands may be seen to the north of this part of the railway line, and gradu- 
ally approach the river. 

212. Papineauville. C6te St. Pierre, one of the best localities for Eozoon, is reached from this 
station. Twelve miles by stage to St. Andre, thence three miles to COte St. Pierre. 

213. Buckingham is the chief point of shipment on the railway of the apatite mined at numerous 
places within a radius of twenty to thirty miles. Large quantities of apatite may frequently be seen 
piled here. Extensive deposits of plumbago near Buckingham are not at present worked. 

214. East Templeton. This is also an important point of shipment of apatite. 

215. Hull. Within a few miles of Hull is an important deposit of magnetic iron-ore, which has 
been somewhat extensively mined and is exported. Also hydraulic limestone. (See note on Ottawa.) 

216. Ottawa. The Laurentides, but a few miles distant, belong to the lower and middle divisions 
of Sir William Logan&apos;s Laurentian system. These two formations, consisting chiefly of gneisses, 
granites, crystalline limestones, etc., are overlain unconformably by continuous and perfectly con- 
forniable series of sedimentary strata of the Cambro-Silurian system, embracing the Potsdam (of the 
Ottawa and Adirondack regions), Calciferous, Chazy, Bird&apos;s Eye and Black River, Trenton, Utica, 
and Hudson River formations. It was in these measures that the late Mr. E. Billings made his earli- 
est palseontological researches, and these have proved ever since, as then, to be a rich hunting-ground 
to the palaeontologist. There are extensive and varied deposits of marine clays and sands, gravels, 
boulders, etc., of Pleistocene age. The Leda clay of Green&apos;s Creek, Gloucester, six or seven miles 
from the city, abounds in nodules holding remains of the seal, fishes, insects, shells, and plants. The 
total number of species representing the fossil fauna and flora of this locality does not fall far short 
of three hundred. Brigham&apos;s Quarries, Hull, through which the Canadian Pacific Railway runs, are un- 
doubtedly the best Cambro-Silurian crinoid quarries in America. Deposits of magnetite, apatite, and 
baryta occur within a short distance of Ottawa. Both the Black River and Trenton formations yield 
excellent limestones for lime or building purposes, while the Chazy of Nepean afforded much of the 
material (sandstones) used in the erection of the Parliament buildings. Al)ed of hydraulic limestone 
occurring at the top of the Chazy has been worked and employed in the manufacture of the &quot; Hull 
cement.&apos; r (Note by Mr. H. M. Ami.) In Ottawa the museum and offices of the Geological Survey of 
Canada. Excellent collection of Canadian rocks, minerals, and fossils. 

217. Skeads. Most of the sandstone used in the construction of the Parliament buildings, Ottawa, 
was quarried near here. 

218. Pakenham. Pleistocene deposit, containing mixture of marine and fresh-water shells near 
Pakenham Mills, 266 feet above the sea level. 

219. Arnprior. Bluish gray-banded Laurentian marble somewhat extensively quarried near here. 

220. Pembroke. Excellent sections of Laurentian in railway cuttings for many miles west of this 
point. The rocks shown &quot;are for the most part highly characteristic red, gray, and dark-banded 



gneisses ; felspathic and hornblendic, and frequently garnetif erous and micaceous. There are also some 
large bands of gray and white crystalline limestone ; but none of these are exposed along the line of

the railway west of Mattawa, where it leaves the valley of the Ottawa River.&quot; (Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn, 
in &quot; Descriptive Sketch of Geology, etc., of Canada.&quot;) 

221. Sudbury. &quot; After passing the Wahnapite River bridge, the Huronian rocks commence, with a 
series of flinty felsites or felsitic quartzites, succeeded by dark-gray quartzose conglomeritic beds ; 
also massive crystalline diorites, red, fine-grained syenites, and a great variety of highly altered vol- 
canic agglomerates, felspathic and dioritic. (Ibid.) 

From Sudbury the Algoma Mills branch runs over Huronian rocks to the shore of the lake. The 
main line westward, to Port Arthur by the north shore of Lake Superior, will be hi operation soon. 
From Sudbury it passes for about seventy miles over Huronian rocks. Thence to within about fifteen 
miles of the Nepigon River the Laurentian is the most widely spread formation, though intersected 
by belts of Huronian and with extensive granitic and dioritic intrusive masses. On both sides of the 
Nepigon, rocks of the Nepigon series (Cambrian) are found, and are separated by a mass of intrusive 
granite only from the Animike rocks of the vicinity of Port Arthur. 

222. St. Jerome. The rocks of the Norian or Upper Laurentian may be seen here, but are more 
typically shown at New Glasgow village, six miles distant, and the present terminus of the railway. 

223. The numbers affixed to the Animikie, Keweenian, and Upper and Lower Potsdam, in the 
table on p. 58, are those used for convenience in this chapter, but are not intended to affirm the pre- 
cise correlation of these with other formations similarly numbered in adjacent states.

234. Port Arthur. Good geological headquarters for examination of Nepigon, Animike, and Hn- 
ronian series. Silver-mines in neighborhood and fine crystalline minerals. Attractive scenery. The 
formations assigned to the various stations on this line, from Port Arthur to Rat Portage, may in 
some cases be in error, as no geologically colored map showing the precise positions of stations is at 
present available. After leaving the Animike of the lake shore, the rocks are all Laurentian or Huron- 
mn, with intrusive granitic masses. Fine sections of the rocks of these series, and the dikes and veins 
traversing them, occur in numerous cuttings. 

225. Buda. The reddish color of the drift deposits, characteristic of the neighborhood of Lake 
Superior and northeast portion of Minnesota, ends about here. 

236. Rat Portage. On northern extremity of Lake of Woods good headquarters for excursions on 
lake, where Laurentian and Huronian rocks are displayed in almost continuous sections along the shores. 
Gold-mines. Lake extremely picturesque, with innumerable islands. Both west and east from Rat 



rocks 

traversed is as follows : Laurentian, Int. granite, Laurentian, Huronian, Laurentian, Huronian, Lau- 
rentian. 

227. Keewatin. Railway twice crosses boundary between Lanrentiau and Huronian between Os- 
tersund and this station. Here good opportunity of examining junction. 

228. Selkirk. Quarries close to station in Galena limestone. Fossils.&amp;. Winnipeg. The alluvium of the Red River Valley is a deposit of a former great lake of Post- 
Glacial age, which Mr. Warren Upham has proposed to name Lake Agassiz. The shore lines of this 
body of water may still be traced, at various levels, to the east and west of the valley. The lake must 
have received the waters of the Saskatchewan, and had its outflow southward to the Mississippi. The 
alluvial deposits are of great thickness, and consist above of silty or loess-like material ; below fre- 
quently of plastic clays more or less distinctly laminated. The upper layers make excellent cream- 
colored bricK. Alluvium completely conceals the underlying rocks in this valley ; but these are, doubt- 
less, for the most part Silurian limestones like those of Lake Winnipeg. 

230. Burnside. In 1874 a boring was carried out at Rat Creek, near this place, by the Geological Sur- 
vey. The following section was obtained : Blue clay, 70 feet ; sand, gravel, and stones, with water, 18 
feet ; white limestone (probably Devonian), 42 feet ; gray crystalline rock (Lanrentian or Huronian). 77 
feet. West of Burnside the country rises considerably, and this point may be assumed as the west- 
ern limit, on this line, of the Red River Valley alluvium. Not far west of this the edge of the Creta- 
ceous probably overlaps the old rocks found in the above-mentioned boring, but the whole surface is 
completely masked by drift deposits. (See note on Brandon.) 

231. Brandon. From Winnipeg to Brandon, alluvium and glacial drift, the latter consisting of 
boulder-clay overlain by stratified sands and gravels. The western edge of the alluvial plain of the 
Red River Valley is indefinite on the line of the railway, which follows the wide depression of the 
Assiniboine. To the southeast and northwest it is marked by the escarpment of the second prairie 
steppe or plateau, constituting Pembina, Riding and Duck &quot;Mountains,&quot; and the Porcupine and 
Basquia Hills. Sands and gravels connected with the western edge of &quot; Lake Agassiz &quot; may be ob- 
served in several places. The underlying rocks are completely concealed by the drift deposits, but 
the Cretaceous probably overlaps the Silurian and Devonian rocks of the Winnipeg basin a few miles 
west of Austin station. At Brandon the Assiniboine Valley itself is entered. It may be taken as 
typical of the wide trough-like valleys generally characterizing the rivers of the second and third 
prairie plateaus. Small exposures of Pierre shales (Cretaceous) in some parts of the Assiniboine Val- 

232. Moose Jaw. Observe the line of the Missouri COteau in the distance, to the southwest. 

233. Mortlach. From Brandon to Mortlach there are no exposures of the underlying rock in the 
vicinity of the railway, and over the second prairie plateau generally, these are seen as a rule only in 
the river valleys. To Mortlach, however, the whole plain is, with little doubt, based on the Pierre

shales of the Cretaceous. The boulder-clay, with overlying stratified drift, and fine alluvium marking 
sites of former lakes or ponds, cover the entire country. At or near Mortlach the increasing eleva- 
tion of the plain brings in the base of tiie Fort Union Laramie, but there are no exposures near the 
railway. No western limit is given for these beds, as their precise extent has not been determined. 
They do not, however, extend on the line as far as the Old Wives Lakes. They are well shown to the 
southeast on the Souris River, and there hold numerous seams of lignite. 

234. Secretan. At Secretan the drift hills of the Missouri C6teau are well displayed. The COteau 
&quot;belt, where crossed by the railway, is not so well defined as near the 49th parallel, but may be said to 
extend from Parkbeg station westward to a point four or five miles beyond Secretan. See Note 259. 

235. Morse. Between Ernfold and Morse a second line of C6teau-like hills is crossed. The Old 
Wives Lakes (saline) appear to occupy an interval between this branch of the C6teau and that above 
described. They have evidently at one time been much more extensive, and have no outlet. 

236. Swift Current. The Pierre shales (Cretaceous) are exposed on the stream a short distance 
north of the line, and in valleys 1J miles northeast from station. In general the deposits of Glacial 
period and subsequent alluviums only are seen near the line. 

237. Gull Lake. Sections of Fox Hill sandstones overlying Pierre shales in Cypress Hills, a few 
miles south of this station. The Cypress Hills constitute a remarkable plateau, which may be seen 
extending to the south of the railway for many miles east and west. It is capped by Miocene Terti- 
ary beds, of which the most characteristic is a conglomerate Jformed of well-rolled pebbles of the 
harder rocks of the Rocky Mountains. 

238. Walsh. The dividing-line between the Pierre shales and the underlying Belly River series 
probably passes between Forres and Walsh stations ; but, as elsewhere in this region, the rocks are 
generally concealed by the later drift deposits. 

239. Irvine. Half a mile south of station fine sections &apos;showing Pierre shales, with coaly layers 
near base, overlying Belly River series. Fossils. 

240. Medicine Hat. Good sections of boulder-clay and drift in railway cuttings to eastward. 

241. Stair. One mile southward from this station, on the banks of the Saskatchewan, lignite coal 
is mined in rocks of the Belly River subdivision of the Cretaceous. There are two seams,&quot;of which 
the lower (about five feet thick) is worked. Fine exposures of rocks all along this part of the river. 

242. Langevin. In boring for water at this station, a copious flow of combustible gas has been 
tapped. 

243. Cassels. Here also combustible gas in large quantities flowsj from well. The Pierre shales 
must overlap the Belly River series near here, but the surface shows drift deposits only. On the river, 
a few miles to the south, the base of the Pierre is marked by a fine seam of coal 4&apos; 6&quot; thick. 

244. Bassano. Good sections showing base of Laramie and top of Pierre, four miles southwest on 
Bow River, where a coal-seam 4&apos; 4&quot; thick occurs. 

245. Crowfoot. Lignite coal 9&apos; thick exposed on Bow River to south, and underlying Crowfoot 
at depth of about 100&apos;. Shaft sunk to coal north of track, 135 feet deep. 

246. Calgary. Excellent exposures of Laramie rocks along Bow River to south of line from Bas- 
sano to this point. The plain, as seen from the railway, a gently undulating drift-covered surface, 
showing no exposures of the underlying rocks. At bridge across the Elbow River, at Calgary, massive 
Laramie sandstones. Calgary is the farthest western point on this parallel to which Laurentian frag- 
ments from the northeastward have been traced. The boulders and gravel farther west appear to be 
entirely derived from the Rocky Mountains or of local origin. 

247. Radner. For about twenty-eight miles west of Calgary the railway, following the Bow River, 
passes over Laramie rocks, nearly horizontal, but forming the northern extension of a wide synclinal 
occupied farther south by the Porcupine Hills. Between Cochrane and Radner the belt of disturbed 
and flexed rocks which he along the base of the mountains, constituting the foot-hill country, is en- 
tered. Numerous fine sections of Cretaceous and Laramie in river-banks to Kananaskis. 

248. Kananaskis. The Cretaceous or Laramie sandstones are here nearly flat, but appear to dip

below the Palaeozoic limestones of the mountains, which are seen in cutting just beyond this station. 
Above cutting, well-marked glaciation due to former Bow Valley glacier. (The railway here enters 
the Rocky Mountains.) Below mouth of Kananaskis River, fine falls over Cretaceous sandstone on 
Bow River. The great limestone series of the mountains, characterized above as Devono-Carbonifer- 
ous, is the most important constituent of the range in this part of its length. No separation, except 
quite locally, has yet been found possible between the Devonian and Carboniferous parts of the series. 

249. The Gap. The valley beyond this point becomes quite wide, and turns to the northwest, fol- 
lowing a belt of Cretaceous rocks. 

250. Canmore. The valley here floored by the Cretaceous rocks above referred to. while lime- 
stones form the mountains on both sides. The Cretaceous is in the form of a long synclinal trough, 
compressed and overturned to the northeastward. Looking southeastward from this point down 
the valley, a section of the overturned rocks is seen in the distant hills. 

251. Between Dnthil and Banff, near the railway and to the north about two &apos;miles from Banff, 
openings have been made on anthracite coal-seams in the metamorphosed Cretaceous. Seams three to 
five feet. Coal of excellent quality. 

252. Silver City. Castle Mountain, a remarkably bold range of Devono-Carboniferons limestone, 
nearly horizontal, rises immediately behind this place. Numerous discoveries of copper-ore in the 
vicinity. 

253. Eldon. A few miles beyond Silver City the valley again turns to the northwest, following 
axis of anticlinal, which brings up Cambrian slates and quartzites. Mountains on both sides of valley 
fltill continue for the most part limestone. 

254. Laggan. Remarkably picturesque lake, with glacier at head a few miles to the south. 

255. Stephen. Near summit, between headwaters of Saskatchewan and Columbia Rivers, the gen- 
eral structure of the watershed range is synclinal, but complicated by minor flexures. Cambrian rocks 
appear a few miles down valleys both east and west of the summit. Grand peaks to north and south 
of valley of pass, in several cages exceeding 11,000 feet altitude. This is the only railway in North 
America from which actual glaciers of almost Alpine magnitude may be seen. Observe snow-field 
and glacier in first valley from north, west of Stephen. 

250. Stonewall. Excellent exposures, in quarries, of Silurian limestones, in some beds highly f os- 
fiiliferous. 

257. Stone Fort. Quarries near Stone Fort and St. Andrew?. Fossils.

259 Parkbeg. The so-called Continental moraine is represented in Dakota and the North- West 
Territory of Canada by the Missouri Cdteau. It would appear that this and the so-called Cdteau des 
Prairies in Minnesota and Dakota are parts of the same great feature. Their elevation is similar, and 
they are equally characterized by the immense profusion of erratics with which they are strewn, and 
by basin-like swamps and lakes. In southwestern Minnesota and eastern Dakota this elevated tract, 
according to Winchell, called by the earliest French explorers Cdteau des Prairies, meaning highlands 
feet above the Minnesota River, and 1,300 to 2,000 feet above tlu 



of the prairies, is 500 to 1,000 __ __ , , 

In the COteau, then, viewed as a whole, we have a natural feature of the first magnitude, a mass of 
glacial debris and traveled blocks, with an average breadth of perhaps thirty or forty miles, and ex- 
tending diagonally across the central region of the continent, from the southeastern corner of Minne- 
sota far into northern Canada, a distance of about 800 miles. Dr. George M. Dawson, from whose 
writings this note is compiled, was the first to recognize the glacial origin of the Missouri C6teau. He 
pronounces it one of the most remarkable features of the Western plains in their northwestern exten- 
sion, and as certainly the most important monument of the glacial period existing there. As to its 
origin, while he believes that the Cdteau may possibly represent a Continental moraine, his examina- 
tion of it led him to consider it as more probably due to a deposit of material from floating ice 
along the sloping front of the third prairie steppe. It is a question which should not be prejudged, as 
so many difficulties remain to be elucidated, from whatever stand-point it may be regarded. As to the 
similar deposit farther south in Minnesota and Dakota, etc., T. C. Chamberlin and other geologists, 
who have critically studied it, are quite decided in their belief that it is a terminal moraine. The 
superficial deposits are to be, for geologists, the great subject of the future. J. M.

* Keduced levels above ordinary high water of Pacific Ocean. 

301. The rocks forming the south side of Burrard Inlet, and underlying the flat or gently undu- 
lating tract about the mouth of the Fraser, are, so far as known, Tertiary, and, at least in part, of Mio 
cene age. The covering of drift being, however, thick, and the region as yet but partially explored, it ii 
difficult precisely to fix the limits of these rocks. Cretaceous rocks of the Shasta group, and possiblj 
of the overlying series to which the coals of Vancouver Island belong, also occur. 

302. The Cretaceous rocks above referred to are supposed to cross the Fraser about here. The} 
are somewhat extensively developed on Harrison Lake, and hold abundance of Aucella Piochii, whicl 
may be considered as the most characteristic fossil of the Cretaceous of the mainland of British Co 
kimbia. 

303. The metamorphic rocks of the Coast Ranges, named the &quot; Cascade Crystalline series &quot; in th&lt;preliminary classification, consist of a great variety of gneissic and schistose materials. Orthoclas* 
felspars are seldom developed, and dioritic rocks are abundant. The series also includes limestones 
It is, with little doubt, of the same age with the similar rocks of the vicinity of Victoria, and thes&lt;are known to be Palaeozoic, and probably, in part at least, Carboniferous. The series has been largely 
built up of contemporaneous volcanic rocks which have since been extremely metamorphosed. Larg&lt;granitic and syenitic intrusive masses are frequent. 

304. At Silver Peak, near Hope, at a height of about seven thousand feet, exceptionally rich silver 
ores occur. These exist in veins traversing a small outlier of the Shasta Cretaceous which occupiei 
the summit of the mountain. Litigation has so far prevented the development of these mines. 

305. At this point the line enters the Canon of the Fraser, and the scenery becomes grand in th&lt;extreme, the river breaking through the axial portion of the Coast Range. From the mouth of the An 
derson River (Boston Bar) the valley becomes again comparatively wide, and the mountains retreat t( 
a greater distance. 

306. The immediate valley of the river is excavated, in this part of its C9urse, in dark slaty o; 
schistose rocks, which have been referred to as the &quot; Anderson River series &quot; in preliminary reports 
The age of these is uncertain, but they are very possibly Triassic. They underlie the lowest Greta 
ceous, and rest between it and the older crystalline rocks, and have evidently been the source of th&lt;gold which is found on this part of the Fraser. The bar. and bench diggings of the Fraser were at oni 
time very remunerative, and were the first in British Columbia to attract attention and lead to an in 
flux of miners. Subsequently the mines of the Cariboo country and rich gold finds in other districts 
drew away the mining population. 

307. A trough of Shasta Cretaceous here crosses the river obliquely. It forms the hills and mount 
ains which rise above the valley on the east, for many miles to the southward. The rocks consist o 
hard, greenish sandstones or quartzites, with beds of conglomerate, and evidently represent, for th&lt;most part, the deposit of a shore-line. At Jackass Mountain, on the wagon-road, they are well shown 
and have yielded specimens of Aucella Piochii and other fossils. 

308. The line here leaves the Fraser to follow the Thompson River. Immediately north of Lyt 
ton the Cretaceous trough above referred to which appears in the intervening distance to be inter 
rupted resumes, and characterizes the Fraser Valley for a long way to the north. 

309. The Tertiary rocks of this part of the province are all provisionally classified as Miocene, an&lt;are probably of the age of the &quot; Truckee Miocene &quot; of the 40th Parallel Report. They consist genet 
ally of sandstones, shales, etc., capped by a great thickness of volcanic materials which are largely 
basaltic. The sedimentary part of the formation frequently holds lignites or coals, and a number o: 
fossil plants have been obtained from it. 

310. The rocks provisionally classed as Carboniferous are, at least in great part, of that age, an&lt;hold limestones characterized by Fusulina. They consist, however, for the most part, of quartzitei 
and hard shales, and contain great beds of contemporaneous volcanic matter, in association witl 
which nerpentines occur. These rocks are well displayed on the wagon-road from Ashcrpft north 
ward to Clinton. The serpentines, with associated conglomerates, etc., are best seen on this road be 
Uveen Hat Creek and Mundorf &apos;s. 

311. The rocks in this vicinity are much altered, but those in the valley appear to belong to an iso 
iated Cretaceous area. 

312. General Note on Unfinished Portions of Line east of Kamloops Lake. The line may no\ 
(December, 1884) be said to be practically completed to Kamloops Lake, leaving, under construction, i 
length of about one hundred and eighty miles eastward from this point to the mouth of the Kickini 
Horse River, on the Columbia. The lower end of Kamloops Lake lies on rocks of the Cache Creel

eerier, which have been characterized in a previous note ; the greater part of the lake is, however, bor- 
dered by volcanic rocks of Tertiary age. Cherry and Battle Bluffs, on opposite sides of the lakes, are 
believed to represent the core of an ancient Tertiary volcano. In the former considerable veins of mag- 
netite occur. Remunerative gold placers have been worked for many years on the Tranquille River, 
which flows into the lake. Near the town of Kamloops the rocks of the C&amp;che Creek series reappear 
and characterize the banks of the South Thompson River to the lower end of Little ShuswapLake, though 
the higher portion of the plateau to the south is composed of volcanic Tertiary rocks. White silty de- 
posits, due to the last stage of the glacial period, are cut into terraces along the banks of the river. 
Little and Great Shuswap Lakes, with Adam&apos;s Lake, are fjord-like bodies of water occupying deep, 
mountain-bordered valleys in the western portion of the Gold Range. The lakes are bordered by 
gneissic rocks and crystalline schists, which have been referred to collectively, in the reports of the 
Geological Survey, as the Shutwap series, and are now believed to be Archaean. These rocks prob- 
ably exceed thirty-two thousand feet in thickness, and are divisible into several subordinate series. 
For further information on the country from the mouth of the Fraser to this point, see &quot; Descriptive 
Sketch of Physical Geography, and Geology of Canada, 1884,&quot; and &quot; Report of Progress, 1877-1878.&quot; 
LeavingShuswap Lake, the line follows nip the valley of Eagle Creek and traverses the Gold Range 
by the Eagle Pass to the west crossing of the Columbia River. Thence it crosses the Selkirk range To 
the east crossing of the Columbia, and follows that river up (southward) to the mouth of the Kicking 
Horse. This portion of British Columbia may be said to be geologically unknown, but C9nsists, so 
far as ascertained, of rocks similar to those of the Shuswap Lakes, with quartzites and schists which 
are probably Cambrian.

V. . 

I. Montreal to Quebec. Little of geological interest is to be seen on this route, the river- 
banks being generally low, or where higher usually showing only drift deposits. Near Quebec, sec- 
tions of Cambrian and Cambro-Silurian rocks. 

Quebec and Gulf Ports. Quebec to Pictou, Nova Scotia, with calls at intermediate ports. 
A picturesque and geologically interesting route. 

Quebec. (See Note 24, under Intercolonial Railway.) Soon after leaving Quebec, a fine distant 
view of the Montmorenci Falls. Beyond the east end of the Island of Orleans, Laurentian rocks form 
the north shore. At St. Paul&apos;s Bay, Little Mai Bay, and Murray Bay, small outliers of Cambro-Silu- 
rian. Beyond these the north shore is entirely Laurentian. Behind Murray Bay the nwuntains are par- 
ticularly bold. The south shore to beyond St. Anne des Monts is composed of Cambrian rocks, which 
form picturesque hills near Bic. 

Father Point. Pilot station. Cambrian. 

Metis. Cambrian. A sea-side resort. 

Beyond Matanne the Shickshock Mountains to the south. The higher portions composed of Pre- 
Cambnan rocks with extensive granitic intrusions. Beyond St. Anne des Monts the south shore is 
fringed with Cambro-Silurian rocks to Gaspe Bay. 

Gasp6. Ship Head, at northern entrance to Gasp6 Bay, a bold promontory. Lower Helderberg 
limestone. The shores of Gasp&lt;Bay are generally characterized by Devonian rocks. Excellent sec- 
tions. Fossil plants. The south point of Gaspe&quot; Bay is C9mposed of rocks of the Bonaventure (Lower 
Carboniferous) series. This occupies the coast to the Baie des Chaleurs. 

Perce Silurian limestones here appear below the Bonaventure, and form the remarkable pierced 
rock, two hundred and ninety feet high, which gives the place its name. 

Baie des Chaleurs. (See notes under Intercolonial Railway.) The northern shore of the eastern 
part is principally composed of Silurian and Bpnaventure rocks ; the southern, at Bathurst, Bonaven- 
ture formation eastward, to Point Miscou, Middle Carboniferous. 

Miramichi Bay. Shores all Middle Carboniferous. Carboniferous rocks constitute the whole New 
Brunswick shore to Pictou. Prince Edward Island, Permo-Carboniferous and Triassic. 

Quebec to Sagnenay River. 

Quebec. (See notes under Intercolonial Railway and Quebec and Gulf Port steamers.) 

Murray Bay. An outlier of Cambro-Silurian rocks here occupies the coast for a distance of six 
miles, and runs up the Murray River for a similar distance, gradually narrowing out. The rocks are 
well displayed in White Point at the wharf and at Les Ecorches on the east side of the bay. They 
consist of limestones and calcareous sandstones, Black River, and Trenton, and are highly fossilifer- 
ous in some places. Fossiliferous glacial clays on some parts of the beach at low tide. Ancient sea- 
margin terraces with marine shells to height of over 600 feet in this vicinity. 

Rivie&apos;re du Loup. Cambrian. Marine shells in glacial clays of beach on east side of bay at mouth 
of river. 

Tadousac. At mouth of Saguenay River. Laurentian. Fine examples of terraces at several 
levels. The Saguenay River, from this point to Ha Ha Bay, is the finest example of a fjord on the 
eastern coast of North America, and is celebrated for its grand and gloomy scenery. It possesses all 
the characters of a true fjord bold rocky shores without beaches, uniformity in width, great depth in 
its upper part, and comparatively shallow water at its mouth. From Tadousac to Ha Ha Bay is a dis- 
tance of about sixty miles. Near this point the valley bifurcates, one branch reaching to Lake St. 
John forty miles by Chicoutimi, while the other is occupied in part by Lake Kenogami. The 
rocks to Ha Ha Bay and Chicoutimi are all Laurentian, and generally heavily glaciated. Near the 
wharf at Ha Ha Bay an intrusive mass characterized by anorthosite felspar. Round Lake St. John 
extensive area of Norian rocks, with overlying Cambro-Silurian, and glacial clays with marine shells. 
The existence of this great fjord is probably due to the greater drainage area tributary to it as com- 
pared with other rivers on the north shore, and it was probably in the first instance excavated by the 
river at a period of greater continental elevation than the present. 

Port Mulgrave to Sydney, C. B. (Steamers connecting with Eastern Extension Railway 
at Port Mulgrave and running through the Bras d&apos;Or Lakes to Sydney, C. B.) 

Port Mulgrave. (See Notes 65 and 66, under Eastern Extension Railway.) 

The Bras d&apos;Or Lakes are celebrated for their picturesque scenery. They are almost altogether sur- 
rounded by a fringe, of varying width, of Lower Carboniferous rocks, behind which rise hills of Pre- 
Cambrian rocks. The formations met with in Cape Breton generally are, however, very varied. 

Sydney. Coal-formation rocks, with the most important coal deposits of Cape Breton. The prin- 
cipal workings are in the Sydney main seam, averaging about six feet thick, and these already extend ! 
in some places to a considerable distance beneath the sea. Fine section on northwest side of Sydney 
Harbor, described by Mr. Brown as including thirty -four seams of coal and forty-one underclays with 
Stiymaria. Erect trees and Calamites at eighteen distinct levels. Sydney mines afford good coal for 
gas-making and steam purposes, yielding a ftrong coke. 

II. Toronto or Kingston to Montreal by Steamer. This is a favorite route with tourists. 
After leaving Toronto, the north shore of Lake Ontario iu composed of Hudson River rocks for twenty&gt;: 
miles. Thence Utica twenty miles, Trenton one hundred miles. The rocks are generally heavily cov- 
ered with drift, which often forms steep banks. Both shores, and the islands at the eastern extremity; 
of the lake, are based on Black River limestones. The north shore is then occupied by Laurentian for 
about thirty miles, the river cutting through a narrow neck of these rocks, which connects the great 
Laurentian area to the north with that occurring in New York State. This produces the well-known 
scenery of the Thousand Islands. For ten miles above Brockville the rocks on the north shore, Pots- 
dam ; south shore, Laurentian and Potsdam. Thence Calciferous on both shores twenty-five miles.&gt;Thence to Mill Roches (twenty-seven miles), north shore, Chazy ; south shore, Calciferous. Thence 
Calciferous on both shores, twenty -four miles. Thence to Coteau (fifteen miles), north shore, Chazy ; 
south shore, Calciferons. Thence, for eight miles, both shores and Grand Island, Calciferous. Thence, 
in twenty-six miles, Potsdam, Calciferous, Black River, Trenton, Utica, in regular succession to Mon- 
treal. (See notes on Grand Trunk Railway, which runs parallel to north shore of lake and river.) 



STEAMBOAT ROUTES. 83 



THE RAPIDS OF THK ST. LAWRENCE. Throughout that portion of the river characterized by 
rapids, the rocks are those of the Canibro-Silurian system. The Lachine Rapids occur over the oat- 
crop of the Trenton limestone, the wide basin occupied by the river below being excavated in the 
softer Utica shales. With this exception, no very marked connection between the geological structure 
and the existence of the rapids is evident. The rapids may be said to begin below Prescott, but are 
unimportant till the Upper Long Sault is reached, thirty miles below that place. Four and a half 
miles below these are the Longue Sault Rapids, which are twelve miles in length, with a fall of forty- 
eight feet. Farther down, at C6teau, the rapids recommence, and are kno\yn as the C6teau Rapids. 
Below these is calm water for about five miles, when the Cedar Rapids, a mile and a half long, occur. 
After three miles of calm water are the Cascade Rapids, below which Lake St. Louis, at the mouth of the 
Ottawa River, is entered. The Lachine Rapids, between this lake and Montreal, are the last, with a 
descent of forty-five feet. Above the Lachine Rapids the descent of the river is one hundred and 
seventy-five feet, making the total descent, from Lake Ontario to the head of ocean navigation in 
the harbor of Montreal, two hundred and twenty feet. The average fall of the river is about eighteen 
inches to the mile, but a large part of this descent is accomplished in the various rapids. These are 
surmounted by vessels ascending the river by a series of canals, aggregating forty-two miles in length. 

III. Routes from Sarnia, Owen Sound, Collingwood, etc., to Port Arthur (con- 
necting there with C. P. Railway). 

Two main routes are followed one to the south of Manitqulin Islands to&apos;Sault St. Marie, the other 
to the north of the islands to the same point. The boats leaving the last-mentioned ports frequently 
take the north shore route, which, from a geological or picturesque point of view, is to be preferred. 

The south shore of the Manitoulin Islands is throughout composed of Niagara limestones, with 
outlying patches of Guelph in some places. 

After clearing Notawasaga Bay, the northeast shore of Georgian Bay is Laurentian to and at Kil- 
larney. Thence the shore of the mainland is for seventy-five miles Huronian, the off -lying islands con- 
sisting of Cambro-Silurian rocks, from the Black River series to the Niagara. The north shore is then 
for twenty miles Laurentian, this formation forming a narrow band with Huronian behind. Then 
twenty miles Huronian to Bruce Mines. 

Bruce Mines. Good locality for studying the Huronian rocks. Copper-mines at one time exten- 
sively worked ; at present closed. The veins traverse a mass of interstratified diorite. The ore is 
chiefly copper pyrites. From Bruce Mines for ten miles, north shore, Huronian ; south shore, Cam- 
bro-Silurian. Thence to Lake Superior, both Sugar Island and the southwest main shore of peculiar 
red and spotted sandstone of Potsdam or Chazy age. Thence to Port Arthur steamers generally run 
far from land. The north shore is principally Laurentian and Huronian to Nipigon Bay, whence 
Lower Cambrian rocks characterize the shore and form all the off -lying islands to Thunder Bay. 

Thunder Bay. (See Note 224, under C. P. Railway.) 

IT. Victoria to Nanaimo and Comox and Northward. 

Victoria. Highly altered rocks dioritic. felspathic, and micaceous, in a few places becoming al- 
most gneissic, with interbedded black argillites and crystalline limestones. The latter in a few places 
hold obscure fossils, which are Palaeozoic and very probably Carboniferous. Many intrusive syenitic, 
etc., masses ; one of which characterizes both sides of Victoria Harbor at the entrance. The rocks of 
this vicinity may be taken as typical of those forming the axial portions of Vancouver Island, and are 
largely altered volcanic products. Limestone may be observed near entrance to Beacon Hill Park, and 
at tne shore at the west end of the town. Fossils in limestone on road near east side of Esquimalt Bay. 
Very fine glaciated rocks everywhere along the shore. These are overlain by boulder-clay, and this 
again by stratified clays and sands which in some places yield marine shells. Good sections of all 
these deposits in shore cliffs. (See papers in &quot; Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc.,&quot; Vol. XXXIV., p. 89, and ibid., 
1881.) 

From Victoria, northward along coast, similar rocks to Saanich Point, the end of which is fringed 
by Cretaceous. 

Cowichan Harbor. South side, Cretaceous. North side, metamorphic rocks (Carboniferous ?). 

Maple Bay. South side, Cretaceous ; north side and at wharf, similar metamorphic rocks. From 
Maple Bay, for eight miles, coast metamorphic, off-lying islands Cretaceous. Thence to Dodd Nar- 
rows, coast and island Cretaceous. (Productive coal measures.) Just north of Dodd Narrows, high 
cliffs of these rocks. 

Nanaimo and Departure Bay. Productive coal measures (Cretaceous). Extensive coal-mines. 
Seams worked five to fifteen feet. These are true bituminous coals, yielding a good coke, and suitable 
for gas manufacture. From Departure Bay, for fourteen miles, the coast chiefly of metamorphic rocks 
like those above described. Thence to Comox, forty-two miles, Cretaceous. 

Comox. An extensive coal-field, but by reason of the more accessible position of Nanaimo the 
mines here are not at present worked. On Texada Island, to the northeast, fine deposit of magnetic 
iron -ore. 

N. B. The route above described is that taken by coasting steamers. Steamers bound north- 
ward to Port Simpson and Alaska generally pass farther out near the off-lying islands. These are 
almost altogether composed of Cretaceous rocks, and, in consequence of their general northeastward 
dip. the outer tier of islands displays the higher members of the formation as nere developed. The 
southwestern sides of the islands generally form low sanflstone cliffs. 

Route Northward from abreast Comox to Port Simpson and Alaska. From Comox 
the Cretaceous rocks probably extend in a wide belt along the shore nearly to Seymour Narrows, but 
are heavily covered by drift deposits, which form white cliffs. High mountains in the interior of Van- 
couver Island composed, so far as known, of crystalline rocks, witn extensive granite intrusions. 

Seymour Narrows and northward to Alert Bay. Metamorphic and crystalline rocks. (See Note 
803, Can. Pacific Railway, W. Coast portion.) Near Port McNeil, Cretaceous rocks again form a strip 
of low country, extending back from the shore, and continue to Beaver Harbor. Thomas Point and 
north shore of Beaver Harbor, and thence to north end of Vancouver Island, all rocks of the older 
cries. Similar metamorphic and crystalline rocks, with interbedded slaty argillites and limestones, and 
granitic intrusions northward to W rangel, in Alaska. In vicinity of Port Simpson, slaty argillites and 
mica schists with limestones extensively developed. Near Wrangel similar mica schists yield very 
fine garnet crystals. Wrangel is at the mouth of the Stickeen River, by which the gold-mines of Cas- 
siar are reached.

GENERAL NOTE ON THE GEOLOGY OP NEW ENGLAND. 

THE geology of the New England States is much more difficult than that of the country west of 
the Hudson River and Lake Champlain. The rocks are very largely crystalline, besides being greatly 
contorted and folded. Both Archaean and metamorphic Paleozoic groups are represented, and geolo- 



are to be found. Different views are also entertained as to the value of lithological distinctions for 
chronological purposes. Fortunately, a few fossiliferous areas have escaped the ravages of upheaval 
and denudation, and it is only by a study of the relations of these to the underlying or overlying crys- 
tallines, that any attempt at correlation is possible. The principal localities where fossils are found 
are (1) the region of the Taconic schists and Stockbridge limestones : (2) that of probably Devonian 
limestone in the Connecticut Valley at Bernardston : and Niagara limestones at Littleton, N. H. ; 
and (3) that of carboniferous rocks in Rhode Island and their continuation northeastward into Massa- 
chusetts. Devonian fossils have been found in the northern part of Maine, and Silurian and Devo- 
nian in the eastern part of Maine. The 16. Triassic of Connecticut Valley need not be named as one 
of these doubtful areas. 

The scheme of classification proposed by Professor C. H. Hitchcock for the whole of New Eng- 
land is printed on an introductory page, while his determinations as to the formation at each railroad 
station are those given in this &quot; Guide &quot; for Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut. In 
the chapter on Massachusetts, the determinations for each railway station are given by Professor W. 
O. Crosby, representing a class of geologists holding widely different views, who recognize the Taconic 
system and believe that the white crystalline marble, 3,000 feet thick, in Berkshire County, Mass., lies 
below the Cambrian, and is a distinct and much older formation ; and claim that the fossils referred 
to occur in outliers of the newer, resting on these older formations, just as they often do elsewhere. 
They also claim that the highly crystalline Taconic schists can not be correlated successfully with the 
Cambrian or with the Hudson River group. 

The following scheme of classification of the New England crystallines, by Professor Hitchcock, 
IB also very different from that given by Professor W. O. Crosby for Massachusetts. The differences 
are occasioned chiefly by the views entertained concerning the igneous rocks, syenites, granite, and 
porphyry. In Dr. Hitchcock&apos;s scheme these are regarded as of later origin than the gneisses, which 
have been disturbed by their eruption ; but Professor Crosby seems to regard many of the syenites, 
felsites, and diorites as older than the gneisses ; because the latter appear to rest or lean upon the un- 
stratifled rocks. The difference is so radical that the schemes can not be harmonized. But, in a work 
of this character, it is right that the different views should be represented. 

Professor Hitchcock also thinks that the word Montalban Is misleading, and, as restricted by him 
in New Hampshire, it would not embrace over one sixth part of the rocks so named by Professor 
Crosby. The typical area of Montalban in the White Mountains is said by the former to be either 
overlaid or cut by the rock called Norian by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt and Professor Crosby. Hence, it is 
claimed, the Norian is the newer of the two, and the scheme proposed for Massachusetts is by him 
considered erroneous. 

However the reader may differ with either party, he will find much positive knowledge which all 
will accept in these pages, where the kinds of rock along the railroads are given, i. e., gneiss, mica 
chiets, granite, etc., and we can leave it to time to give to these formations of doubtful age their true 
place in the series, for it is believed that the discovery of fossils here and there about New England 
may, after a while, settle the geology of a large portion of that difficult country, and that even an 
accepted classification of the crystalline rocks may be accomplished. J. M.

1. The eruptive rocks of Maine have not been studied yet. The &quot; traps &quot; along the sea shore are 
Of at least four different ages. The oldest is porphyritic ; the second metalliferous ; the third waa 
ejected earlier than the Devonian ; while the fourth has cut Hamilton sandstones. In the northern 
part of the State is a trappean conglomerate, with pebbles more than a yard in diameter. A light- 
colored, coarse diorite forms a mountain mass in Rangely, and the same material is commingled 
with serpentine farther north, nearer the Canada line. The granites and syenites are as varied as those 
of New Hampshire. The granite of Biddeford is the same as the Conway granite of New Hampshire, 
but with fewer cavities to produce disintegration. A drab-colored porphyry occurs in mountain 
masses upon Moosehead Lake and near Mount Katahdin. Siliceous slates and jaspers abound on 
the coast of Washington County. 

The Lower Helderberg is also cut by trap dikes in several localities.

2. Livermore. Station at gorge in Pemigewasset River, and shows finely several dikes of igneous 
rocks of different ages. As carefully studied by Dr. Hawes, they are diabase, olivine diabase, cuorite, 
syenite, and granite. 

3. Thomaston. The location of the limestone-quarries furnishing the famous Rockland or Maine 
lime. 

4. Oldtown. Most of the ancient valleys of New England have an escar or ridge of coarse gravel 
and sand following the channel of the current as the ice of the glacier period began to melt. These 
ridges are more common in Maine than elsewhere. 

5. Vanceboro. The pale argillites along the St. Croix River, near and below Vanceboro, are 
called Devonian by Messrs. Bailey and Matthew, provincial geologists of New Brunswick, because of 
the discovery of the remains of Lepidodendron in it in the Magaguadavic Valley. 

6. Eastport. These same authors regard the red sandstones near Eastport as of Lower Carbon- 
iferous age, instead of the Hamilton Devonian, as they have been heretofore referred. St. Andrews, 
N. B., or Calais, Me., is the nearest railroad station to Eastport.

7. The New Hampshire formations are believed to possess thickness as follows : Niagara, 500 
t feet ; Calciferons mica schists, 4,800 feet ; CoOs group, 7,300 feet ; Cambrian slates of Connecticut 
1 Valley, 3,000 feet ; Kearsarge group, 1,300 feet ; Rockingham mica schists, 6.000 feet ; Merrimack 

group, 4,300 feet ; Huronian, 12,000 feet ; Montalban, 10,000 feet ; Lake Winnipiseogee gneiss, 18,000 
feet ; Bethlehem gneiss, 5,000 feet ; porphyritic gneiss, 5,000 feet. 

8. Paris. Locality of the famous red and green tourmalines. At least one hundred remarkably 
toe specimens of tourmaline have been taken from this vein and placed in museums or cut as gems. 
forty varieties of minerals occur in a coarse granite, one of which is mica in large plates. 

9. North Conway. Mount Kiarsarge, in full view from the station, is a conical mass of Albany 
;ranite which has broken through both the Conway granite and a slate, and contains numerous frag- 
nents of both these rocks in its igneous embrace. 

10. Crawford House. The railroad passes from here through the well-known notch of the White 
Mountains and around the base of Mount Willard, a region as famous for its varieties of granite as for 
(cenery. The cut at the summit is through typical Montalban schists. Opposite Dismal Pool it is 
reversed by an enormous vein of fine-grained granite, which has also cemented together immense 
ragments of the Montalban schists. The junction between this Franconia breccia and the succeeding&gt;onway granite, may be followed up a cliff for one thousand feet higher than the railroad, the latter rock 
laving been erupted last. Between this Conway granite and a dark slate often filled with large pencils 
rf andalusite is the interesting vein, three hundred feet wide, of Albany granite, which illustrates the 
iction of a melted rock upon slates, giving rise to &quot; contact phenomena. The slates have been ren- 
lered more crystalline ; have been altered into hornstone ; the broken pieces have been cemented by a 
iiliceou. paste full of microscopic tourmalines; and Carlsbad twin crystals of orthoclase, with dihex- 
igonal pyramids of quartz, are developed in the lower part of the Albany granite. All these and other 

interesting phenomena may be seen along the railroad in a walk of half a mile. 

11. Twin Mountain. The large boulders of granite east of the hotel are part of the moraine of a 
ocal glacier which has moved in a aorthwest direction. The boulders have certainly been transported 
nom some ledge nearer Mount Washington than Fabyans&apos;s. &apos;

12. Potter Place. Mount Kearsarge may be reached from this station, or from Warner upon the 
Concord and Claremont Railroad. The rock is an andalusite mica schist, the same with that or Moun 
Monadnock in Jaffrey and the base of Mt. Kiarsarge near North Conway. (Please notice the spelling 
of Ki and .ZTearsarge.) 

13. Grafton. Locality of the largest beryl known, weighing two and one half tons. This wafc 
formerly preserved beneath a rude shed built to protect the mineral, but the shed and crystal havt 
now fallen into decay. Very large crystals of the same mineral are now found occasionally in one 
of the mica-quarries. 

14. Weir&apos;s. About half a mile from the station is a thick bed of clay lying between the lower anc 
upper till. 

15. Ashland. Between Weir&apos;s and Ashland many excellent exposures of porphyritic or oldes 
gneiss may be seen along the railroad. Over twenty of these areas have been described in the State 
and are supposed to represent the earliest known ejections of igneous matter, in which foliation han 
been superinduced in concentric layers resembling strata. 

16. Littleton. The f ossilif erous limestone, here first called Lower Helderberg, is regarded by Pro 
f essor R. P. Whitfield as Niagara, because of the presence of the chain coral and of Pentamerus ny&lt;, 
tins. 

17. Hooksett. The railroad-bridge over the Merrimack River rests upon islands of a white quart2, 
which are the outcrops of a remarkable vein, traced for over 125 miles, from Royalston, Mass* 
to Bridgeton in Maine. A second vein, parallel to this, crosses the river just north of Manchester, tot 
miles distant. 

18. Manchester. The prevailing rock is a coarse saccharoidal gneiss, believed to correspond ven 
closely in lithological cspcct with the typical Lanrentian of New York and Canada. 

19. Concord. The traveler will do well to visit the State-House, with its large relief map of tb! 
State, and the large cmarries of Concord granite two miles toward West Concord.

23. LIST OF ERUPTIVE ROCKS OP VERMONT. Diabase, diorite, trachytic porphyry, muscovite 
granite, mica hornblende granite, protogene, granitell, concretionary granite, granite of veins, sye- 
nite, brecciated syenite. The trachytic porphyry is supposed to have been erupted at the close of the 
Silurian. 

24. Bellows Falls. The finest exhibition of terraces along the Connecticut River north of Mas- 
sachusetts is just south of the village of Bellows Falls. 

25. Windsor. An interesting escar has been traced from Lyme, N. H., to Windsor, Vt., about 
thirty miles long. Portions of it have been removed by the wearing action of the Connecticut. It 
appears to have been deposited by a powerful current derived from the melting of the glacial sheet 
prior to the accumulation of terraces. Mt. Ascutney, 3,186 feet high, is proved to be an eruptive mass 
of syenite and granite which has been protruded through a narrow orifice and poured out over a floor 
of the calcif erous mica schist about one thousand feet above the sea, very much as lava accumulates 
around a volcanic vent. The melted material penetrated cracks in the underlying calciferous mica 
schist, forming veins indurating the clayey layers, calcining and glazing the limestones, but where it 
flowed over gneiss the floor remained unaffected. Many other granite mountains in Northern New 
England show similar proofs of protrusion at the surface. 

26. The center of the anticlinal axis of the Green Mountains. At least eight of the general sec- 
tions of the Vermont survey show this feature of structure, proving this formation to be older than 
the Huronian adjacent upon both sides. This structure was denied oy Logan for the continuation of 
the Vermont rocks in Canada in his generalizations, but his descriptions of the rocks confirm the views 
of the Vermont geologist. Dr. Selwyn, the successor of Logan m office, accepts the Vermont view. 

27. Ludlow. In Plymouth, ten miles north, gold is now (1885) being profitably milled from quartz. 
It is in the Huronian, which may be followed continuously to Zoar and Chester, Mass., upon the Fitch- 
burg Railroad. 

28. Rutland. The Rutland Railroad follows the Champlain Valley, noted for the presence of the 
entire series of Lower Silurian groups. The valley itself is a part of the great Appalachian Valley, 
extending from the St. Lawrence to Alabama, and constituting a natural and well-marked boundary 
between the crystalline groups on the east, known as the Green Mountains, Highlands of New York 
and New Jersey Blue Ridge of Virginia, and the true Appalachian Mountains on the west from the 
Catskills to the Cumberland plateau, in Tennessee. 

29. Charlotte. Champlain clays. The bones of a Beluga, a species of white whale, were found 
near here while excavating a railroad cut in 1849. one hundred and fifty feet above the ocean. The 
subdivision proposed by C. B. Adams in 1846 was that of the lower &quot; Blue clay,&quot; containing a deep-sea 
fauna, and an upper &quot; Brown clay,&quot; carrying littoral species. Several years later, Dawson proposed the 
names of &quot; Leda clay &quot; and &quot; Saxicava sand&quot; for the synchronous deposits in the St. Lawrence Valley. 

30. Georgia. This town has furnished thirty or forty species of trilobites and other fossils of the 
Middle Cambrian, or a horizon between the Potsdam sandstone of New York and the St. Johns or 
Acadian group of New Brunswick and Eastern Massachusetts.

31. Arlington. A few miles east, in the edge of Sunderland, is the best-known exposure of the 
junction of the Potsdam qnartzite with the unconformably underlying gneiss of the Green Mount- 
ains. The blue quartz of the granite veins crossing the gneiss is recognized as the source of the grains 
of sand in the quartzite. Also an excellent locality for the Scolithus. 

32. St. Johnsbnry. Eastern Vermont is largely underlaid by a mica schist having a micaceous lime- 
stone interstratified with it, to which the name of &quot; calciferons mica schist &quot; is applied in the State re- 
ports. It is called &quot; Silurian &quot; when it passes into Canada, and &quot; Montalban mica schist &quot; in Massa- 
chusetts. Protracted studies show the strata to be disposed in a synclinal attitude, overlyingclay slate. 
Numerous areas of granite have been erupted through it, both in Vermont and Canada. There is an 
excellent development of this rock at St. Johnsbury Center and at Danville. 

33. Fairlee. A few miles west of this station is the famous Ely copper-mine, for many years the 
greatest producer of the metal from the yellow sulphuret of any mine in the United States. Six 
miles west of Pompanooeuc are other copper-mines, and an establishment producing copperas. 

34. Norwich and Hanover. A few rods east of the station, on the east side of the Connecti- 
cnt, the escar has been cut through by erosion, showing an anticlinal ridge of gravel underlying the 
ten-arc-; of Hanover Plain. The same ridge has been cut by White River at White River Junction, 
where the same structure is observable. 

35. Hanover. The collections of the Geological Survey of the State are placed in the Museum of 
the State Agricultural College. A marked feature is the arrangement of over three thousand litho- 
logical specimens in geographical order, taken alon^ thirteen parallel sectional lines across New 
Hampshire and Vermont. Colored geological profiles accompany the specimens, with the locations 
and dips indicated, so that one can discover the mutual relations of the rocks without the labor of 
traveling over the country. In the same room is a large relief map of the same States, colored geo- 
logically, upon the horizontal scale of one mile to the inch.

36. Hardwick. A few miles north, in Craf tesbury, is the celebrated concretionary granite, in 
which concentric balls of mica are numerously interspersed, to which the local name of &quot; petrified 
butternuts &quot; has been applied. 

37. NOTE. The very minute description of the foliated crystalline rocks of Connecticut by J. Q. 
Percival furnishes the basis for the following attempted correlation of them with similar groups else- 
where. The Trias divides the crystalline into an eastern and western &quot; Primary &quot;and Roman letters 
were used by Percival for the subdivisions of the western primary group. A. is undoubtedly the Hu- 
ronian of the upper Connecticut. B. is the range of clay slate to the west, the same with that in Ber- 
nardston. near Guilford, Vt, and the Ammonoosuc gold-field, N. H. C. is the calciferous mica schist. 
D. is probably Middle Laurentian. E., F., G., H., and I. belong to the Green Mountain gneiss, per- 
haps partly Montalban. K. is Lower or typical Laurentian. L., M., N., O., and P. are the Cambro- 
Sifurian lime-stones and schists called Taconic by Emmons. The A. and B. of the eastern Primary 
comprise both Lower and Middle Laurentian. C. is probably Montalban. D. and E. are the south- 
ward extension of the ancient Laurentian gneiss of Worcester County, and P. is closely allied to the 
Montalban. 

Percival did not determine the nature of the &quot; traps &quot; of Connecticut, but showed their arrange- 
ment in curves ; Professor Dana determined the constituent minerals to be pyroxene and labradonte 
with magnetite. Dr. G. W. Hawes confirmed this determination, but uses the name diabase instead 
of dolerite ; Percival found, in both the eastern and western primary, systems of dikes parallel to 
the borders of the Trias entirely through the State; these are anhydrous, while those in the sandstones 
are mostly hydrous and amygdaloidal.

1. The central portion of Boston, embracing the termini of all the railroads entering the city, rests 
n an unbroken drift formation ; but numerous excavations and borings have shown that the nnder- 
fing rock (a the Acadian or Braintree slate. Artesian wells on Causeway and Providence Streets have 
enetrated the slate to depths of 1.700 and 2,500 feet. 

2. The hills in Chelsea and vicinity are fine examples of lenticular drift hills or drumlins. 

8. The adjacent rocky peninsula of Nahant consists chiefly of coarse diabase, which intersects 
LCadian slate and limestone at East Point. 

4. This is an interesting locality. South of the station is the Parker River basin, which is a closed 
ynclinal of Acadian slate and conglomerate, resting on banded petrosilex. and including con-tempora- 
leons beds of melaphyre. Within half a mile of the station, toward the northwest, are the Devil&apos;s Den 
nd Devil&apos;s Basin, abandoned quarries of limestone and serpentine, which have afforded specimens of

5. The rocky peninsula of Marblehead Neck, lying opposite the town, across the harbor, is com- 
posed chiefly of granite (2 a) and many varieties of petrosilex and felsite (2 b). On the shore north OF 
the town are fine exposures of the Norian syenite (1), both stratified and eruptive. 

6. The celebrated siuging beach is not far from the station. 

7. The most important of the Cape Ann granite-quarries are in the town of Rockport.

granite (3 a). There are important quarries in the granite, and the quartzite pebbles in the conglom- \ 
erate contain Primordial forms of Lingula. 

12. The most extensive coal-mines in New England are at the Coal Mine Station in Portsmouth, i 

13. The shore east and south of the city gives a very good section of the Carboniferous strata. 
The chasm called Purgatory is on the shore two miles from Newport. Newport Neck is chiefly com- j 
posed of granite and metamorphic slates. 

14. The important granite-quarries of Quincy are chiefly in the immediate vicinity of this village. &apos; 

15. Outcrops are almost unknown between Scituate and Plymouth, but the drift probably rests at 
most points on Huronian granite (2 a). 

16. The drift of this region is thick and unbroken, and there is much doubt concerning the bound- &apos; 



aries of the underlying 
17. South and east 



formations. 



, of Middleboro the rocks are very rarely exposed, and Barnstable County, in 

which the greater part of this division lies, does not include a single outcrop. The cliffs near High-j 
land Light, in Truro, on the extremity of Cape Cod, afford fine sections of the drift deposits, and aiso* 
include fragments of calcareous sandstone, filled with characteristic Eocene fossils, indicating the. 
occurrence of Eocene strata under this part of Massachusetts Bay.

18. The Worcester slates include a bed of anthracite one mile east of the city. It was mined fifty 
years ago. and granite is now quarried in that vicinity, on Millstone Hill. 

19. The emery-mine, one half mile from the station, is an important mineral locality. One mile 
west of the station the railroad crosses an immense bed of serpentine (3 f). 

20. The Taconian limonite deposits are extensively mined in Richmond, and the celebrated boulder 
trains are in the western part of the town.

25. The falls of the Deerfield River are near the station, and are interesting on account of the 
numerous large pot-holes exposed, and the contortions and metamorphism of the gneiss, which here 
marks an important anticlinal axis. One mile west of the station ancient pot-holes are exposed inl 
the railroad cut, fifty feet above the present bed of the river. 

26. The rocks traversed by the tunnel are well shown in the vast deposit of dtbris between the 
station and the eastern portal. The side of the mountain above the portal is serpentine, the same belw 
that crosses the Boston and Albany Railroad near Chester. One half mile east of the station is a 
quarry in soapstone and chlorite schist, affording green foliated talc. 

Travelers on the Boston and Albany, and Fitchburg Railroads, have a good opportunity to observe^ 
the stratigraphy of the mountainous district between the Berkshire and Connecticut Valleys. 

The main Hoosac range is probably an overturned or broken anticlinal, the exposed beds nearly&lt;all dipping to the east. A synclinal axis is reached at Chester, on the Boston and Albany line, anas 
near Zoar, on the Fitchburg. 

Beyond this the strata dip to the west until we reach the anticlinal axis at Shelburne Falls, on the; 
Fitchburg, beyond which they dip to the east again for about eight miles, or until covered by the Tri- 
assic beds. 

The second anticlinal is not exposed on the Boston and Albany road, passing under the Triassic ; 
before it reaches that line. 

27. The noted locality of fossil footmarks is on the west bank of the river, one and a half miles &apos; 
above the village. W. W. Draper was the first person to observe them, in 1835. He suggested thafl 
they were &quot; turkey tracks made two thousand years ago.&quot; His impressions were communicated toil 
Colonel Wilson, who called the attention of Dexter Marsh to them. Mr. Marsh collected many find 
slabs, and showed them to Dr. James Dean, who requested Professor E. Hitchcock to investigate theinfl 
scientifically. This was done, and the results accumulated in the Hitchcock Ichnological Museum at 
Amherst, where are over twenty thousand separate ichnites, illustrating about one hundred and eixtjg 
species, all from the Connecticut Valley. 

28. This is the locality furnishing for the Amherst Museum the large rows of tracks of Srontozoum^ 
Giganteum, the largest of the Triassic birds. Across the river, in South Hadley, is an excellent locaM 
ity of Otozoum Moodii, so named for Pliny Moody, who was the first person in the Connecticut Valley! 
known to have observed any of the footmarks. A specimen is preserved which he dug up in ISOOjja 
saying that &quot; the tracks were made by Noah&apos;s raven.&quot; 

29. This is the town where the celebrated Helderberg limestone crops out. It is believed to be a 
remnant of a once extensive deposit, preserved accidentally from erosion, and resting upon or folded] 
beneath the Coos quartzite.

30. The Taconic limestone is here a beautiful white marble, and it is extensively quarried. Less- 
important quarries, worked for lime or marble, occur the entire length of the Berkshire Valley. 

31. Amesbury. This and the adjoining towns, also the immediate city of Boston, are chiefly oc- 
cupied by a profusion of lenticular-shaped drift hills, believed to be moraines of ancient glaciers, and 
different from the usual ground moraine of glacial drift. The hills may be two hundred feet high, 
and their longer axes run southeasterly, being parallel with the course of the striae in the neighbor- 
hood. They consist of till, and resemble the drnmlins of Scotland. They also occur conspicuously 
in southern New Hampshire, and other parts of New England, and in western New York. In the Mer- 
rimack and Connecticut Valleys a few have been found having a direction to the south and west of 
eouth. but agreeing with the course of adjoining striae. 

32. Plymouth. This township is said to contain three hundred and fifty-six ponds. These lie in 
hollows of the drift. 

33. Wood&apos;s Holl. The extreme terminal moraine of the ice-sheet, which constitutes the &quot;back- 
bone &quot; of Long Island, also Block Island, and the hilly part of Martha&apos;s Vineyard, from Gay Head to 
Vineyard Haven. It also appears at Chappaquiddick and Tuckernuck Islands, and forms Saul&apos;s Hills 
and Sankaty Head on Nantucket. A second terminal moraine, five to fifteen miles north from the 
foregoing, extends on the north shore of Long Island, from Port Jefferson to Orient Point, forms Plum 
and Fisher&apos;s Islands, reaches along the south shore of Rhode Island, from Watch Hill nearly to Point 
Judith, forms the chain of Elizabeth Islands, and continues on the peninsula of Cape Cod, from Wood&apos;s 
Holl to North Sandwich, and thence east to Orleans. 

The portions of Martha&apos;s Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod, south of these moraines, and also 
Eastham. Wellfleet, and Traro, are modified drift. 

Manomet Hill, east of Plymouth, is a moraine connected with that of Cape Cod and the Elizabeth 
Islands. 

34. The numbers attached to the Norian, Huronian, Montalban, and Taconian, and their subdivi-

GENERAL NOTE. The State of New York is to the geologist what the Holy Land is to the Chris- 
tian, and the works of her Palaeontologist are the Old Testament Scriptures of the science. It is a 
Laurentian, Cambrian, Silurian and Devonian State, containing all the groups and all the forma- 
tions of these long ages, beautifully developed in belts running nearly across the State in an east 
and west direction, lying undisturbed as originally laid down. Railroads running north and south 
pass over a number of the formations in short distances, while those running east and west run for 
long distances on the same formation, as for example the N. Y. C. A H. R. R. R. on the 6. Salina, and 
the Erie Railway on the 11 b. Chemung. In the eastern part of the State the formations are more 
irregularly disposed. New York localities are those to which we must always go back as the stand- 
ard by which any disputed formation of these ages is to be tested. 

1. The author has bestowed more of his own labor and research on the local geology of this 
State, than any other, having besides diligent study of all the official reports, made personal observa- 
tions of the exposures of the formations in traveling for many years on all the railroads. It was from 
making geological notes on the margin of railroad timetables that he conceived the idea of this 
ecological railway guide book for the State, and by calling in the aid of scientific gentlemen of other 
States, he has been enabled to extend it over the whole United States and Canada. To Prof. James 
Hall, of Albany, the State Geologist, he is indebted for much information as to some of the localities 
in this State. [Note to first edition.] In revising this chapter the editor has made changes in the 
first edition only where recent investigations have rendered them necessary. In the revision he 
has been advised by the gentlemen whose names appear as authority for new lines and new notes 
and especially by Prof. W. B. Dwight of Vassar College. When no authority is given for any portion 
of the chapter, it will be understood that it has been taken from the first edition. J. R. M. 

2. The table here given is not satisfactory to all of the contributors to this chapter, but, where 
terms are used by them in a different sense, the change is indicated by the number or otherwise. 
The Cambrian, as given in the table, is also divided into Lower (2 a), Middle (2 a.) and Upper (2 b.). 
In the first edition &quot;Cambrian&quot; included 2 b. 4 c.and was divided into Lower (2 b.), Middle (3 a., 3 b. 
(Quebec), and 3 c. (Chazy) ), and Upper (4 a., 4 b., and 4 c.) J. R. M. 

3. N. Y. C. ft H. R.&apos;R. R. GRADES CACSID BY GEOLOGICAL STBUCTUB*. This railroad undoubtedly 
Jccupies the finest locality for an east and west railroad in the United States. It owes this to sreologi- 
ji structure, the outcrop of the formations running east and west, and the Salina or Onondaga, 
Utica and Hudson River soft shales are cut into low valleys through which the railroad and Erie 
Cana! are built. If the formations had run north and south, as they do in Pennsylvania, Maryland, etc.,

and been turned up edgewise, the hard sandstones would have been high ridges and perhaps moun- 
tains to overcome-as they are everywhere from the Mohawk Valley to Alabama. If even the lime- 
stone ridge of the Helderberg range, which bounds this valley on the south, had taken a northern 
direction, as the 2-4. formations do, a tunnel would probably have been necessary. In 
the western part of the State these Helderberg limestones continue, but not as a prominent ridge. 
The road via Geneva, runs on them at Auburn, Clifton Springs, etc., but with less favorable grades 
than the direct road, and at Buffalo they are level with the plain. It should be added that the old 
Laurentian mountains at Little Falls and at Peekskill have been cloven from top to bottom, thus 
opening the gateways for the traffic and travel of the West. The popular impression that New York 
is a level plain like the prairies of the West, derived from traveling on the N. Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R., 
is altogether erroneous. There is only a narrow trough through the centre of the State, in which 
tiie railroad and canal are located, that is of this level character. 

4. New York island is 12 miles long and nearly two miles wide. The widest point is two and 
one-quarter miles at 14th St. Below &apos;Grand street it gradually becomes narrower as well as at the 
north end. The lower part of the city, below Wall street, is half a mile wide. The rock of the 
island is gneiss, except a portion of the north end, which is limestone. The south portion is covered 
with deep alluvial deposits, which in some places are more than 100 feet in depth. The natural out- 
croping of the gneiss appeared on the surface about 16th street, on the east side of the city, and ran 
diagonally across to 31st street on 10th Avenue. North of this much of the surface was naked rock. 
It contains a large portion of mica, a small proportion of quartz and still less feldspar, but generally 
an abundance of iron pyrites in very minute crystals, which, on exposure, are decomposed. la 
consequence of these ingredients it soon disintegrates on exposure, rendering it unfit for the pur- 
poses of building. The erection of a great city, for which this island furnisnes a noble site, has 
very greatly changed its natural condition. J. M. 

Dr. Hunt claims that the New York gneiss is in great part of Montalban age (1 d.) and the same 
with that of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, and that it rests upon the Laurentian gneiss 
of the Highlands, which he says is the surface rock in the northern part of the island, but Dr. J. D. 
Dana thinks it extremely probable that the limestone and conformably associated rocks of Westches- 
ter County and New York Island, as well as those of the Green Mountain region from Vermont to 
New York Island, are metamorphosed Lower Silurian (including Cambrian) strata. J. R. M. 

5. Ontheopposite side of the river may here be seen for many miles the Palisades, a long, rough&apos; 
mountain ridge close to the water&apos;s edge. Its upper half is a perpendicular precipice of bare rock of 
columnar structure from 100 to 200 feet in height, the whole height of the mountain being generally 
from 400 to 600 feet, and the highest point in the range opposite Sing Sing 1,011 feet above the Hud- 
son, known as the High Torn. The width of the mountain is from a half mile to a mile and a half, the 
western slope being quite gentle. In length it extends from Bergen Point below Jersey City to Hav- 
erstraw, and then westward in all 48 miles, the southern portion being merely a low ridge. The 
lower half of the ridge on the river side, is a sloping mound of detritus, of loose stones which has 
accumulated at the base of the cliff, being derived from its weathered and wasted surface. This&quot; 
talus and the summit of the mountain are covered with frees, with the bare rocky precipice called 
the Palisades between. Viewed from the railroad or from a steamboat on the river, this lofty mural 
precipice with its huge weathered masses of upright columns of bare rock, presenting a long, 
straight, unbroken ridge overlooking the beautiful Hudson River, is certainly extremely pictur- 
esque. Thousands of travelers gaze at it daily without knowing what it is. J. M. 

&apos; treat sheet of basalt 



the trap has come from below as a dike through a longrent|or fissure and then extended eastward 
by intrusion between the layers of sedimentary rock. Subsequent erosion has removed the overly- 
ing strata near the crest line and for some distance back but at many points along the western 
side of the ridge, the dike structure and relations to the overlying strata are finely exposed. 
See Notes 145 and 134. N. H. DARTON. 

(See description of the 16. Triassic formation and its Trap Dikes.) Here is a remarkable but not&apos; 
uncommon instance of a great geological blank. On the east side of this river the formations be- 
long either to the Archaean and oldest rocks, or to the Cambro-Lower Silurian, metamorphosed, 
while on the west side they are No. 16. all the intermediate Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous 
formations being wanting. This state of things continues all along the Atlantic coast to Georgia, 
the 18. Cretaceous or 17. Jurassic taking the place of the 16. Triassic farther south. J. M. 

6. 38 Montrose to 54 Cornwall. This celebrated passage of the Hudson through the Highlands, 
is a gorge nearly 20 miles long from 3 miles south of Peekskill to Fishkill, and is worn out of the 1 a. 
Laurentian rocks far below mean tide water. The hills on its sides rise in some instances as 
much as 2,600 feet, and in many places the walls are very precipitous. The rock is gneiss, of a kind 
that Li not easily disintegrated or eroded, nor is there any evidence of any convulsive movement.

t is clearly a case of erosion, but not by the present river, which has but very slight fall in cross- 
ng them to join tide water near Peekskill. This therefore was probably a work mainly per- 
ormed in some past period when the continent was at a higher level. Most likely it is a valley of 
jreat antiquity. Also see note 17. 

7. From Dutchess Junction to Troy, revised bv Prof. W. B. Dwight, from Rhinebeck to 
?roy the stratigraphy being given on the authority of Mr. S. W. Ford, except that his nomenclature 
Las been modified so as to harmonize with that adopted in this chapter. 

8. Schodack. A series of great dislocations with upthrows on the east side traverse eastern North 
jnerica from Canada to Alabama. One of these great faults has been traced from near the mouth of 
he St. Lawrence River, keeping mostly under the water up to Quebec just north of the fortress, 
hence by a gently curving line to Lake Champlain or through Western Vermont across Washing- 
on and Rensselaer Counties into Columbia County. The line of faulting has been recently traced 

louthward to Schodack. Landing and to the south of Poughkeepsie and is supposed to run in to tnoth- 
r series of faults, probably of a later date, which extend as far as Alabama. It brings up the *ocks&gt;f the 2 b. Potsdam group in Vermont and New York on the east side of the fracture to the level of 
the4c. Hudson River and 4 a. Trenton 1. s. on the west. In some places the Trenton appears 
n the east. J. M. 

This fault is met with, a little more than half a mile east of Troy along the line of Jacob street. The 
ocks upon its eastern side (Potsdam) there hold an interesting fauna. From that point the fault 
ikes a somewhat irregular course, being nearly two miles inland from the Hudson at GreenbusL 
od comes out upon the Hudson about a mile and a half south of Schodack landing. S. W. F. 

9. CatskiU Mountains. For many miles on this railroad are beautiful views of the Catskill 
fountains, 3,000 feet high, (12. Catskill,) several miles distant on the opposite or west side of the river 

uid which furnish the name for the Catskill formation. The wide valley between them and the 
iver is composed of 11 b. Chemung, 10. Hamilton, 7 Lower Helderberg and 4 c. Hudson River. The 
jeology on the east or railroad side is entirely different. 

10. Albany. The clay beds at Albany are more than 100 feet thick, and between that city and 
chenectady they are underlaid by a bed of sand that is in some places more than 50 feet th&apos;ck.

has ever been found beneath them. The scenery has suddenly changed, and nothing is seen but 
bare, weatherworn precipices of crystalline rocks, from which all the elements through all the ages, 
have failed to produce a soil, yet a certain strange interest is attached to them. The oldest picture ; 
in the world, the oldest statue or other work of art, would excite the greatest attention, yet what are 
these in antiquity compared with these grand old Laurentian rocks, the oldest formation and the 
oldest dry land on the face of the earth, dating far back of the first appearance of either animal or veg- 
etable life of any kind on our planet. The river channel through these rocks is an unequivocal exam- 
ple of river erosion, as pot-holes are found at various heights. See also notes 6 and 56. 

18. Utica. The 4 b. Utica slate was named from this city. To study the Trenton, Black River 
and Birdseye limestones at their original, historical localities, change cars at Utica and go up the 
Utica and Back River Railroad to Trenton Falls. (See the within guide for that railroad). You can 
then go on to Watertown on these limestones. Return by the Rome, Watertown&amp;Ogdensburg Rail- 
road to Rome or Syracuse, examining the Loraine shales at Adams and Pulaski. 

19. From here to Syracuse there is no lock in the canal. This long level is 427 feet above tide. 

20. Oriskany. The formation of this name, is not exposed here, but at Oriskany Falls on the D. L.i&amp;W. R. R. from which the name is derived. The best fossils of it are found east of Union Springs in 
Cayuga County. Along the part of the road east of Oriskany, the Utica shale forms the bottom of 
the valley. The south wall of the valley consists of the outcrops of the 4 c. Hudson River, 5 a. Onei- 
da Conglomerate, 5 b. Clinton, the 6 Waterlime and 9. Upper Helderberg. See 191. 

21. Rome. No more 2-4 formations west of this in New York. From Rome to Buffalo and; 
from Lake Ontario south to the Pennsylvania line all the formations are 5-11 Silurian and Devonian, 
and they are finely displayed in numerous gorges, ravines, canons and precipices, very regularly 
disposed in belts of outcrop running east and west. The typical localities from which most of the 
formations were named, are situated in this district. It is all historical geological ground, and you 
can scarcely go amiss in looking for fossils, 

22. West of Little Falls the lower formations pass abruptly to the north and cross under Lake 
Ontario into Canada. The 4 c. Hudson River first crosses the valley, and then the Oneida conglom- 
erate. Other rock formations now appear between Rome and Oneida, which had no existence in the 
basin east of LittleFalls. These are the 5 a. Medina and Clinton, which overlie the Oneida, and form 
all the south shore of Lake Ontario, and extend across Canada West. Also 5 c. Niagara and the 6. 
Salina or Onondaga salt group, on which the N. Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R. runs from Oneida nearly to Roches- 
ter. The non-existence of these extensive formations east of Little Falls (the 5 a. Medina, 5 b. Clin- 
ton, 5 c. Niagara and 6. Salina), which cover the best part of Western New York, must be owine; to 
the two parts of the State being separated in these early ages by the old Laurentine ridge at Lit- 
tle Falls into separate basins, in which the rock-forming conditions were different. 

23. Verona. The Clinton fossil iron ore crops out on the railroad, but not of a good quality. 

24. Oneida. The prominent ridge bounding the valley on the south of Utica, Oneida and Syra- \ 
cuse, called Stockbridge Hill, Pompey Hill, Cazenovia Hill and Onondaga Hill, is the Helderberg 
range, a continuous mountain 800 feet high, forming the back-bone of the State, and composed at its 
base of the 6 Waterlime, of the Salina group, all the members of the 7. Lower Helderberg being want- 
ing as well as the 8. Oriskany sandstone and other sandstones that separate the Lower and Upper 
Helderberg, except a mere trace. On the Waterlime rests the Onondaga limestone, the most valu- 
able building stone, and above this the Corniferous. Over these three great limestone formations is 
always found the 10 a. Marcellus shales, the 10 b. Hamilton and the 10 c. Genesee, forming the fine 
fertile country extending south from this ridge. Still farther south is the 11 a. Portage with its 
glens, gorges and precipices, and lib. Chemung, extending to the Pennsylvania State line. The 
Oneida conglomerate, which is 30 or more feet thick in Herkimer and Oneida, gradually attenuates 
ingoing west, being ta grey band, from 4 to 6 ft. thick at Rochester. It was named from Oneida 
County. 

25. Wampsville. Numerous fragments of Niagara limestones are seen mixed with the soil, 
showing its existence underneath. The Niagara limestone and shales which, at Niagara, Lockport 
and Rochester are 150 ft. thick, thin out in going eastward, being only two or three ft. thick at Sa- 
quoit Creek near Utica. 

26. Canastoto. Stop off and take the branch railroad to Cazenovia, rising 750 feet in 15 miles. 
Fine geological sections of 6. Salina with gypsum beds, 9 Upper Helderberg and 10 b. Hamilton. Mag- 
nificent view across Oneida Lake and a beautiful village and lake at Cazenovia. 

, 27. Syracuse. Onondaga Lake, which is in sight and on the north side of the railroad at the west 
end of Syracuse City, is 5 miles long , 1 mile wide; its greatest depth is 60 feet, and its surface is 363 
feet above tide water. It is excavated in the red shale of the (6.)Salina formation. The lake is what 
remains of an ancient much more extensive and deeper excavation, all of which has been filled in 
with sand, gravel and rolled stones, except the part occupied by the lake. The bottom and sides of 
the lake are covered with lake marl six feet thick. The ancient excavation underneath answers an 



ter material for the purpose. Into this basin the various borings of the salt wells are made, not through

or into rock, but only through the lake marl and other loose material mentioned, to a depth of 150 to 450 
feet. No rock salt or bed of salt has ever been discovered in this State, although it has been in Canada; 
but in this Salina formation are twoporous or Vermicular masses of limestone, looking as if perforated 
by little worms, and hence the name ; and between them are certain hopper shaped cavities in the 
shale in which, as well as in the perforations of these limestones, salt in a crytallme and solid state, 
it has been conjectured, formerly existed, the saline materials of which have been dissolved in 
water which percolated through the formation and passed into the basin where it is now found, the 
bed of marl on which is Onondaga Lake, being afterwards formed over it. But the origin of the 
salt water may be said to be at present unknown. Forty gallons of the brine produce a bushel of 
salt, weighing 60 pounds. These are the most productive salt wells in the world in so small a terri- 
tory two miles long and one-fourth of a mile wide. 

28. Marcellus, from which the formation is named, is three miles south of this station. 

29. Skaneateles. From the Junction with the N. Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R. the Skaneateles railroad runs 
south up the outlet of the lake of that name over the Corniferous limestone. The lake outlet 
with its falls, amounting to 463 feet to Jordan, affording excellent mill sites and many exposures 
of the rock. Before reaching Skaneateles Village the railroad passes over the Marcellus shales. 
Skaneateles Lake, where the railroad terminates, is 14 miles long, from a half to a mile and a half 
wide ; its greatest depth south of Borodino is 320 feet and its surface 879 feet above tide. The sides 
of the northern end of this lake, at the beautiful village of Skaneateles, gradually slope to the water, 
corresponding in inclination to each other and adding greatly to the beauty of the lake. The water 
line, with the exception of the south part, is excavated in the Hamilton group. The south part of the 
lake is more narrow, and the banks rise abruptly to a considerable height above the water. The 
Tully limestone, at the top of the Hamilton, and over that of the Genesee slate, appear to the pouth 
of Borodino, rising, when first seen, 150 feet above the lake, and the south end or head of the lake 
is surrounded by the Portage group. Fossils along the lake. Cyathophylloid corals. 

30. Auburn. The Corniferous member of the 9. Upper Helderberg limestone and the Onondaga 
limestone, which is its lower member, are extensively quarried at Auburn. The State Prison and 
the facings of many of the buildings of this handsome little city are entirely made of this limestone, 
and several fine churches are built of it. The formation ends at the main street where the 10 a. 
Marcellus shale begins, and it extends in the stream up to the outlet of the lake. Beginning below 
the city and following up the stream to the State Prison, the outlet exposes the following section: 
eight feet of the upper part of 6. the Waterlime of the Salina formation, one foot of 8. Oriskany sand- 
stone, over eight feet of 9 c. Onondaga limestone and twenty -seven feet of the Corniferous exclusive 
of its upper member the Seneca limestone. 

31. Geneva. The Seneca limestone of the upper part of the 9. Upper Helderberg disappears near 
Waterloo and reappears at a distance of six or seven miles west near Oaks Corners. The whole 
ma&gt;s of limestone, and all the rocks north of it to Lake Ontario, have been removed from all the 
intermediate space, and along the shore of that lake the great depth of alluvium conceals the rock 
if any be present. Near Oaks Corners the limestone suddenly terminates as if broken off and 
removed, leaving an abrupt descent to the east which bears evidence of the erosive action of water. 
Seneca Lake and Lake Ontario probably originally communicated by this deep old channel. Ontario 
is 196 feet lower than Seneca. The same state of things seems to exist north of Cayuga Lake, where 
the drift material causes the Montezuma marshes and the shallowness of that lake at that end. Sen- 
eca Lake is 40 miles long, 3 miles wide, 530 feet deep, and its surface is 441 feet above tide water. 

32. Jordan. Between Skaneateles Junction and Elbridge the Oriskany sandstone is over 30 feet 
thick, being at its maximum. At Auburn it is from six inches to two and a half feet thick. 

33. Weedtport. At many points between Syracuse and Rochester, and on the Southern Central 
and other cross roads, are seen numerous hills or short ridges running from north to south, from 
fifty to one hundred feet high, with steep slopes and very sharp crests. These are not of drift or 
alluvium, as they appear to be, but are in reality outliers of the marly deposits of the Salina or On- 
ondaga salt group, with only a thin covering of loose materials. Mount Hope at Rochester, the hills 
south of Brighton, Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, James street hill and University hill in Syracuse, 
and numerous hog-back ridges about Jordan and other places, are of this character, being Salina 
shales in place, spared when the adjoining valleys were eroded. There are, however, some hills 
composed of gravel, or a mixture of gravel and sand, but very little glacial drift on this R. R. 

34. Great crops of peppermint are raised here, and this place supplies the world with pepper- 
mint oil. There seems to be some peculiarity in the soil which adapts it for the production of 
this plant

35. Irondequoit. A few miles east of the mouth of the Genesee River, the Irondequoit Creek i 
empties into the lake, &apos;flowing in a deeper channel than the Genesee, but through deposits of sand 
and gravel. Professor Hall suggests with much probability that the Genesee ran in the channel of 
the Irondequoit, but when that was filled with gravel and the region elevated, the Genesee was . 
turned westward and compelled to cut its present rocky bed like the Niagara. This phenomenon 
is not rare, but is many times repeated in this State. See notes 31, 38, 39 and 110. 

36. Rochester. See Genesee Falls out of the car windows on the north side at the east end ofl 
the station house. The gulf of the Genesee River, from Rochester to Charlotte, is remarkable for 
the striking example of erosion which it exhibits. The distance is seven miles, in which the river 
forms three cataracts over three distinct formations, the Medina sandstone the lowest, 84 feet fall ; 
the Clinton 25 feet one and three-fourth miles below, and the Niagara group 96 feet fall, close to the 
railroad bridge. It is evidently the different hardness of the groups or their varying facility of de- 
composition that have produced these falls. These three falls at first were but one, and at this time the 
lower ones are gaining probably on the upper one and the time may come when they will unite again. 

37. The 5 a. Medina formation is named after this place. Layers filled with Lingula and Leperdilia. 

38. At Lockport is a repetition of the Rochester and Niagara Falls ravine in the Niagara lime- ; 
utone and shales here crossed by the railroad on a high bridge. Here too, a mile west of the city, 
you can see on the north side of the railroad an old, dry channel from which the stream was diver- 
ted by the drift, corresponding to the Irondequoit at Rochester and St. David&apos;s at Niagara Falls. 
There is another of these dry, old channels at Oak Orchard. Niagara fossils found here. 

39. Niagara Falls are six and a half miles south from Lake Ontario at Lewiston, and the whole 
distance the river runs in a gulf, which, at the falls, is 160 feet, and at Lewiston, 300 feet deep and 
generally about twice as wide at the top as at the bottom. The rocks passed through by the receding 
falls are the Medina sandstone, the Clinton group of limestone and shale, and the Niagara limestone 
and shale. These rocks have a slight southerly dip, and all except the Niagara group have disap- 
peared beneath the bed of the river, the falls being now in the Niagara group entirely, the shale 
lying beneath the limestone. At the whirlpool, a little more than three miles below the falls, on the 
west bank of the river, the continuity of the rock forming the bank is interrupted by a deep ravine 
filled with drift material. This ravine many be traced two miles in a northwest direction, and from 
thence another depression can be followed to Lake Ontario at St. David&apos;s four miles west of Queens- 
town. When the ravine to St. David&apos;s was blocked up by drift materials the stream would be forced

to find its present rocky channel. Even though the drift rose only a foot higher than the rocks it 
would as effectually force the water over the rocks as if it formed a mountain. Could the river have 
once surmounted the drift, its work would have been comparatively easy in wearing out a bed 
through the old ravine, but till it was able to flow over the barrier it would have no power over it, 
and must commence its slow work of wearing away the solid rock. The present gulf shows us 
what it has done since the drift period. J. HALL and SIB CHARLES LTELL. 

40. At Black Rock there is only from 6 to 14 inches of the Onondaga limestone which is of a 
grayish color, crystalline and contains few fossils. The Corniferous limestone above it is 25 to 30 feet 
containing abundance of hornstone. It is dark colored, fine grained, and in its fresh fracture, and 
particularly when wet, it presents an almost black appearance, which has given the name of Black 
Rock to the place. It affords good quarries of excellent building stone. From the occurrence of 
the Corniferous along the south ena of Lake Erie and its dip southward, it seems probable that the 
bed of this lake has never been excavated below it, and that it now&apos;forms the floor beneath the de- 
posit of alluvium. It seems that there are others of the lake bottoms composed of limestone, espec- 
ially Lake Ontario. See note 71. This is probably for the reason &apos;that it received a polish from the 
action of glaciers which then passed over it, while the resistance of the grit of the sandstones and 
shales was more favorable for deeper excavation. Lake Erie is 230 miles long, 50 miles wide, 140 feet 
deep and its surface is 569 feet above tide. 

41. Batavia is the highest point on the N. Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R., and one of the highest in Western 
New York, being 895 feet above tide. This is caused by there crossing the 9 c. Helderberg forma- 
tion, which maintains its elevation although not observable as a mountain range, being overcome by 
easy grades. Notice the elevations of the railroad crossings of the Helderberg and Hamilton range, 
although the railroad seeks the lowest points ; Buffalo, 584; Batavia, 895; Le Roy, 872; Canandaigua, 
74&quot;: Auburn, 715; Skaneateles, 890; Tul|y, 1249; Cazenovia, 1249; Cooperstown, 1193. When the valleys 
cut through the limestone, the summit is farther south on the Hamilton or Portage. 

42. Lewiston. Tourists should not fail to go down to Lewiston, the terminus of the Buffalo and 
Niagara Falls division. This railroad ride, although little known, is one of the finest in the United 

It follows the bank of the Niagara River, affording admirable views of the rapids and the 
formations displayed in the gulf. Nowhere in the State are there better geological sections. On the 
Canada side, also the Canada Southern Railway, running to the mouth of the Niagara River at Niag- 
ara City, affords one good view of the falls, but no such remarkable sections of the rocks as on the 
American side, where the railroad overhangs the fearful torrent of the river for several miles. 

43. Knowersville. The Helderberg mountain shows finely on the left or southwest side of the 
railroad opposite Guilderland and Knowersville. The railroad passes through it between that place 
and Duanesbnigh. The mountain is capped by the 7. Lower Helderberg limestone forming a steep 
precipice along its summit, and this rests on the 4 c. Hudson River slates. Back of Knowersville 

rehes are cut out of the mountain by two streams, leaving a picturesque, for tress-like bluff of 
the limestone. The Helderberg formations are named from this mountain. See Note 158. 

44. At Howe&apos;s Cave large quarries on the railroad track. Good place to examine Lower Helder- 
berg limestone and to collect fossils. The cave is an old underground water channel, and it is several 
mile- long. Notice that the limestone at Cobleskill is Upper Helderberg and that at Howe&apos;s Cave 
Lower Helderberg. On no other railroad can you see them both. 

45. Cooperstowu is seated at the south end of Otsego Lake on a dike of alluvium. This lake 
is a handsome sheet of water seven miles long, one and a half wide, 1193 feet above the ocean. 
I r has a high ridge of the Hamilton group on the east side, a low and interrupted range of the same 
on the west .side, and an elevated projection on the northeast end. This lake is one of the head 
waters of the Susquehanna, the valley spreading out to the southwest. See also 186. 

46. Sharon Springs. All the large sulphur springs of the State, Avon, Clifton, Richfield, etc., 
and manv small ones, rise from the waterlime. Glacial Striae here and at Cherry Valley. 

47. Cherry Valley. The railroad is on Corniferous, but the cliffs and gorge are Walerlime, Lower 
Helderberg, Cauda Galli,and, slightly, Oriskany. Marcettus and Hamilton form the hills on the south.

48. On either side of the valley, according to Prof. Hall, is the following section: Pyritiferousjj 
shales, (Clinton group); Coralline limestone, (Niagara); Waterlime, (Salina); Tentaculite; Pentamerus; 
Delthyris shaly limestone ; Upper Pentamerns. (Lower Helderberg); Oriskany; Cauda Galli ;Soho-

49. The Schoharie grit formation was named from this place. The fossils peculiar to it are 
found in the mountain one and a half miles northwest and northeast of Schoharie. See note 159.

51. White Hall is usually called the head of Lake Champlain, but the lake for 15 miles is rarely .1 
more than 100 to 150 yards wide. It is in fact a mere channel between mud flats and clayey alluvium. 
Lake Champlain is 112 miles long, 600 feet deep, and the surface being only 96 feet above tide, it

extends 500 feet below the level of the ocean. Its bed is a deep chasm in the Laurentian or Primitive 
rocks. On the west side, where the mountain ranges reach it, the slope is abrupt, but on the east 
side it is longer and more gradual. At many places the lake is bordered by steep banks of blue and 
yellowish brown clay and yellowish brown sand, rarely over 15 feet thick, but its greatest height is 
100 feet at Burlington. It contains marine fossils in the mixture of clay and sand, but none in the 
clay beneath. This drift formation extends north to the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. In Al- 
bany County it is an immense mass and is known as the Albany clay. 

52. From Dresden to Port Kent, 67 miles the Laurentian hills are the western boundary of the 
valley of Lake Champlain. But at many points this mountain ridge recedes from the lake, &quot;leaving 
nooks and valleys, in which are patches of 3 b. Chazy and 4 a. Trenton limestone along the railroad. 

53. The magnetic iron ore mines back of Port Henry are worth a visit, the bed of the ore being 
more than 100 feet thick. The mining of these heavy beds is on a grand scale. 

54. From 51 Westport to 77 Port Kent, the formation, according to Dr. Hunt, is 1 c. Norian or 
Upper Laurentian. 

55. At the village of Essex, on the lake and between Whallonsburgh and Willsborough stations, 
is a bold bluff, 100 to 200 feet high above the lake, of 3 b. Chazy limestone. 

66. The Adirondack Mountains commence at Little Falls, rising suddenly from the Mohawk 
Valley, and run northeast to Port Kent on Lake Champlain. The most elevated peak, Mount Marcy, 
JM67 feet high, the summit being just upon the region of perpetual frost. There are four other 
peak&gt;- 5,000 feet high, each distant aoout 6 miles from the other. This group of Adirondack Moun- 
tains is the culminating point of the State around the sources of the Hudson, Ausable, Racket and 
Black Rivers, and dividing the north half of the State into two separate geological basins. They 
are directly west of Westport, several miles to the west of the railroad. Only a glimpse of one of 
them can be had from the railroad. In the Adirondack pass in Essex County, is a perpendicular 
precipice or naked wall of rock 1,000 feet high and more than half a mile long. There is not prob- 
ably in the Eastern States an object of the kind so vast and imposing as this. Emmons, 218. 

57. Stop at Port Kent and visit the Ausable valley, which is interesting for the Ausable chasm, 
where for at least two miles the Ausable River, a large and rapid stream, is compelled to flow 
through a rocky gorge in the 2 b. Potsdam sandstone with perpendicular walls of 100 feet with a width 
only varying from 20 to 40 feet. Here the lingula antique, is found in great abundance, and there is 
here a better development of the Lower Silurian or Cambrian rocks than in any other part of the 
State. Emmons, 267. Lingula and trilobites near foot of Cathedral rocks. 

68. The 3 b. Chazy formation was named from this locality. Off line of R. R. are abundant 
Chazy fo-siN, Madura Rhynchonella, etc. See Note 55. Also as to Isle La Motte see Note 67. 

59. The rock which forms Diamond Inland in Lake George is a good example of 3 a. Calcifer- 
ous. Lake George is 30 miles long, 1% miles wide, and its surface is about 80 feet above tide water.

60. This railroad cuts through Trenton, Calciferous and Potsdam within less than 10 miles of 
Saratoga. Fine sections of ripple marked Potsdam in railroad cut in Greenfield. The Ausable chasm 
is repeated at the High Falls of the Hudson at Luzerne or Hadley station on the Adirondack Rail- 
road, in Warren County, where the river flows for a mile through a gorge at the junction of the 
Potsdam sandstone and the gneiss. The walls rise in some places to a height of one hundred feet. 

61. Potsdam. This is the locality which gave the name to the Potsdam sandstone. See the 
description of that formation in another part of this volume. 

62. Trenton Falls. For about three miles between Trenton Falls station and Prospect station and 
a mile or two east of the railroad, the East Canada Creek has cut a passage through the Trenton 
limestone, the sides of the excavation rising vertically with an average height of over 100 feet. In 
this passage are the Trenton Falls or Cascades which have given so much celebrity to the place, just- 
ly meriting by their number, beauty and position, the admiration they receive. Including the one 
at Prospect Village there are six falls, five of which are placed at intervals somewhat regular and 
occupy the middle part of the excavation. The rock is m thin layers of from 6 to 10 inches in thick- 
ness, separated by thin layers of shale, and contains trilobites in prodigious numbers. The forma- 
tion derives its name from this place. It is 500 feet thick and about seven miles in breadth. Going 
east or south it grows thinner and is about 30 feet thick in the Mohawk Valley. The stone quarried 
at Prospect and used at Utica, is the upper part of the Trenton, which is here of a gray color and of 
a more solid an9 crystalline structure and appearance. Going on north by this railroad you travel 
for many miles^bn a terrace of the limestones of this group, forming the banks of Black River, 
which has its rdcky channel in this formation all the way to Watertown, with three important falls 
at Lyons, Carthage and Watertown and many cascades. Very picturesque scenery and interest- 
ing geology, with an abundance of fossils. 

63. Boonville. The first range or clift of limestone on Black River, extending by the side of the 
river from opposite Boonville to Watertown, is the Birdseye limestone. It is of a light dove color 
which by long exposure to the weather becomes of a light ash gray or white. It is in thick, straight 
layers, with straight, vertical joints, giving the rock when quarried the appearance of a wall, and it 
has a compact grain and smooth fracture. 

64. At Lyons Falls, Black river falls effect over gneiss or 1 a. Laurentin rock. Thence to;; 
Carthage it falls but feet and there is another fall over gneiss rock. 

65. The high hills west of Martinsburg are of the Hudson River group.

66. The Laurentian rocks cover the whole of the country east of the Black River and the Inter 
brmation* west of the river, the opposite sides forming the strongest contrast imaginable as to 
Jjk0 t 8oil, vegetation and population. 

67. At Watertown the hanks of the Black River present fine sections of the limestone visible 
rom thf r-ar windows, showing the Trenton limestone, Black River limestone and the Birdseye 

rming the Black River sub-division, known toquarrymen as the seven 

eet tif-r, lying between the Birdaeye and Trenton limestone. At the Isle LaMotte, near Chazy. in 
Lake Champlain, it is a black marble, but at Watertown it is only suitable for ordinary purposes.

The Falls of Black River in Watertown are 35 feet perpendicular over the limestones at the Suspen- 
sion Bridge, and 112 feet within the city limits in six separate falls. Good locality for fossils. 

68. There are two miles of rapids in Salmon River, which terminate in a fall of 107 feet. At 
high water the sheet of water is 250 feet wide, and at low water about half that extent. The fall is 
over the grey sandstone of the 5 a. Medina, and is seven miles northeast from Richland. 

69. Adams. The Gulf of Loraine, on South Sandy Creek, is a genuine canon upon a small stream 
flowing through the Loraine or Hudson River slates, Utica slate and Trenton limestone in the town 
of Loraine, from which some geologists prefer that name for the formation. The walls are perpen- 
dicular and vary in height from 100 to 300 feet, and the gulf varies in width up to 16 rods. There are 
several of these&quot; gulfs in Jefferson County, some of them 12 miles in length, reaching to the starting 
points of the streams. A convenient place to study the Loraine shales, a huge mass of mud rock, 
is the pleasant village of Adams. There are two of these gulfs within two miles southeast in the 
town of Loraine, but not on the stream in the village, which is on Trenton limestone. On the way 
observe a remarkable moraine of naked Laurentian boulders, some of them very large. This ridge 
crosses the railroad just south of Adams, where are many boulders In the fields, and is said to ex- 
tend from Lake Ontario south of Woodford northeast into Canada. The ridge road, which runs all 
along Lake Ontario, also occurs here a little nearer the lake than the ridge of boulders. 

70. The shales and sandstones at Pulaski are the upper part of the 4 c. Hudson River, which 
were at first called Pulaski Shales, or the Shales of Salmon River, and Loraine Shales. It is the only 
rock at Pulaski village and is full of fossils, while the lower or Frankfort division has yery few. 

71. Oswego. Lake Ontario, like all other New York lakes, is a lake of excavation. Along its 
northeast shore, in Canada, is the 4 a. Trenton limestone. On its south or New York shore we find 
the 5 a. Medina sandstone extending from Oswego, the whole length of the lake to Hamilton in 
Canada. The lake is excavated 50 feet in the red and 100 feet in the gray 5 a. Medina formation, 
230 feet in the Hudson River and 120 feet in the 4 b. Utica slate, the whole making a thickness of 
500 feet or the real depth of the lake, the surface of the 4 a. Trenton limestone being its bottom. 
It is 180 miles long, 40 miles wide, 492 feet deep and its surface is 245 feet above tide water.

72. Midway between Watertown and Brownville the whole river falls 60 feet in less than half a 
mile, running in a gorge with high banks. 

73. Tutty. The Tully limestone, separating the Hamilton from the Genesee, which is named 
f from this place, is not seen on the railroad, but is found further to the west. Outcrop in grove S. E. 

of the village. The swamp near Preble is supposed to be underlaid by the Tully limestone. 

74. Between Syracuse and Jamesville are good natural sections of the 6. Waterlime and 9. 
Onon&apos;laga and Corniferous limestones, many quarries and natural cliffs. Beyond Jamesville observe 
the transition into the Hamilton group where the high hills begin, the Marcellus shales being 
deeply excavated. Visit Green Lake, near Jamesville. 

75. The red sandstone of the 5 a. Medina formation is well displayed at Fulton, in Oswego County, 
where it causes the Oswego Falls and forms the banks and bed of the river above and for half a mile 
below. The upper layers are covered with Fucoides Harlani, some of them of gigantic size. 

76. The 6 b. Clinton formation is named from this place. 

77. This is one of the best railroads in the State for geological observations. There are many 
points on the Cayuga Railroad where the junction of the Hamilton with the Tully limestone and of 
toe latter rock with the Genesee shale, and of the Genesee with the Portage group are perfectly seen 
in juxtaposition. The lake affords every evidence and facility for geological sections, with fossils. 

78. Cayuga Lake is 40 miles long, 3&apos;% miles wide, 390 ft. deep, and its surface is 376 ft. above 

79. The gypsum beds are finely displayed just north of Union Springs, and large quantities are 
produced for market. South of the town the g.Upper Helderberg range crosses, and causes an islet 
In the lakf. Its lower layers, the Onondaga limestone, make beautiful quarries. 

80. The low clayey land extending nearly to Levanna is on the 10 a. Marcellus shale. The first 
rock south of this is the dividing line between the Marcellus and Hamilton. 

81. The 10 b. Hamilton presents its first bluff south of Aurora, 20 to 50 feet high, containing 
numerous fossils. Further south are many others, some of them 100 feet high, extending for miles. 
Nothing could be finer than thesei geological sections of the Hamilton. 

82. The Tully limestone first appears at Lake Ridge, from which the station is named. It is the 
dividing line between the 10 b. Hamilton and the 10 c. Genesee. It dips as you go sooth and rises 
again. This looks like a flexure of the formations, but it is caused by the change In the course of

the lake. After rising again it forms a beautiful coping of the Hamilton group for miles above 


Taughannock. See the description of the 10 b. Tully limestone. 



83. This is one of the best localities of the Hamilton group which we know. South of Ludlow- 
ville the 10 c. Genesee shale appears above the Tully limestone. It is uniformly black, of a slaty 
structure, fine grained, a hard and brittle mud rock, its edges resisting the weather, but its surface 
when exposed falling into pieces. You get a good section of the base of the Portage here. There 
is a well marked dividing line here between the Genesee and Portage, being a sandstone 2 or 3 feet 
thick, very compact and solid, with its under surface filled with fucoids raised in relief, one or two 
inches long with their ends depressed. The eye readily follows it as it dips toward the water. 

84. Every part of the Portage groupcan be inspected in the ravines and water falls in the vicinity 
of Itha-. 

85. There is a glen here, one mile southeast from the station, quite equal to that at Watkins. It 
is also in the Portage. See Note 86. 

86. Watkins Glen is in the 11 a. Portage. It is a great wonder and very beautiful. There is a 
grand view of the chasm in crossing the bridge over it at Glen Bridge on the Syracuse, Geneva A 
Corning Railroad. The gulfs on that road are perfectly characteristic of the Portage group.

87. The outlet of Crooked Lake from Penn Van to Dresden is through the Genesee slate, Tully 


limestone, and the upper part of the Hamilton all finely displayed. Crooked Lake is 20 miles long. 
one mile wide, loo feet deep, and its surface i* 718 feet above tide water. Its northern half is divided 



a Viluff of Portage (800 feet high) into two branches one of them 12 and the other 8 miles long. 

88. Canandaigua Lake is 14 miles long, from one to two miles wide, its surface is 608 feet above 
le, and it* greatest depth is loo feet, but it is very shallow at both ends. It is excavated from the 
imilton and Portage groups. 

89. The drift described in note 31 extends nearly to Dresden.&amp;&gt;. The D., L. A W. From Binghampton to Buffalo is by Prof. H. S. Williams of Cornell Uni-

91. Just south of the Erie Canal there is a deep cut in a bluff of Waterlime Group. 

92. Picturesque view of Pompey Valley. 

93. Cazenovia Lake is a beautiful lake, 4% miles long, % mile wide, and 70 feet deep, 1,189 feet 
above tide water, and is excavated in the Hamilton group. It discharges its waters into Chittenango 
Creek, which runs northward. 

94. Lebanon and Earlville are both good localities for Hamilton fossils. 

95. Extensive and beautiful view extending over Oneida Lake. 

96. Canaseraga Falls similar to Chittenango Falls. Note 97. 

97. The Falls are in sight in the valley to the west. Here Chittenango Creek falls 120 feet per- 
pendicularly into a canon over the 9. Onondaga limestone, with the Corniferous bed over it, which 
forms the sides of the creek at the top of or above the Falls. Under the Onondaga limestone is the 
Oriskany sandstone, only six inches thick. Above the Falls the creek flows through a small, hand- 
some valley, its lower sides formed of Marcellus, and the tops of the hills Hamilton. 

98. Moravia is an excellent locality for Hamilton fossils. The Tully limestone, the dividing line 
between the Hamilton and Genesee, is halfway up the hill sides, and appears to dip below the valley 
north of Locke. It is met with at the falls of Dry Creek, south of Moravia. 

99. Owasco Lake is 10 miles long, a mile and a half wide at the north at Auburn, and a half mile 
at the south end, and 750 feet above tide water. The whole of the lake is in the Hamilton group. 

100. Marl is here taken from the bottom of ponds; dried like bricks, and burnt into lime. 

101. From Bloomingburg tunnel to Sidney, the geology is the same as from Port Jervis to Sus- 
quehanna on the Erie Railway. In the hills at Port Jervis, fossils of L. H., Oriskany and Hamilton. 

102. Oneida Lake is 19 miles long, 6 miles wide, its greatest depth not over 40 feet, and in gener- 
al it is quite shoal. Its surface is 367 feet above tide water. It is excavated in the 5 b. Clinton group 
the rocks of which appear on its south shore and west end. Its north shore is covered with sandy 
alluvium which is 100 feet deep at the east end and furnishes glass sand used in the glass factories 
in this vicinity. 

103. The Erie railway tunnel at Jersey City is through Bergen Hill, which is the southern end 
of the mountain ridge of basalt or trap rock of the 16. Triassic age, 48 miles long, known farther north 
as the Palisade Mountain. See note 5.

the wonder of strangers, contain from 250,000 to 300,000 acres or from 400 to 470 square miles. Future 
generations may build dikes and reclaim them, but at present they are dismal swamps without a 
single tree or shrub, and wholly impassable to either man or beast. The two hills which rise abruptly 
in the salt meadow south of the Erie Railway and north of the Pennsylvania Railroad, are called 
Big Snake Hill and Little Snake Hill. The large one is half a mile long and 200 feet high. Both of 
these hills are outbursts of trap from between the underlying sandstone strata, similar to the Pali- 
sade Mountain. 

Suffern to Greenwood. Here is a long natural gap through the Laurentian Highland range or 
Ramapo Mountains.

106. Otisville. A short distance west of Otisville the Hudson River Slates are seen in contact! 
with the Shawangunk Grits along a fault line. This is the dividing line between two of the great 
geological groups or periods, the Lower Silurian and Upper Silurian. In a moment the whole char-.j 
acter of the country is changed from cultivated grazing land on the Hudson River slates, the Orange 
County milk country to the east of this line, to a poor, barren, rocky region on the Oneida or Shaw- ] 
angunk and Medina formations, showing in a striking manner how the character of the country de- 
pends on its geology. In descending the Shawangunk Mountain towards Port Jervis there is an al- 
ternation of beds of the Oneida conglomerate, which is of a light gray color, and the Medina sand- ; 
stone, which is of a high red color. Some pockets of galena were discovered and mined here, but&apos; 
were soon exhausted. At Port Jervis we are in the Hamilton, a formation producing a country cap- 
able of supporting a population. The intermediate formations are very thin and compressed together* 

107. Lackawaxen. From Port Jervis to Narrowsburg, the Delaware River and Erie Railwajfa 
pass through a deep and crooked gorge about 25 miles long, exhibiting some of the wildest scenery 
in the country. The railroad is cut out of rock in many places and overhung as it were by ragged 
precipices. 

108. Binghampton. West of Susquehanna the Erie Railway and its branches run for more than SOOfl 
miles on the 11 b. Chemung formation. Most of it is a fine fertile country with some handsome towns, 

the largest of which are Elmira and Binghampton, in valleys filled with gravel alluvium, and the 
higher country formed of-the calcareous Chemung shales, is quite productive, much of it being a 
good grazing country; but there is no variety in its geology. East of Susquehanna the Chemung 
formation is composed of harder sandstone. It con tains less calcareous shale, and the soil is poor. The 
country improves rapidly going westward from Susquehanna. See also 185. 

109. Just west of Waverly are the Chemung Narrows, where 100 feet of rock are exposed. The 
quarries have produced an abundance of characteristic fossils of the Chemung group in their great- 
est beauty and perfection, the formation having been named from this locality. Five miles south 
of Waverly the opening of the Susquehanna Valley may be seen, where the Chemung River from the 
west and the Susquehanna from the east unite and traverse the State of Pennsylvania to Chesapeake 
Bay. At the west end of Waverly Village is a curious flat-topped hill, about 60 feet high, called 
&quot;Spanish Hill.&quot; It is an eddy hill of gravel formed in the drift period ; but it can be seen to better ad- 
vantage on the south side, at Sayre on the Pa.&amp;N. Y. R. R. and the G. I.&amp;S. R. B. There is a simi- 
lar eddy hill in the village of Union. The plain at Sayre is &quot;Valley Drift.&quot; 

110. Portage. Here the railroad crosses the very deep gorge of the Genesee River on a high iron 
bridge 820 feet long and 235 feet high. There are three falls within a distance of two miles which

soui&gt;f through this deep gorge and over these three successive cascades, descending more than 500 
feet, and passes out into the Valley of the Genesee at Mount Morris. The gorge is 20 miles long 
river, or 14 by the public road, and its depth in some places is not less than 350 feet, its width 
only about GOO feet, and the banks nearly perpendicular. The place is well worth a visit. It is cut 
out of the 11 a. Portage group, except tne lower end, which is in the 10 c. Genesee shale. The

Limestone.&lt;northwest to the mouth of the gorge, where the Genesee River, after running 20 miles through the 
deep canon from Portage, breaks out into the beautiful broad and fertile Genesee Valley. There in 
a good section close to the bridge over the river. Get a boat and row one mile up the pool of the State 
dam, which flows to the foot of the precipices all that distance. This is the finest exposure of the 10 
c. Genesee in the State, the typical locality from which it was named, and the scenery is in itself re- 
markably good. The cliffs are 100 to 200 feet perpendicular, full of Septaria, like flattened cannon 
balls sticking in the walls. It is curious that so soft a shale rock should stand the weather so well 
and not form sloping banks when the edges only are exposed. See note No. 110, Portage. 

113. Dansville is in a beautiful ampitheatre of Portage hills with very picturesque views fronaH 
the Water Cure and other elevated points. Moranic Kame-like hills of glacial origin. 

114. The Rosendale Cement, manufactured near Rondout, is from the 6. Waterlime rock, which ] 
is here between the Medina sandstone and the Lower Helderberg limestone, the intermediate form 
mations being wanting. It is a light blue, fine grained limestone, with smooth conchoidal fracture. 
The same formation furnishes the Hydraulic Cement, made at Syracuse, N. Y., and elsewhere. 

115. Jamestown. Chautauqua Lake is 18 miles long, 2 miles wide, 1291 feet above tide water and 
726 above Lake Erie. Its northern extremity is only Smiles from Lake Erie, and yet it empties its 
waters by the Conewango, Allegheny, Ohio and Mississippi into the Atlantic. It is a beautiful sheet 
of water, bounded on its eastern side by gravelly sloping oauks, and on the west by more level and 
in some places marshy shores It is excavated in the Cnemung group, the Portage being along its 
outlet and on the shores of Lake Erie below, but of much less thickness than further east. 

116. Cornwall. Just south of this station contact of the Trenton slates (See Note 142.) and the 
Archaean rocks of the highlands: the former overturned and dipping beneath the latter. See also

118. New Hamburgh. Wappinger Creek, entering the River here is bordered for nearly its 
entire course of thirty miles from Stissing Mountain, mostly on west, by ridges of limestone. 
This belt of limestone, like another one lying further east along the Harlem Railway, traverses 
the Hudson River shales of the County from N. E. to S. W.; like the shales, it consists of denuded 
folds, dipping mainly eastward, often forced over so as to overlie the younger slates. These 
lime-tones have lately been proved, on the evidence of fossils, to comprise at least the following 
formations: 
1. Strata of associated limestone and quartzose rock, of the Lower Cambrian, containing Olen- 
ellus trilobites. These are best seen at the bases of Stissing and Fishkill Mountains. 



Limestones and calcareous shales of Middle Cambrian or Paradpxides horizon. 

3. The Upper Cambrian, or Potsdam, arenaceous limestones interstratified with calcareous shales 
and sandstones. 

4. A prominent stratum, probably Calciferous, but containing mostly a new and unique fauna. 
Its most characteristic locality is Rochdale, four miles northeast of Poughkeepsie. 

5. Trenton limestone, with a fauna of Canadian type, shown at Rochdale and Pleasant Valley.

This limestone crosses the Hudson Hirer obliquely in two strips, between Hampton, _ 
south of Marlborough). and Danskammer Point. At the north end of the New Hamburgh tunnel, 
the limestone is well shown overlying, by inversion, the Hudson River shale. 

The shales throughout this County are mainly of the Hudson River Group, with here and 
there Graptolitic layers, which are by some geologists assigned to the Utica slates. W. B. L&gt;.

119. Poughkeepsie. From the north end of the New Hamburgh tunnel, with the exception 
of a short strip of Potsdam limestone a little south of Camelot, Hudson River shales and grits 
occupy continuously the east bank of the River as far as Rhinecliff and beyond, passing under 
the city of Poughkeepsie. Also they form the west bank from Hampton to Rondout. At sev- 
eral points there appear, without any definite divisional lines, layers of graptoliyc shales which 
pome geologists consider characteristic of the Utica Slate. Such layers occur in the R. 
R. cuts at the dock opposite the N. Y. State Hospital for the Insane, and at West Park on the 
west bank above the City. 

At a point immediately south of the Driving Park, and on the Spackenkill road are localities 
of fossiliferous Potsdam. At the first point there is a conspicuous fault between the Potsdam 
and Hudson River Groups, which continues three miles southeasterly, striking the river in a 
bold bluff south of Camelot Here are extensive and valuable beds of moulding sand, which 
are evidently in part at least derived from the disintegration of the Potsdam arenaceous lime- 
stone. This fault is a part of the great system of faults described in Note 8. W. B. D. 

120. Schodack Landing. The Hudson River shales in the neighborhood abound in graptolites 
and about a mile and a half south are overlaid in apparent conformity by schists and limestones, 
containing fossils of the Lower Cambrian group, the latter rocks making the third promontory along 
the R. R. track south of the station. When the foliage is absent, the line of contact of the two 
groups can be seen from the cars. S. W. FORD. 

121. Albany. Two miles below Albany at Kenwood in ravine near Knitting Mill is the fa- 
mous locality for the Norman&apos;s Kill graptolites in Utica Slate. Beds nearly covered by buildings 
at present. The bed is seen near the middle of D.&amp;L. R, R. cut. R. P. W. 

Champlain deposits here. T. C CHAMBEBLIN.

122. The limestones and sandstones used for flagging and building in the various cities 
along the line of the N. Y. C.&amp;H. R. R. R.. are as follows: At Albany and Schenectady, 4c. Hud- 
son River; Utica and Rome, 4 a. Trenton limestone, generally of the Birdseye portion, which 
produces the thickest stone; at Syracuse, Auburn and Geneva, the 9. Upper Helderberg, generally 
the Onondaga or lower portion of it; from Rochester to Buffalo the 5 a. Medina sandstone is the 
favorite for these purposes. Some 5. Niagara limestone are used at Rochester and 9 Upper 
Helderberg or Corniferous at Buffalo, especially for lime burning. But the best flagstones are 
from the Hamilton and Chemung formations, and generally come from the shores of Cayuga 
Lake. Large quantities of flagstones are also brought from the upper part of the Hamilton group 
in the higher parts of the Helderberg, and from the same geological position along the west 
side of the River Hudson from below Catskill as far as Kingston. 

123. By Mr. Nelson H. Darton, of the U. S. Geological Survey. Mr. Darton prefers to use 
the term 4 a. Trenton rather than Hudson River for the wide areas of slates in Orange and ad- 
jacent counties, which contain a mixed Hudson River and Trenton limestone fauna, but for the 
sake of uniformity Hudson River is used throughout the chapter. 

124. Meadow Brook. About three-fourths of a mile east, the railroad crosses the ridge de- 
scribed in note 126. The red grits near this station are the some as those in the ridge there de- 
scribed, brought up by a synclinal. N. H. D. 

125. Caledonia and Stafford, two of the best places in the State for silicified Upper Helder- 
berg corals. Akron also. Excellent corals at Le Roy. R. P. W. 

12G. Cornwall. Just west of this station is a ridge composed of red and grey conglomerates 
similar to those near Highland Mills and probably near Oneida in age. It is flanked on the western 
side by Lower Helderberg limestone from the Waterlime to the Delthrysis shaly limestone, the 
latter holding a bed of Limonite and plentiful fine casts of about a hundred varieties of fossite. 
The occurrence of this fossiliferous rock so far from the main mass of the formation is very in- 
teresting. See also Note 124. N. H. D. 

127. Passaic. South of this station the palisadal front of the First Watchung or Orange 
Mountain is in sight. This long canoe-shaped ridge and some others behind it to the west and 
south are capped by the outcropping edges of great sheets of basalt lavas, which were outpoured 
at intervals on the floor of the Triassic sea during the deposition of the formation. The upper 
surfaces of these sheets, when not too deeply eroded, are deeply vesicular and at some points 
they are exposed in contact with unaltered snaly sediments. The more or less vesicular and alt- 
ered bases of tfiese sheets lie with perfect conformity on the shales, which often extend for 
some distance up the steep sides or the ridges and dip at low angles westward. Basal contacts 
in the quarries on the ridge slopes southeast of Paterson may be seen from the cars and are 
fine exposures in the deep gorge, into which the Passaic River falls in crossing the First Wat- 
chung ridge in Paterson. N. H. DARTON. 

128. Turner&apos;*. On emerging from the highlands north of Greenwood the line of the road pass- , 
es over a broad valley encirling and extending northeastward from Turner&apos;s, and is in greater part 
underlaid by limestones of undetermined, but probably Lower Silurian age, and by slates of Tren- 
ton age. N. H. D. 

129. Monroe. A mile west of this station a synclinal holding Middle Devonian is crossed, but 
no outcrops are visible from the cars. These rocks extend for many miles southward into New 
Jersey. In New York they form Bellvale Mountain to the Erie R. R. and thence extend northward 
in the high, rough, double crested ridge known as Schunemunk Mountain. The lower members 
are flagstones and slates, the upper a coarse pebble conglomerate. In a flagstone quarry, two miles 
N. N. \V. of Monroe, the remains of Devonian plants are quite abundant. In the valley wentward 
the series is underlaid by a white Quartzite succeded by limestone holding an Upper Silurian 
fauna and an unfossiliferous limestone lying on Gneiss. The two last are exposed in the railroad cut 
a mile east of Oxford. This gneiss is flanked on the west by an inconsiderable thickness of lime.- 
stone winch is overlaid by the slates which are thence exposed nearly to Oxford. N. H. D.

131. Suffern. A short distance east is Union Hill composed of a thin sheet of trap lying 
upon heavy beds of Conglomerate. N. H. D. 

132. Sparkill. At many points south of here overlying stata are found in contact with 
Palisade trap sheet, as stated in Note 5. North of this station the R. R. crosses the sheet and 
skirts the east side of the ridge at a considerable altitude. The under contact of trap and 
sandstone maybe found near Piermont-on-the-Hill, and near Grandview, above the R. R. N. H. D. 

133. Homestead. See Note 5. This road crosses the Palisade trap ridge in the Erie tunnel 
and skirts its western base to Sparkill where it recrosses to Piermont. A few hundred yards S. 
E. of the station, and in sight from the cars, contact of trap and overlying shales is exposed in 
a small quarry. N. H. D. 

134. New Durham. Three-fourths of a mile east in a cut at entrance to W. S. R. R. tunnel 
the dike structure of Palisade trap is exposed at unconformable contact with overlying sand- 
stones. N. H. D. 

135. Oranton. A short distance north is a small 4 ike and sheet of trap separated from the 
Palisade sheet by a slight thickness of sandstone. N. H. D. 

I3&gt;i. By Prof. H. S. Williams, of Cornell University. 

1:57. Rochester. Shales below falls filled with corals and Braehiopods of Niagara group. En- 
anton exposed and many layers filled with excellent fossils. Several beds of graptolites 
known by the black color of the seam. Lower fall gives limestone filled with Pentamerous Elong- 
atus and below Medina sandstone with fucoides, etc. R. P. WHITFIELD. 

See Note 36 and Glacial Note 181. 

138. Newburgh. The city rests upon strata which are evidently similar to those identified 
in Duchess County. The entire water-front is composed of Hudson River shale, while that part 
of the city west of West street is on the belt of limestone which crosses ;the river from New 
Hamburg in Duchess County. On the river road three miles north of the city, there are highly 
fossiliferous ledges of the Trenton group, containing the Coral Solenopora Compacta, and very 
large Crinoid columns. With this exception this great belt of limestone from Hampton to Long 
Pond appears to be entirely without fossils. A comparison with the more northern ex- 
tension of the belt makes it probable that besides the Trenton, Calciferous and Cambrian strata 
are present. Snake Hill to the south and Cronomer&apos;s Hill to the west, are Archsean 
gneiss. W. B. D. 

139. Mt. Joy. Road crosses Palisade trap sheet. 

140. Eagle Bridge. At Eagle Bridge, Cambridge and Granville, the railroad passes over a 
narrow strip of Hudson River Shales flanked on either side by broad masses of Lower Cam- 
brian or &quot; Georgia &quot; shales and limestones, which are not more than a mile distant, or less. 
At Salem a broad belt of Hudson River shale lies a short distance to the west. Fossiliferous 
localities of the Lower Cambrian have been found near Shushan, Salem, Rupert and Granville. 
(Some of the chief localities described are one mile south of Shushan one and one-half miles 

.ea-t and west, and one mile south of N. Greenwich (near Salem) two miles south of North 
Granville, and at Low Hampton, just west at the crossing of Poultney River.) W. B. D.

141. Warwick. At Edenville, four miles west, compare the &quot;blue limestone&quot; of Primor- 
dial or Lower Silurian age with the &quot;white limestone&quot; of the Archaean, which there crop out 
in parallel and almost contiguous ridges. The Archsean limestone is highly crystallized and 
contains many crystals of foreign matter. W. B. D. 

142. This series of slates, occupying large areas in Orange County, New York, and extend- 
ing southward into New Jersey, contains a mixed Hudson River and Trenton limestone 
fauna, and should perhaps be designated Trenton. (See Note 123.) N. H. D. 

143. West Shore R. R. Stations from Weehawken to Nyack Turnpike are by Prof. W. B. 
Dwight of Vassar College, thence to Cornwall by Mr. Nelson H. Darton, U. S. Geologist, 
thence to Esopus by Prof. Dwight, and thence to Albany by Prof. Dwight and Hon. James 
G. Lindsey of Rondout. From Albany to Buffalo the tables are by Prof. H. S. Williams of 
Cornell. On this portion see notes on New York Central, running nearly parallel. 

144. For stations in N. J. see also New Jersey Chapter. 

145. Nyack Turnpike. From some distance south of this station and thence northward, 
this road skirts the western side of the palisade trap sheet, and crossing it in a tunnel north 
of Congers, follows its eastern side to Haverstraw, where the high ridge formed by the trap, 
curves westward to the highlands. In the cut at the southern end of the tunnel the highly 
altered sedimentary beds are exposed, abutting against the steep trap dike, while on the east 
side of the ridge, they are exposed dipping gently beneath the trap, indicating the dike 
and sheet structure described in Note 5. N. H. D. 

146. Haverstraw. One mile north of the station there is a cut through 16. Triassic cal- 
careous conglomerate. A few hundred feet farther, on Stony Point, the deep cut gives fine 
exposures of some members of the Cortland series of intrusives and metamorphics. N. H. D. 

147. Tompkirfs Cove. Extensive quarries of blue and grey limestones near station. Age 
of the beds uncertain but probably Lower Silurian. They are separated from the Archaean rocks 
of the highlands by black slates of unknown age, which are exposed at many points in this 
vicinity and southward to Pompton, N. J. N. H. D. 

148. Hamburg. Eighteen Mile Creek and vicinity are most excellent localities for Ham- 
ilton fossils, along lake shore and up stream a short distance and also at Hamburg in cutting 
on R. R. (R. P. W.) 

Sub-aqueous drift; lake terraces along the lake shore to Ashtabula. (CHAMBERLIN.) 

149. Clark&apos;s Dock. Interesting clay beds of the Champlain Period deposited in the form 
of three inverted, truncated cones, instead of horizontally, as is usual in the beds lining both 
banks of the Hudson. W. B. I). 

150. Marlborough. Hampton Point, three quarters of a mile south is the northern edge of 
the limestone belt crossing from Duchess County, (See Note 118.) and passing to the west of 
Newburgh. Hre Kerr&apos;s Hydraulic Cement Works are now in successful operation. The lime- 
stone is apparently Cambrian with perhaps Lower Silurian. See Note 138. W. B. D. 

lf&gt;l. West Park. On the north side of a railroad cut just south of Hazen&apos;s (or Adam&apos;s Dock), 
and between one and two miles south of the railroad station, slabs of slate covered with excellent 
graptolites, may be obtained. These are referred by Prof. Whitfield to the Utica slate ; by 
some other geologists to the Hudson River Group. W. B. D.

152. Esopus. On leaving the river in Esopus, before crossing Rondout Creek, going north, 
the road crosses the ends of a synclinal arch; the first rock is nearly vertical section of 



tamerus, Upper Pentamerus. After crossing the creek, the road enters a tunnel the south 

: end of which is Catskill Shaly, the middle section Upper Pentamerus and the north end 

Oriskany, all nearly vertical. After the tunnel is passed the Cauda Galli is entered and per- 

haps Schoharie Grit, and then Corniferous and it may be the Onondaga. J. G. L. 

153. Kingston. Unconformability of Lower and Upper Silurian well shown here. Rpmark- 
| able contortions of strata. Fossils abundant. At Rondout, now included in the city of Kings- 
ton, are seen Hudson River Group; Oneida; Coralline limestone of Niagara Group; all the di- 

! vision? of Lower Helderberg; Oriskany; Cauda Galli and Corniferous; all but the last two 
quite fossiliferous. At old Kingston, on Esopus Creek, Marcellus and Hamilton. Immense 
Cement quarries in Helderberg limestones. 

See &quot;Non-conformity at Rondout &quot; by W. M. Davis, Am. Journ. Science, November, 1883. 

Station is on terrace of Alluvium and Drift overlying Corniferous, which crops out in a 
high ridge to the eastward, dipping to the northwest. To the west bluff of Marcellus over- 
i lying Corniferous. J. G-. L. 

154. Mount Marion. The road (going north) continues on Corniferous nearly to Saugerties, 
t where it comes again to the Cauda Galli and, before it reaches West Camp, it passes back 

over all the intervening layers to the Hudson River which it does not leave, except a few 
cuts into the Waterlime between West Camp and Catskill. J. G. L. 

At Glenerie a little over a mile southeast from Mount Marion station along the east bank 
of Saugerties Creek, are abundant exposures of Oriskany, crowded with finely weathered 
fossil&quot; . B. D.

157. Ciinandaigua. Go up the lake six miles to Monteith&apos;s Pt. up ravine, most excellent 
Hamilton fossils, all classes. Also all along lake shore to Black Pt. Heads of Monteith&apos;s ra- 
vine, Genesee slate with plants, and gas springs. R. P. W. 

158. Knowersville and Guilderland. Go up mountain to first plateau, rocks filled with Low- 
er Helderberg fossils. Tentacutites and Leperditia at base of vertical layers. Thompson&apos;s Lake 
one and a half miles back from top of bluff at Indian Ladder road, Schoharie grit and Up- 
per Helderberg fossils. Also Clarksville 12 miles southwest of Albany has yielded immense num- 
Sers of Lower Helderberg Bryozoans and Corals. R. P. W. 

159. Schoharie. In the hill east and west from the village the entire Helderberg series 
occurs, and fossils are numerous in the Coralline limestone. Lower Helderberg, Oriskany sand, 

\ Schoharie grit and Upper Helderberg. R- P. W. 

1JO. Darien. Best locality in the state for Hamilton in streams at Darien City, and also 
{ two miles west of Darien Centre in small stream at Milldam, and for one mile below slate 
j road Corals and Shells. R. P. W. 

101. The formations are given on this road approximately, no definite information having 
been published. From Dannamora to Lynn Mt. both the Laurentian and the Potsdam are 

given, implying that both strata are in the neighborhood. W. B. D. 

!&apos;_&apos;. Revised by Prof. C. H. Hitchcock. From Pawling to Chatham Prof. Dwight prefers 
. &quot; Caloiferous &quot; or &quot; Calciferous-Trenton.&quot; This limestone, he says, is the eastern fork of the Copake- 
i Hillsdale belt of which the Wappinger Valley limestones are the western fork. Calciferons fossils 
J occur in it. Cambrian strata may be present. At North East Center, one and one-half miles south of 
B Miller-ton, Calciferous fossils occur on Edward Clark&apos;s farm.

163. Williamstown. An important point in the typical area of the original Taconic Series. 
Recent researches of laborious stratigraphic and paleontological field-work, have at last result- 
ed in securing, in general, a well-assured stratigraphy for this entire Taconic region includ- 
ing the great synclinals of limestones, shales, schists and quartzytes of the central moun- 
tain ridges and the adjacent rolling country on the east and west flanks. The most recent and 
extensive discoveries of fossils were made by Mr. C. D. Walcott in 1887 and in one or two 
years previous. Stratigraphic maps have been lately published by Prof. J. D. Dana, and by 
Mr. Walcott. These show beyond question that the main central ridges of Taconic rocks con- 
sist of Potsdam, Calciferous, Chazy, Trenton and Hudson River strata, flanked on the east by 
a belt of Potsdam and pre-Cambfian rock, and on the west by a wide belt of Lower Cam- 
brian somewhat intermixed with Hudson River Shales. 

Some of the principal localities of fossils are at Pownal, and three miles south of Ben- 
nington, Vt., north side of Graylock Mt., Mass, near Hoosac, and Hoosic, N. Y. and at other 
points for which see Note 140. W. B. D. 

164. By Prof. W. B. Dwight, of Vassar Collge. 

165. Pleasant Valley. Fossiliferous Trenton in cut near north of depot and in quarry, one half 
mile south. Calciferous limestone in ridges west of the Trenton, at quarry, etc. Fossiliferous 
Potsdam limestone a little northwesterly from railroad station. Hudson River shales on each 
side of the belt of these limestones. About half way between this and Salt Point fossilifer- 
ous Potsdam mainly composes hill on east side of the railroad near the school house. W. B. D. 

166. Salt Point. Limestone belt passes to east of depot through Hudson River shales. At- 
Clinton Corners passes west of station. Exposure of Trenton and Calciferous limestone with 
a little Potsdam at Wallace&apos;s quarry one mile south of Salt Point. W. B. D. 

167. Clinton Corners. Limestone of Potsdam and Calciferous groups occurs northwest of; 
station. 

168. Willow Brook. A ledge of quartzite of Lower Cambrian occurs near the station to^j 
the southwest and some of the limestone may belong to the same horizon. 

169. Stissing. Station stands on one of the Wappinger limestones, which appears in place 
in a little gully near track and in cuts to the north and south. Being without fossils its age 
is uncertain, but probably either Potsdam, Rochdale or Trenton. Between this limestone and 
the base of Stissing Mountain (Archaean gneiss) is a strip of red shale of the Olenellus 
group. On ascending the southern slopes of the Mountain, the red shale is succeeded 
by an underlying stratum of limestone of the &quot;Olenellus&quot; group, containing Hyolithellus 
Jf ir.aus ; underlying this a little higher up the declivity is quartzose rock also of the &quot;Ole- 
nellus&quot; group and immediately overlying the gneiss. In some spots this quartzyte is ferru- 
ginous and highly fossiliferous containing Olenellus asaphoides and other fossils. W. B. D. 

170. Matteawan and Glenham. The stations (Newburg, Dutchess and Conn.) stand on 
shales of the Hudson River Group, which near Glenham become in some localities greenish 
and also bright purplish red. Ledges of an impure irregular granite appear at some points 
near Fishkill Creek surrounded by shales or limestones. On the southern side of the creek 
in Matteawan and Glenham are conspicuous ridges of limestone belonging to the Wappin- 
ger Valley series, but not yet exactly determined by fossils. On farm of Mr. Charles M. Wol- 
cott, southwest from Matteawan and three miles from the Hudson River ? quartzite of the 
Lower Cambrian crops out, immediately overlying the gneiss rock of Fishkill Mountain. 

&quot;W. B. D. 

171. Bangall. A broad belt of Calciferous and Cambrian limestones stretches northerly 
from Bangali for about a mile and a half along the Hull&apos;s Mills road; the Calciferous is quite 
fossiliferous at some points. In this vicinity there are numerous faults between the Hudson 
River Group, and the two stratigraphic components of the limestone. W. B. D.

172. Shekomeko, An independent strip of limestone about six miles Jong extends from 
le Square&quot; two mile south of Shekomeko, up the valley to Pulver&apos;s Corners. It consists 

of Calciferous, and probably the Potsdam, which runs 1 frequently into calcareous shales. At 
Husted Station, the latter formation skirts the west flank of Winchell&apos;s Mountain, and is well 
hown in a deep cut just north of the station. In a cut south of the Shekomeko Station is 
i conspicuous fault between the Calciferous and Hudson River Group, and a little further 
toouth, the Calciferous contains fossils. W. B. D. 

173. Canaan 4 Corners. The limestone belt between Canaan 4 Corners and State Line Station. 
Which with: the overlaying argillaceous and arenaceous rocks, formed a portion of the original 
&quot;Taoonic Series&quot; of Emmons, have recently been shown by indisputable paleontological evi- 

Wence to belong, in part at least, to Lower Silurian formations. Fossils have been recently 
discovered at the railroad tunnel (No. 290) and south of it, also on Browne&apos;s farm one mile 
jast of Canaan 4 Corners. These fossils indicate certainly Lower Silurian strata, probably 
of tht- Trenton and Calciferous groups. See note 163. W. B. D. 

Geology of Eastern New York. 

174. The geology of the country between the Hudson River and the Connecticut and Massa- 
:s State Line was involved in almost entire obscurity until within a few years. In the 

MM geological survey of forty-eight years ago, the slates were assigned, for stratigraphic rea- 
lons, to the Hudson River Group, and the limestones without any evidence of any value 
Derived from fossil*, was assigned to the Calciferous and Trenton groups. Afterwards, the 
entire mass of rocks was indefinitely assigned to the Quebec Group and was so designated 
n the first edition of this GUIDE. The difficulty of ascertaining the true order was much in- 
fereased from the fact that the strata are much metamorphosed, flexed and faulted. 

It H now known, on abundant paleontological evidence, that the shales and schists with 
Home attendant &quot;grits&apos;* are of the Hudson River Group, and perhaps of the Utica Slate ; and 
hat the limestones and some quartzytes are Cambrian or Silurian, that is, comprising strata 
Ifither of the &quot;Georgia&quot; [&quot;Olenellus&quot;], Paradoxides, Potsdam, Calciferous, or Trenton. 

It is certain that tne three latter formations are largely represented. The fossils are 
iilque and important, but they are in general altered, fragmentary, difficult to obtain and 
limcult to study. W. B. DWIOHT. 

A general sketch of the geology of this region is given in Notes 175 and 176 by Drs. 
unt and Dana, who represent diverse views on some of the important questions connected 
rith the stratigraphy, and much information will be found in the tables and notes on 
Utions in this region, especially in Notes 118, 119, 138, 163 and 173. 

175. To the east of the Hudson River in New York we find besides the Laurentian 
ocks of the Highlands, a great development of the gneiss and mica-schists of the Montal- 

m and of two other and very unlike series. The first of these is the Lower Taconic, con- 
sting of the Stockbridge limestone with quartzites and peculiar elates. This series together 
Ith the Primary crystaline schists, stretches up northward, passing along the southeast side 
&apos; the Highlands, and occupying portions of Eastern New York and Western New England, 
a the northwest side of the Highlands, extending northwand along the valley of the Hud- 
Hi, and as far as Lake Champlam, is found another series, variously designated as the 
Udson River Group, the Taconic Slates or Upper Taconic series of Emmons, and the Que- 
c group of Logan. These rocks have been supposed to be Upper Cambrian or Silurian, 
Jtica, Loraine and Oneida) but are now believed to be chiefly of Lower and Middle Cambrian 
fes. They are generally disturbed and often inverted, and include small outliers and in- 
olved portions of Upper Cambrian and occasionally of Silurian strata. This Upper Taconic 
1 Cambrian group is distinct from and superior to the Lower Taconic. It is impossible in 
present state of our knowledge of their distribution to define the limits of these various 
roups of strata to the east of the Hudson, or to say at what stations the Upper Taconic, 
i Lower Taconic (Taconian) or the Primary rocks are met with. T. S. Hmrr. 

NOTE. Dr. Hunt here uses the terms Cambrian, etc. as given in the first edition. See Note 2, 
so Dr. Hunt&apos;s table in the Introduction. 

176. To the north of Putnam County, N. Y., whose rocks are with small exceptions 
rchsean, there is a large development along the boundary between New York and New 
ngland of the &quot;Lower Taconic Series&quot; of Emmons, consisting of limestone, called in part 

Stockbridge limestone, with hydromica and mica-schists and quartzite. These rocka

extend northward over a portion of Eastern New York and neighboring portion of Connecticut, 
Massachusetts and the southern half of Vermont. The limestones have afforded Lower Sil- 
urian fossils in Canaan, (see Note 173), Columbia County, New York and in West Rutland 
and elsewhere in Central Vermont. The rocks near Poughkeepsie were made part of the &quot;Low- 
er Taconic&quot; and have recently afforded Lower Silurian and some Cambrian fossils. The 
slates were formerly all referred to the Hudson River Group. In Rensselaer Co., N. Y., oc- 
cur slates and other rocks made &quot;Upper Taconic&quot; by Emmons, containing Cambrian fossils 
and similar rocks occur in parts of western and northern Vermont. J. D. DANA. 

Note on the Glacial Drift on Long Island 
by Mr. Warren Upham, Assistant U. S. Geologist. 

177. On Long Island the terminal moraine of the continental ice-sheet extends from Fort 
Hamilton twenty-four miles in a nearly northeast course to Roslyn ; thence it runs nearly due 
east sixty miles to Canoe Place and the Shinnecock Hills; next it turns northeast about eight 
miles to near Sag Harbor; and thence its course is east and east-northeast about twenty-five 
to Montauk Point. This range of hills long ago was called &quot;The backbone of the island.&quot; 

From the Narrows to Roslyn, this moraine varies from 100 to 250 feet in height, is mainly 
composed of unmodified drift, upper till on the surface, with glaciated pebbles and boulders 
in deep excavations. Its irregular contour is well seen in Greenwood Cemetery and Prospect 
Park and at Ridgewood Reservoir. 

East of Roslyn it is almost wholly composed of modified drift, being waterworn grav- 
el and sand with few or no boulders. These deposits are stratified, but often with oblique 
bedding and seem to constitute the entire mass of hills from 200 to nearly 400 feet high. 
Harbor Hill, a half mile east from Roslyn is the highest, 384 feet above sea, and is of this 
kind. In the same class are Jane&apos;s Hill, 354 feet; Rutland&apos;s, 340 feet; Osborn&apos;s or Bald Hill, 
a few miles southwest from Riverhead, 293 feet, The portion of this moraine forming the 
peninsula of Montauk, ten miles long and 150 to 200 feet high, is stratified, but contains 
frequent embedded boulders, which are also spread over the surface. 

Long Island, south of this series of hills, consists of plains of fine gravel and sand 5 
to 10 miles wide and lOOj long. The north portion at the foot of the moraine is 50 to 150 
feet above sea, from which height they slope southward. Numerous ancient water courses 10 
to 25 feet deep and 100 to 300 feet wide cross from north to south. In some cases these 
channels continue beneath the the sea level of the southern bays to the beach ridge, by 
which they are divided from the ocean. 

A later terminal moraine 100 to 200 feet high, formed during a halt in the final retreat 
of the ice-sheet, of modified drift, except near Greenport and Orient, forms the north shore 
from Port Jefferson to Orient Point. It is separated from the extreme moraine by plains, also 
crossed by old channels of drainage.

NOTES ON THE TABLE op FORMATIONS. No. 21, RECENT, includes the tidal meadows, the allu- 
vial, upland necks of the southern part of the State, the sand-beaches of the Atlantic coast, and some 
of the peat-deposits of the interior. 

Under 20 B., CHAMPLAIN, are placed the modified drift bordering some of the rivers ; and deposits 
of the ancient lake basins. 

No. 20 A., GLACIAL, represents the glacial drift north of the terminal moraine. 

The YELLOW SAND AND GRAVEL of the southern part of the State is represented as PLIOCENE, 19 c. 

The MIOCENE, 19 B., is identified by its characteristic fossilsTin Cumberland County, but it is not 
on any railroad line. 

The EOCENE, 19 A., is recognized in the upper layers of the upper green-sand marl-bed. 

The CRETACEOUS, 18, includes the green-sand marls of the southern part of the State and the plas- 
tic cU}-9 here designated ae the Raritan clays. 

Under 16, TRIASSIC, the trap-rock outcrops are included with the red sandstone. 

The GREEN- POND MOUNTAIN series of shales, sandstones, and conglomerates are of Devonian 
age, but there is some uncertainty as to their true position. They are provisionally assigned to the 
Upper Devonian. 

The MARCELLUS SHALE, the CORNIFEROUS and ONONDAGA LIMESTONES, the CAUDA GALLI GBIT, 
the ORMKANY SANDSTONE, the LOWER ^HELDERBERG SERIES, and the WATER LIME group occur in 
the Upper Delaware Valley, west of the Kittatinny Mountain. No railway line runs nearer to them 
than the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway, at Carpenter&apos;s Point, and Port Jervis. 

The 3 A. E. c., MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE, is the equivalent of the calciferous sandstone of New York. 

Th.- 4 B. E. c., UTICA SLATE, has not been outlined on any of the State maps, as it is almost im- 
possible to separate it from the Hudson River slate. 

In No. 1, ARCHAEAN, the subdivision is based on lithology alone. The gneissic, granitic, syenitic, 
and other associated crystallinefrocks are assigned to the Laurentian, and the fine crystalline, horn- 
blend ic, schistose rocks to the Huronian. 

The reference to the newer and superficial formations is not made in all cases ; and the more 
characteristic and typical localities only of the Recent and Quaternary ages are given. 

Some of the stations are on the boundaries of formations and cover two outcrops. The aim is to 
give the most conspicuous and well-developed one in such localities.

logical Survey of New Jersey, Professor George H. Cook, State Geologist, and compiled by C. C. Ver- 
meule, C. E., topographer. 

1. The Archaean rocks are now all covered by improvements, and there are no outcrops ; but a 
large part of the city has this formation as its underlying rock. 

2. The Palisade range of Bergen Hill trap-rock in the western part of the cut, as seen at the tunnel. 

3. The trap-rock of the Palisade range is seen on the east side, the whole length of this road to the 
New York line. (See Note 5, under New York.) On the left are the recent formations of the Hack- 
ensack meadows. 

4. The sandstone lying upon the trap-rock can be seen on the mountain&apos;southeast of the station 
and near its crest. 

5. At the east entrance to the tunnel the indurated shale, and above it the trap-rock, can be seen. 
One mile to the south there are good exposures of the latter rock cutting across the sandstone and 
shaly rocks. And sandstone was met with in the tunnel-cutting. 

C. The sandstone on the west of the trap-rock is beautifully exposed in the west entrance to the 
tunnel . There are good sections showing glacial drift also. 

7. The recent formations of the meadows alo&apos;hg the Hackensack are seen on the left or west side 
from here to Hackensack. 

H. (See Notes 3 and 6.) 

9. The Garret Rock ridge of trap-rock is prominent in the southwest and south of the city. Pas- 
eaic Falls, where the Passaic River falls seventy feet over ledges and through fissures of trap-rock.

In Morris Hill, near the falls, fine section of sandstone and conglomerate, bedded trap-rock capped by 
the columnar trap. 

10. Columnar trap-rock seen on west of road in the second mountain range. 

11. Morainic drift surface is noticeable on north of road, from here to Oakland, where the modi- 
fied or terrace drift can be seen, thence to Pompton on the left side of car. 

1-2. Here the train approaches the gneissic rocks (1 a. Laurentian) in the eastern face of the High- 
lands. 

13. South of Pompton Junction } mile, and in the left bank of the Pequannock River, there is an 
isolated outcrop of black, slaty rock, which is probably Huronian. The locality is in sight from the 
railroad track. Graphite mine i mile south of Bloomingdale, a flag-station between Pompton and 
Butler. From Pompton to Charlotteburgh the road follows the Pequannock River, and excellent 
views of the Highland ranges are to be had from the car-window. 

14. The bold escarpment of the Copperas Mountain here comes in view, and west of this station 
the road passes through a gap in the range. It belongs to the Green-Pond Mountain series of Devon- 
ian age. 

15. Green Pond Mountain is seen to the southwest of the station. Green Pond, a beautiful, natu- 
ral lake, 1,048 feet high, is three miles south of Newfoundland. 

16. East of Stockholm the line re-enters the outcrop of the Laurentian rocks, and runs thence over 
them to Franklin Furnace. 

17. The railroad line here runs on a remarkable moraine, which, excepting the narrow passage for 
the Wallkill, stretches across the valley and is one hundred or more feet high, affording pretty views 
on each side. West of the station there are cuts hi the white, crystalline limestone. The Sterling Hill 
zinc-mines are southwest of the station. 

18. The noted Mine Hill is northeast of and in sight from the station. The zinc-mines of frank- 
Knife ore are here. Famous mineral locality. The Potsdam sandstone is cut a few rods northwest of 
the depot. 

19. The extensive meadows of the Drowned Lands are on the east of the road. Quarries of flag- 
ging-stone on Flagstone Hill west of the station. 

20. The valley of the Wallkill River is on the west. 

21. Modified drift of Germany Flats conceals the limestone. 

22. The road here runs near the line between the slate and the magnesian limestone of the Panl- 
inskill Valley. The ridge bordering the valley on the southeast from Washingtonville to the Dela- 
ware River is slate. 

23. Near Marksboro, White Pond is noted for its shell marl deposits of Recent age. 

24. The station is on the river terrace. Northward two miles, the road enters the slate belt. Quar- 
ries of roofing-slate a little way east of the road. 

25. The railroad line follows the river through the gap in the conglomerate of the main southeast 
ridge, and then across the Medina red, gray, and olive-colored shales and sandstones. Grand scenery. 

26. The road here crosses a low, upland strip of sandstone. To the southwest are to be seen the 
Snake Hill and Little Snake Hill trap-rock hills. The meadows to the southeast and to the north- 
west are RECENT. 

27. (See Note 9.) The modified drift is beautifully exposed in hills east of the depot and in the 

28. The red sandstone is cut down deeply by the gorge east of the road. Northward to the State 
line the rock is covered by drift, and several side-cuttings show this drift. 

29. The Belleville quarries, southeast of the station, yield annually a great amount of very excel- 
lent brownstone. 4 

30. Tidal meadows to right. Sandstone ridge on left. The line follows the Hackensack and then 
the Pascack Rivers. Very few exposures of the rock ; drift surface generally. 

31. This railway west&apos;of the Erie line runs westerly, and cuts into the sandstone at the south side 
of Snake Hill, which is trap-rock mainly. West of Arlington it cuts deeply across the sandstone ridge.

A slight fault is seen in this cut. The historic Schuyler mine (copper) is one mile northeast of this 
station. 

32. The road here approaches the trap-rock range (First Mountain). 

33. The railroad line crosses the First Mountain range part way through a gap. Good exposures of 
trap-rock in cuts. Going toward Cedar Grove, beautifully glaciated surfaces and good sections of 
glacial drift on the side of track. 

34. Falls of Passaic River over trap-rock ledges in village northeast of station. Quarries in brown 
sandstone. Fine examples of trap-rock columns on shale one mile northeast of village and near the 
river. 

35. The road here passes through a gap in the Towakow-Packanack range of trap-rock and enters 
the Pompton Plains basin, a, part of the old glacial Lake Passaic. The southern portion is still wet, 
peaty meadow. Northward a gravelly plain. The Archaean highlands are seen on the left or west 
side of the plains. 

36. The isolated crests of gneissic ridges, nearly buried in the drift gravel, characterize this valley. 

37. The long-worked and celebrated iron-mines of Cooper and Hewitt are here reached by this 
branch railway. 

38. The largest lake in the State, lying between the Laurentian ridges on the east and the rough 
Bearfort and Bellvale Mountains on the west. The latter are of the Green-Pond Mountain series of 
rocks. At the south end and west side of the lake there are small outcrops of 4 c. Hudson Jiiver, 5 a. 
Oneida, and Medina. 

39. Famous basaltic columns at O&apos;Ronrke&apos;s quarry, west of the town. 

40. At Castle Point, north of ferry, serpentine outcrops. 

41. (See Note TO.) % 

42. Hills of glacial drift here are prominent ; and the terminal moraine crosses the Second Mount- 
ain range south of Summit. Thence to Morristown the southern edge of the drift is, on the average, 
a half mile south of the railroad. 

43. West of the station deep sink-holes appear near the line of road.

74. Here the road enters the German Valley, shut in by Archaean ranges of mountains. 

75. The underlying formation (presumably Archaean) is here concealed by drift. The same is true 
at the succeeding stations of Drakesville and Kenvil. The low ridges on the east of the line are of 
sandstone (Green Pond Mountain series).

86. The red sandstone forms bluffs in right bank of the Raritan, which are seen crossing the 
bridge. 

87. Low cuts here and hence to Trenton in drift sand and gravel. They conceal the underlying 
formations. 

88. The gneissic rocks are to be seen in the Delaware River above the railroad bridge. Northeast 
of the station a long cat exposes a gravel formation, which belongs to the Trenton terrace level. Mas- 
todon tusk has been found in it. Rude flint implements found by Dr. Abbott in this formation, south 
of station, in the river bluff. 

89. Center of fire-clay digging and fire-brick works. Very large banks west and south of the 
village. 

90. Southern limit of glacial drift at mouth of the Raritan River.

118. Holly Mount consists of red -sand bed capping lower marl rising above the clay-marl plain. 

119. (See Note 110.) 

120. Here, as at many localities in West Jersey, the strata are concealed ; and the dip of beds is 
so slight that there is some uncertainty in some localities what are the underlying strata. 

121. (See Note 118.) 

122. (See Note 117.) 

123. Sea-beaches (Recent). 

124. Artesian well here strikes the marl-beds after penetrating overlying gravels, sands, and clays. 

125. Or, possibly, Pliocene. 

126. Marl-pits in both the middle and upper beds in the vicinity of village. 

127. The railroad line here cuts into the stoneware clay-bed, going toward South Amboy. South- 
ward the dark-colored clays and the clay-marls are exposed in the cuts. 

128. Matavan Creek cuts into clav-marls. 

129. Railroad cut through lower bed, at station. Deep cut in red sand south, one mile. 

130. Surface clays and gravels may be Pliocene. 

131. Pits in upper marl-bed west of railroad line at Poplar, also near Deal Beach. 

132. The superficial beds are probably Pliocene. Artesian-well borings pass through these and 
reach the Cretaceous marl series. 

133. Mount Pleasant Hills (red-sand bed and lower marl) to southeast. 

134. Numerous marl-pits in vicinity, and many fossils. Red-sand bed forms hills generally. 

135. A sandy strip or beach-sand and Recent. 

136. Navesink Highlands to west of river of red-sand bed, capping lower marl. Latter is seen 
hi north or Raritan Bay side of Highlands.

NOTES OK TH TABLE or FORMATIONS. All beneath the Potsdam is styled Azoic, because no survey 
has yet sufficiently differentiated the mass into its several systems. The term Eozoic is rejected, 
partly because both too vague and too shifting, and partly because it would suit the Cambrian system 
better than the Huronian and Laurentian, both of which remain to all intents and purposes Azoic. 
The terms Huronian and Laurentian are known to apply lithologically to rock masses in Pennsyl- 
vania, but their geographical relationships in the State are but imperfectly made out. 

Much uncertainty still exists about the lines of demarcation between some of the formations 
in Pennsylvania, such as between the Catskill and Chemung; the Lower Helderberg and Clinton; 
the Hudson River and Utica; the Calciferous and Potsdam. 

Niagara, Onondaga or Salina, Corniferous and other names were omitted, in the first edition, 
because of their uncertain presence in many districts of the State ; and because of the narrowness 
of their upturned outcrops where they do exist. 

Some of the places named in the following lists occupy positions covering the width of two or 
more steeply outcropping formations, to any one of which, therefore, they might be assigned. 

In the northern and western counties it is often impossible to say precisely whether places stand 
upon Chemung, Catskill, Pocono or Mauch Chunk rocks. In such cases, Chemung has been pre- 
ferred, because the others might be studied in the surrounding hills on account of the general hon- 
zontality of the bedding. 

The last column in the table gives the numbers assigned to the Paleozoic formations in 1837, and 
their modifications since 1874. All above XII are additions.

1. Kensington. This line runs along the Delaware river over alluvion and modified glacial drift, 
based upon Azoic rocks, upon which lie the bottom layers of the Cretaceous of New Jersey. 

2. Oakland. Here the line finally leaves the Azoic rocks, across a fault, and passes white marble 
quarries to the Westchester Valley, rocks vertical, and probably identical with those of western 
Vermont. 

3. Gap. Beds of quicksand. Wharton&apos;s famous nickel mine not far off&apos;. 

4. Lemon Place. From here to Elizabethtown, over the garden of Pennsylvania, the great lime- 
stone plain of Lancaster; steep dips; plications and faults innumerable; structure difficult. 

5. Landisville. Zinc mines recently worked one mile to the east. 

6. Elizabethtown. Road runs for a mile or two along part of a greenstone trap dike, twenty miles 
long, extending from the Cornwall iron mines near Lebanon, to the Susquehanna river at Falmouth, 
and into the trap region of York County. Good place to study the action of the trap rock in metamor- 
phosing the beds of New Red. 

7. Branch Inter. South edge of the limestones of the Great Valley. 

8. Rockville. Finest section in the State here. Seven miles thickness of rock, nearly vertical, 
slightly overturned, so that the upper formations seem to plunge beneath the lower, may here be 
measured, viz : From the Hudson River slates (Siluro-Cambrian), up to the Coal Measures on the 
summit of the Third Mountain. 

9. Duncannon. Here a greenstone trap dike only 4 feet thick, crosses the road and river. It 
carries iron ore. One mile west, a coal bed is opened in the Pocono Sandstone, the representative of 
the New River Coal System of Montgomery County in Virginia. Five miles east is a curious notch 
in the summit of Peter&apos;s (Fourth) Mountain, where the Dauphin-Halifax Turnpike crosses its crest. 
The vertical wall is scored horizontally with glacial striae (t). Notice the terrace which the Catskill 
makes on the north flank of Peter&apos;s Mountain opposite Duncannon; it is the finest exhibition of 
Catskill terrace erosion in the State. See Notes 77 and 170. 

10. Millerstown. Clinton fossil ore bed extensively worked here and at Mifflin. 

11. Perrysville. Best place to study the little coal beds in Hamilton (Lower Devonian) rocks. 

12. Narrows. Long Narrows. River flows in a narrow synclinal between anticlinals of Medina. 

13. Me Veytown. Good place to study Oriskany glass sand quarries, one mile back of McVeytown 
on the opposite (north) side of river. 

* The altitudes In this chapter are taken from Report N, by Charles Allen, Assistant Geologist, 
and from other reports of the survey. The datum is high water in the Schuylkill and seven feet 
have been added to reduce to mean surface of the Ocean.

14. Mapleton. Vertical Oriskany glass sand quarry on the opposite (east) bluff. 

15. Huntingdon. Plenty of middle Devonian fossils to the south of the town, across the flat. 
One mile further on, high and picturesque pulpit rocks of Oriskany crown the bluffs on both sides 
of the river. Best view to be got by crossing the turnpike bridge at Huntingdon and riding a mile 
towards Petersburg. Fine pulpit rocks stud the crest of Warrior&apos;s ridge to the north and far to the 
north-east. 

16. Spruce Creek. To the south are the Springfield Furnace mines. To the north-east, up 
Spruce Creek a dozen miles, are the largest limonite mines of the interior of the State. 

17. Birmingham. Here Potsdam comes up in the center of the overturned anticlinal. 

18. Bell&apos;s Mills. Blair&apos;s mine, between Bell&apos;s Mills and Altoona. An open quarry in limonite on 
Ori-kany and Helderberg outcrops; very curious. Unique exposure of celestine in the bank of the 
creek below Bell&apos;s Mills. 

19. Kittaning Pt. Horseshoe Bend, on 1 gradient, cuts off the point of a spur of horizontal 
Devonian measures, between two ravines ; coal mines at the head of each ravine ; curious scenery. 

20. Lilly. Coal mines and coke ovens for miles. 

21. South Fork. The anticlinal at the Viaduct brings up the Mauch Chunk Red Shale 20 feet 
above grade, and produces the three-mile loop in the river. A very curious place. Notice the 
boulders of false bedded Pocono sandstone lying in the bed of the valley below, under the viaduct. 

22. Bolivar. A vast bed of fire-brick clay half a mile back. 

23. BlairsvilU Int. Notice the arch of Pocono and Catskill opposite. On the opposite mountain 
top lies a small patch of the lowest coal bed of the Allegheny River series. See also note 73. 

24. Latrobt. Here the Pittsburgh Coal Bed is first met the lowest bed of the upper productive 
(Monongahela River} Coal Series. Down the Loyalhanna, left bank, six miles, the hill slope is 
covered with cubic blocks of sand rock 20 feet high and 100 feet on a side, moved several hundred 
feet down a gentle slope from their original sites. 

ttsburgh. The Pittsburgh Coal Bed is seen mined at the hill tops south of the city, 350 feet 
above the Monongahela River level. At the south end of the hill behind the city, stand? an oil well 
derrick 70 feet high, 100 feet above the streets. It has been bored to a depth of 2,300 feet, through 
the Butler Oil Rocks, but yields nothing but a stream of strong brine. 

26. Sunbury. Fine cliffs opposite, west side of the river. Superb landscape from hill % mile 
back of station. 

27. Milton. In the centre of a rolling plain of Salina anticlinals and synclinals crossing the 
river from east to west, bounded on the west by anticlinal Oneida and Medina Mountains called 
the &quot;Buffalo,&quot; &quot;Seven Mountain,&quot; &quot;Jacks,&quot; ete., around the bases of which run the outcrops of the 
fossil ore. 

28. Muncy. Plenty of fossils; fine cliffs of Chernung and Portage facing the river on the east 
side. Last appearance of Silurian Mountains of Middle Pennsylvania towards the north-east the 
end of the Bald Eagle Mountain (5 a. Medina) close along the railroad. Facing the spectator, in the 
north, appears the wall of the Allegheny Mountain with patches of the lowest coal on the broken 
forest plateau above. 

29. Willicmuport. Five miles south, through a gap, lies the little secluded Musquito Valley of 
Siluro-Cambrian limestone, with black marble quarries of Trenton limestone.

Trenton fossils, etc. 

32. Queen&apos;s Run. Here the road enters the gate of the long gorge of the West Branch Susque- 
hanna, and continues in it 51 miles to Driftwood ; the floor of the gorge being sometimes Chemung 
and sometimes Catskill. Steep walls of Catskill and Pocono rocks, a thousand feet high, hem in the 
river, with its innumerable bends. Side gorges of the same nature open on both sides. On the 
hogback mountain tops between, covered with broken rocks and forest, lie patches of coal measures. 
The strata gently rise and fall in successive undulations, crossing the river at right angles. Old 
iron furnace of cut stone at Farrandsville. Total failure to work sub-conglomerate carbonate iron 
ore. Similar failure in same ore at head of Tangascowtac Creek, opposite, to the west.

50. Nanticoke. A remarkable mining accident occurred in the vicinity of Nan ticoke December 
18, 1885. The roof of a coal mine which was only three feet thick, but which was overlaid by 257 feet 
of glacial drift, caved in. The glacial gravel filled the mine and entrapped 26 miners. Exposure of i 
beds of No. XI, 500 feet thick on south side of river extending from Nanticoke gap to Shickshmny. 
The mountain on the north side of the river is made of No. X. No. XII caps the mountain on the 
south side of the river. The thickening of the red shale between Pittston and Nanticoke is gradual. 
See Note 122

79. Butler. To get to the first productive deep oil wells one must go several miles north-east 
from Butler toward St. Jo., Petrolia, etc. The road descends to the Allegheny River over lower 
coal measures. 

80. Manna. In the gap of Jack&apos;s Mountain is the spring and former residence of &quot; Logan the 
Indian.&quot; Trenton rocks form cliffs. The Kishacoquillas Valley is shut in east of Milroy by two 
remarkable &quot;ships keel&quot; (synclinal) mountains of Medina and Oneida. The hull is Oneida, the keel 
Medina. The valley and its three arms are all surrounded by terraces of erosion. Taylor thought it 
was a terrace of deposit, and that the valley had been a lake. A turnpike drive across the valley from 
Logan&apos;s Gap, north-west, by the old iron mines, and over the Standing Stone mountain, to Greenwood 
furnace, with its fossil ore mines and fine scenery will repay. A fault cuts the mountain. The 
Clinton shales are curiously crumpled in the cuttings descending to the furnace. 

81. Indiana. The barren coal measures cover most of Indiana County; underneath lie the 
Alleghenv River coal series. 

82. Laurelton, Coburn. Between Lanrelton and Coburn the road gets through the Seven 
Mountains by following the deep tranverse gorge of Penn Creek, crossing the anticlinals, which 
make the Buffalo Mountains in Union County; the last two being those of Poe Valley and Lick 
Valley. It issues at Coburn upon the wide limestone valley, full of sink holes and caves, with beds 
of limonite iron ore. Roundhead (synclinal) splits the east end. Brush Mountain forms the north 
wall. 

83. Rising Springs. Egghill to the west, a synclinal knob of Medina left standing in the valley. 
Notice Long&apos;s cave at west end of Brush Mountain, at the opening of Brush Valley. Notice sink 
hole two miles west of Old Fort, which communicates, under Nittany Mountain, with the great spring 
one mile west of Pleasant Gap. Curious eddy hill in pleasant gap. 

84. Oak Hall. Here Nittany Mountain ends, the Hudson River slates swinging round it. Oneida 
rocks on top; fine view toward Bellefonte, northward, and toward Tyrone, westward. Remarkable 
uncovered cavern, with more recent cavern under it along Big Hollow, four miles west. (See Report 
T. 4, p. 422.) 

85. Scotia. Brown hematite (limonite) iron mine. 

86. Penn. Furnace. The greatest old brown hematite mine in middle Pennsylvania. Excellent 
place to study the origin of such deposits. Other mines near the next three stations. 

87. L. and T. Junction. In the Bald Eagle Gap. 

88. Snow Shoe Int. Rocks all vertical Oriskany outcrop continuous from here eastward to 
Lockharen; none seen westward toward Tyrone.

89. Mines. One of best and largest brown hematite iron mines in Pennsylvania on the sharp 
anticlinal axis of Canoe Valley, five miles east of Hollidaysburg. 

90. Port Perry, McKeetport. Mines in the Pittsburgh coal bed line the river on both sides in a 
continuous series; the bed descending slowly from 360 feet above water level at Pittsburgh to within 
30 or 40 feet in the neighborhood of Monongahela City. The bed rises again and goes into the air, 
ascending the Youghiogheny River ; the banks becoming hillslopes of the Barren measures. 

91. Frazer. From here to Fern Hill, study the belt of South Valley Hill talcose mica slate. 

92. Fern Hill. Cross the serpentine belt. 

93. West Chester. Supposed Laurentian gneiss belt. 

94. Shawmont. Fine fresh rock cuttings of gneiss all along this part of the line; contortions; 
steatite quarry. 

95. Safe Harbor, Pequea. Iron works. 

96. McCaWs Ferry. At Toquan Creek the great anticlinal crosses the river, which runs on 
north-eastward by Quarryville and Christiania into Chester County, north of the Chester Valley. 

97. Chestnut Hill. The Valley of the Wissahiccon Creek on the west gives a fine section of the 
Chestnut Hill sub-division of the gneisses of the Philadelphia Azoic belt. 

98. Hanover June. Magnetic and limonite iron ores from one to five miles west of this and in 
the ridges to the north and south. 

99. Conewago. Cliffs of greenstone trap overhang the road and river. 

100. Goldsboro. More trap cliffs from here to Red Bank. Magnetic iron ore bed above, back 
from the river. 

101. Bridgeport. Fine long cuttings through Calciferous limestone opposite Harrisburg. 

102. Sharpsburg. Iron works here were fired by natural gas brought in a pipe, 40 miles long, 
from the great gas wells in northern Butler County long before its introduction into general use m 
or near Pittsburgh.

105. Trout Run. Entrance to the long gorge of the Lycoming Creek through the Allegheny 
Mountain plateau ; similarly situated to Queens Run (32). Gorge exactly like that of the West Branch 
Susquehanna (32). Coal patches 1,000 feet above road level, up Trout Run. 

106. Mclntyre. Old iron mines under the cliffs of Potts ville conglomerate forming the cornice 
of the mountain walls. Great incline plain up mountain to Mclntyre coal mines. 

107. Alba. The Armenia Mountain of Catskill and Pocono dominates this on the west. On its 
top is the east end of the Blossburg-Antrim semi-bituminous coal basin. 

108. Shamokin. In the gap opposite the town five ribs of Pottsville conglomerate enclose the 
four lowest anthracite coal beds. A cross section of the coal measures up to the 12th bed can be 
made here. 

109. Mt. Carmel. In the center of the Shamokin group of three anthracite sub-basins. 

110. Lykens. Here is a range of collieries on the southern outcrop of the famous Lykens Valley 
anthracite coal bed, which lies 50 or 100 feet above the Mauch Chunk red shale formation No. XI, and 
is, therefore, worked from the outside conglomerate wall of the Bear Creek coal basin. The bed 
seems to correspond to the famous block or iron furnace coal bed of Sharon in Mercer County, and 
of Nelsonville in Ohio. It is the lowest workable bed in the anthracite region.

The area of productive oil territory in the Bradford district up to January, 1885, was 121 square miles. 
and during 14 years had produced on an average 820,000 barrels of crude oil per square mile 
(C. A. Ashburner). The most productive oil region in the State, and, until the discovery of oil at 
Smethport and Kane, the lowest of the Pennsylvania oil horizons, 1,775 feet below the Glean 
conglomerate. (J. P. L.) 

113. Kinzua Bridge. Highest bridge structure in the world ; 301 feet high, 2,052 feet long ; con- 
tains 3,500,000 pounds iron ; cost 8275,000.

118. Ooldsboro. Head waters of Lehigh, on the extreme hignland, &quot;shades of death,&quot; &quot;beach 
woods,&quot; a plate of Pocono rocks covered here and there by synclinal outstretches of Mauch Chunk 
red shale. 

119. Dunnings. Commence descent into third anthracite coal field by a ravine through the 
Pottsville conglomerate. Under it the iron ore of XI has been opened. 

120. Factoryville. Now over the Elk Mountain synclinal range of Pocono in the first bituminous 
coal basin ; but no coal. 

121. Scranton to Pittston. Terraces and drift hills along railroad, also glacial striae at Pittston 
and Taylorville. 

122. Shickshinny. River cute across the coal field, leaving a small ridge of coal measures 
isolated on the west side. Here all the measures from No. X to No. XIII, inclusive, can be seen from 
the station. The Susquehanna&apos;s course through the synclinal at right angles to its axis is interesting 
here. See Note 50. 

123. Espy. Square across to the north, six miles, is seen the high end of the Shickshinny (Pocono) 
Mountain, reached by a good road from Bloomsburg, seven miles, and affording one of the finest 
panoramic views in Pennsylvania. The glacial moraine crosses that mountain from Berwick 
northward. 

124. Pittston. In the gap north of the station the red shale beds of No. XI are missing. 

125. Easton. Famous collecting ground for rare minerals. Azoic ridge to the north, with 
serpentine belt. Remarkable outcrops, natural and artificial, of the calciferous limestones along the 
river north bank to Bethlehem. Many iron works. Laurentian rocks south of the river all the way up. 

126. Bethlehem. Zinc works. Zinc mine in Saucon Valley to the south, easily reached by N. P. 
Railroad. 

1J7. Catasauqua. Perhaps the best limonite open mine In America for study, lies four miles west 
(Ironton). Best reached on wheels; also by rail, over a long, high iron bridge. Manganese, kaolin, 
lignite, with the ore. Mine very large and old. 

128. Slatington. Extensive roofing slate quarries here where the roofing slate belt from the 
Delaware river crosses the Lehigh river on its course west into Berks County. Note the duplication 
of the slate bands by anticlinals and synclinals, as described in Report D. 3,Vol. I, GeologicaI 4 Survey. 
Two miles further enter the Lehigh Water Gap between sloping walls of Oneida and Medina. Issue 
upon Clinton red shale. Notice a fine Eddy Hill opposite. Behind it is a local moraine, ? which a 
glacier, formerly descending the Lehigh, le&apos;ft across the mouth of the Aquashicola Creek, forcing that 
stream to exf .irate a new channel in the solid Medina rocks of the mountain. Two miles farther, at 
the bend of the river, north bank, the ice has crushed over the slates, polished the surface and loaded 
it with till. From the Gap Hotel ride to the top of Stone Hill (Oriskany outcrop) for the view through 
the Gap. Hydraulic lime quarries on the way up.

129. Lehighton. On the crest of one of the grandest anticlinals in the State. The gently south 
dipping Chemung and Hamilton here turn over and descend vertically. From here to Mauch Chunk 
the vertical Devonian and Bernician systems are crossed at right angles, so as to give an easy section 
of 10,000 feet, up to the coal measures. 

130. Mauch Chunk. Fine geological headquarters. The gap in the Second mountain gives the 
whole Pocono and Catskill. The river above gives the Mauch Chunk red shale. Mt. Pisgah the 
Pottsville conglomerate. Nine miles up the &quot;passenger tourist&apos;s gravity road&quot; lies the famous 
Summit Mine, mammoth coal bed, 60 feet thick, open quarry. In the gap notice the islet on which 
the very earliest anthracite iron furnace once stood. Good specimens of dendrites to be got from 
the plates in the mountain opposite the hotel. From here to Penn Haven, the fine gorge of the 
Lehigh, with its ox bow bend and walls of Catskill rocks. Glacial Moraine at Sand Run. 

131. Fair View. Ascend 400 feet higher to the summit of Penobscot Knob, affording the finest 
view in the State. Notice the glacial scratches on the rock on the highest summit of the Knob. 
From here all the colleries are visible below, and the whole structure of the third anthracite coal field 
can be made out. Down Solomon&apos;s Gap by three incline planes, notice the erosion of the red shale 
under the conglomerate cover. 

132. Wilkesbarre. Anthracite coal was first mined and used at Wilkesbarre in 1768 and 1769 by 
two blacksmiths named Gore. First shipment made to government arsenal at Carlisle in 1775. 

133. Falls. Buttermilk Falls, not the falls of that name near Stroudsburg, but in nearly the &apos; 
same rocks, with the hollows filled with gravel. 

134. McKune&apos;s. Enter the long gorge of the North branch of the Susquehanna through the 
Allegheny mountain plateau, capped (further west) by the Mehoopany coal basin. 

135. Wysauking. A small but remarkable fault in the 11 b. Chemung rocks in the Wysox 
Narrows. It slants up the hillside and may be studied on the R. R. and on the common road, 200 
feet above. The centre line of the Towanda anticlinal crosses the river at the northern end of this 
cliff, 1,050 feet above the fault. 

136. Towanda. Fine cliffs, &quot; The Red Rocks,&quot; just north of the fault and east from Wysauking 
station. Chemung fossils. Also another cliff directly opposite Towanda on east side of the river. 
Going north no such precipices are seen, the Chemung shales forming hills with rounded summits. 
Good view of Towanda village from the railroad. Boulders of white limestone from Central New 
York found in the river were formerly burnt for lime. Picturesque view at Ulster Narrows. 

137. Shenandoah. The greatest overlap in the mammoth coal bed in the Anthracite region 
occurs in the Shenandoah City colliery. See Atlas of Geological Survey, where it is fully illustrated. 

138 Barclay. Barclay or Towanda C. Co.&apos;s, Long Valley and Shraeder Mines on the top of the 
Towanda Mountain, 1,300 feet above the river at Towanda. Incline planes. High falls. Profound 
gorges splitting the mountain. Laurel swamps. Semi-bituminous coal. 

139. W. Manayunk. Beautiful ravine of the Wissahiccon to the east, deeply trenching the Azoic 
belt. ~ ....... 



t. Serpentine and soapstone quarries at Lafayette above Manayunk. 

140. W. Conshohocken. Picturesque vertical trap dyke left standing in the limestone. Marble 
quarries east and west of here. 

141. Bridgeport. On south edge of the Trias country. Bone cavern in limestone quarry near 
Port Kennedy studied by Dr. Leidy and Prof. Cope. Great limestone quarries south of the river, in 
one of which the trias beds are seen lying on the upturned edge of the old limestone beds. 

142. Valley Forge. Ditto. The hill back of it is the east end of the ridge of Potsdam sandstone 
forming the north wall of the Chester Valley far to the south-west. Under its north flank come up 
the Azoic. 

143. Phcenixville. In the tunnel here Mr. Wheatley found his coal plants (Trias) and reptile ; 
bones. Two miles south-west runs the edge or the Trias, with breccias, copper veins, etc., lying on 
Azoic. Trias continues hence to near Reading. 

144. Pottstown. Trap hills to the north.

of trap to the east. See map of the South Mountains in Report D 3, Vol. II, Part 1, Atlas Geological 
Surrey. 

146. Beading. The &quot; White Spot &quot; high on the mountain to the east is a remnant of Potsdam 
sandstone left lying unconformably on Laurentian. 

147. Port Clinton. A noble fault crosses the river three times in the gap ; once at the canal locks, 
again at the rock at the west mouth of the old tunnel, and then runs vertically up the steep. Hudson 
River slates dipping 10 south abut against the bottom plate of Oneida standing vertical. Between 
this and Auburn very fine exposures of Clinton red shales. No fossil ore. 

148. Auburn. Back of this, on the south side of Summer Hill multitudes of Hamilton and 
Chemung fossils. 

149. PottsvilU. Center of the soft anthracite colleries. Fine geological headquarters. For four 
miles before reaching this place the whole Devonian and Bernician systems stand vertical, affording 
a section of 20,000 feet of rock up to the top of the lower productive coal series in the fold of the great 
synclinal in the lower part of the town. View from the top of Sharp Mountain, 800 feet high, 
instructive. Hotel at Mount Carbon close to where Dr. Isaac Lea found fossil footprints. See 
Note 169. 

150. Allentown. Road runs along the base of the Laurentian Mountains over Calciferous 
lim--~tone holding limonite beds. 

1*1. Lebanon. Cornwall Magnetic Iron Mines six miles to the south; holds copper, trap and 
marble. 

152. Hummelton. Iron mines, limonite, south of the town. 

153. Athland. Remarkable large fossil tree stems visible in the coal measures here. Glacial 
strife (?) cross white pebbles in the conglomerate crest of mountain west of the Ashland Gap, opposite 
Mt. Carmel. 

1.54. Mahanoy. Large colleries. Shaft sunk by diamond drill. 

155. Tamaqua. Little Schuylkill here makes a cross section of the Pottsrille coal basin. Mr. 
C. A. Ashburner estimates that the center of the mammoth coal bed basin south of Tamaqua is 1800 
feet deep. 

156. Ringgold. From here down to Port Clinton the Little Schuylkill cuts through ten anticlinals. 

157. Union. All along here the thinness of the Trias upon the Cambro-Silurian is revealed by 
erosion. 

158. Ironville. Famous old and large limonite iron ore mine. 

159. Tremont. View from the mountain to the southwest of it down the fish tail double red 
shale valley, split by the great mass of the Pocono rocks, is fine and instructive.

170 Carlisle. Trap dike 3 miles before reaching Carlisle ; visible a long way off as a low mound 
o=s the great valley covered with trees, while all around is cultivation. West of Carlisle notice 

igner&apos;s Gap&quot; and &quot;Doubling Gap&quot; in the North or B&apos;ue Mountain. They are really not gaps but 

*, caused by anticlinals passing through the mountain and elevating the vertical 5 a. Medina 
L. The mode in which this was done may be understood by holding up the edge of a sheet of 
in a perpendicular manner and then elevating it in one spot from beneath, which will cause 

upper edge to fold in an S shape, similar to these so-called gaps.

172. Upper Mill. Passes into the Papertown Gap of the South Mountains and turns to the right 
fS. W ), up the Mountain Creek Valley, with its range of old and extensive limonite mines, open 
quarries; ore heavily charged with manganese. Ride to the left (E.)over the divide, on which is Strick- 
ler&apos;s mine, and down to the Big bank. Very instructive. Over Strickler&apos;s, the mountain top is sad- 
dled with a 30-foot plate of Potsdam(?). In the Papertown gap beginning at the south end of Mt. 
Holly Springs Village are 3,000 feet (horizontal distance) of upturned quartzite rocks which belong 
perhaps to the Huronian system of Canada. These make the Mountain sandstone formation of 



Reports C and C2.

fully revised, and about fifty foot-notes appended by Professor Edward Orton, the present State 
Geologist. Several additional glacial notes are by Rev. G. Frederick Wright, of Oberlm, one of the 
United States Geologists, who has been engaged under Professor T. C. Chamberlain in making a special 
survey of the terminal moraine through Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. His notes are signed 
G. P. W., and all the other notes are by Professor Orton except No. 62. J. M. 

1. Newark. Glacial boundary at Newark. G. F. W. 

2. Chicago and Atlantic Railway. Route heavily covered with drift. 

3. Marion. Fine exposures of limestone in Marion quarries. Fossils abundant. 

4. Lima. Waterlime quarried here. Strong building-stone. Some beds fossiliferons. 

5. Winchester. Near margin of glacial drift. 

6. Mineral Springs. Springs derived from black shale. 

7. Miamisburg. Cedar trees and peat 100 feet beneath glacial deposits at Germantown, three 
miles southwest from Miamisburg. G. F. W. 

8. Amanda. Glacial boundary three miles east of Amanda. G. F. W. 

9. Lancaster. On the glacial boundary. Granite boulder two miles northeast, 18 x 11 x6 feet out 
of ground. G. F. W. 

10. Bremen. Glacial boundary two miles northwest. G. F. W. 

11. Cecil. Region heavily covered with drift. Very few outcrops of strata to be found. These 
mainly in beds of streams. 

12. Greenville. At Greenville an interesting outcrop of Guelph division of the Niagara occurs, 
rich in fossils. A number of new species have been obtained here. The rock is dolomitic, but con- 
tains more carbonate of magnesia than carbonate of lime.

35. Lakeside. Lake produced by glacial accumulations near margin of glacial area. 

36. Rushville. The upper beds of the Waverly here yield an abundant series of fossils, part of 
them agreeing with the Sub-Carboniferous limestone forms of Illinois. 

37. Moxahala. Between Moxahala and Corning the change occurs which converts the middle 
Kittanning coal seam (No. 6) from a 3$ foot seam into a 10-12 foot seam. The Mid. Kittanning coal, 
and also the Lower Freeport seam, are both mined at Moxahala. In the tunnel south of the town the 
Upper Freeport horizon is well shown except the coal. 

38. Corning. The Upper Freeport coal (No. 7) is also worked near Corning. It is known here as 
the &quot; upper vein,&quot; or Norns coal. 

39. North Bend. Extensive glacial deposits at North Bend railroad-tunnel, on the I. C.&amp;L. R. R., 
passes through a glacial deposit 150 feet deep. G. F. W. 

40. Springfield. Fine exposures of Niagara. Worked on large scale for building-stone and lime. 

41. Greenfield. Best showing of Lower Helderberg in Ohio. Stone of great value. Quarried on 
large scale for building-stone. All fragments and spalls burned for lime ; stone remarkably even bed-

near New Richmond, twenty-two miles by the river above Cincinnati, and extended across the north- 
ern counties of Kentucky, four or five miles south of the river, recrossing the Ohio near Aurora, Indi- 
ana. Mr. Wright inferred that one effect of this glacier was to form an immense dam of ice and mo- 
raine dfcbris, 500 to 600 feet high, which effectually closed the old channel of the Ohio for forty-nine 
miles by the windings of the river, and set back the water of the river and its tributaries until, as 
shown by Mr. I. C. White, it probably occupied the channel between the Eanawha and the Ohio Val- 
leys, through West Virginia, now the line of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. The site of Pitts- 
burg, Pa., was submerged to the depth of 300 feet, the remarkable terraces in the valleys of the Ohio. 
Allegheny, Monongahela,[and other branches, for the origin of which no satisfactory explanations had 
before been given, being then formed, according to White and Lesley, around the shores of this great 
inland lake. (See Note No. 62, in West Virgin ia.) J. M?

Sketch of the Geology of Michigan.* 

The State of Michigan is divided, geographically, into two parts by Lake Michigan and the Straits 
of Mackinaw, but geologically there is no such division, the upper and lower peninsula, as they are 
called, being, with the portion now covered by water, one uniform series of formations succeeding 
each other in their proper order. For the clear understanding of its geological structure we should 
imagine the water of the lakes removed, or the strata extending under it. The city of Cincinnati, 
in Ohio, stands upon a dome or ridge of upraised older strata which have been uncovered by the 
planing off of their higher beds, until on both sides of it the outcrop of several of the formations 
appear. The strata dip from this ridge towards the east and towards the west, and the line of it ex- 
tends towards the common corner of Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. It bifurcates, however, before 
reaching that point, the east branch running up to the west end of Lake Erie, causing several islands 
there, and subsides in Canada near the River Thames; while the west branch passes across the 
northern part of Indiana and Illinois to the head of Lake Michigan, and thence northwest through 
.-in. 

On the north another ridge of still older rocks, the 1. Laurentian, extends through Canada around 
the north shores of Lakes Huron and Superior. It also appears in the upper peninsula. This, the 
oldest of the formations, is the lowest and foundation of all, the later formations resting upon it, 
dipping south and southwest away from the Laurentian. The whole State of Michigan, including 
the parts covered by the lakes, is therefore surrounded on all sides by ancient axes of elevation, 
which, isolated her rock formations from the adjoining regions. It may be considered as one great 
basin, for even if the surrounding regions do not in all cases actually occupy a higher level, yet we 
find the strata dip from all sides towards the centre. The upper peninsula, or that portion of the 
State north of Lake Michigan, is bounded around the entire south shore of Lake Superior by the 
2 b. Potsdam red sandstone, of which the Pictured Rocks are composed, and reposing upon it are the 
south-dipping Lower Silurian series in regular belts, in a general east and west course, and extending 
up to 5 c. Niagara limestone, which extends between Green Bay and Lake Michigan, and forms the 
shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The Upper Helderberg also appears on Mackinaw and 
other islands. 

1. This chapter was prepared for this work by Prof. Alexander Winchell, LL. D., of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan, former Director of the Geological Survey of Michigan. 

2. The rocky formations of the lower peninsula are deeply and generally covered by drift. In 
all the western half of the State, south of Little Traverse Bay, no good characteristic exposures exist, 
save in Kent county and near Holland in Ottawa county. Hence in most cases our knowledge of the 
underlying rocks is only a matter of inference, A. W.

The lake is excavated chiefly in the 6. Salina formation, Prof. James Hall estimating that two- 
thirds of it is from that formation. The geological strata were first laid down extending across where 
the lakes now are, so that eastern Wisconsin is a part ot this basin. The lakes rest in troughs which 
have been excavated subsequently nearly along the strike or outcropping edges of some ol the 
softer formations. In the lower peninsula, or the main portion of the State between Lake Michigan 
and Lake Erie, all the Michigan series above the Niagara and up to the Carboniferous appear on the 
surface, but all of them much thinner than in the States farther east. 

To make it still more clear we might begin at the highest formation, the 14 b. Coal Measures, 
which extends, in an oval form ; trom Jackson to Saginaw Bay. This is the upper layer of rocks, ana 
the other formations crop out in successive layers below it on all sides. The annexed Railway Guide 
shows their exposures on the lines of the railroads, as they have been carefully made out by Prof. 
Alex. Wmchell. Each rocky stratum, therefore, may be considered as dish-shaped, and taken 
together they form a nest of dishes 01 basins, the highest being the coal field near the centre of the 
lower peninsula, and passing from this in any direction we travel successively over the outcropping 
edges of oldei and older strata. 

The Lake Superior iion oie is found in the 1 b. Huronian formation, directly west of Marquette. 
The copper is found chiefly in a great trap-dyke, which extends foi many miles along Keweenaw 
Point. These iron ore and copper producing mines are the richest and most productive in America. 

Michigan is therefore a distinct and independent geological area. Its topmost formation is a 
coal basin, underlaid by the Devonian formations, very much thinned out It is erue, and below that 
the Silurian largely developed and extending oat to the oldest Laurentian rocks on the north, and 
all this within the bounds of the State, with small portions only of this separate geological world ex- 
tending into adjoining States on the west side. The whole of the peninsula is covered with drift, 
from one hundred to three hundred feet deep, and rock exposures are very rate 

* Drift 164 feet on Main Street and 292 in Observatory Hill contains fossil wood at aep&apos;th of 60 feet,

* Four-fifths of the State of Indiana is covered with drift. It is 90 feet to the rock in Indianapolis. 
At some points north of Wabash River the drift has been bored into 4oo to GOO feet. It thins out as you 
BO toward Ohio River, does not reach it at some points, and is sparingly found south of that stream.

Glacial Notes by Rev. G. Frederick Wright. 

69. Cmrbondale. The Glacial boundry is between Carbondale and Mankanda. Fine Glacial striae 
are found 2% miles southwest of Carbondale and 5 miles southeast. 

70. Murphysboro. Glacial boundary about 5 miles south of Murphysboro turning thence to run 
parallel with the Mississipi to the neighborhood of St. Louis. 

71. Eldorado. The railroad crosses the southern boundary of the glaciated area at Eldorado 
and runs nearly parallel with it to Carnie. The boundary runs northeast by southwest. 

72. Sand Ridge. The western boundary of the glaciated area passes a mile or two west from 
Sand Ridge and runs northwest, following the course of the Misissippi River. 

73. Eldorado. The southeastern boundary of the glaciated loop of Illinois, passes through 
Eldorado, crossing the Wabash near New Harmony.

Brief Sketch of the Geology of Iowa. 

The general geologic structure of Iowa is simple: The prevailing dip of the strata is low, rarely 
reaching 5, and south-westerly in direction. In consequence the outcrops of the greater rock 
series, from the oldest to the newest, form successive zones trending N . W. S. E., each overlapped on 
the south-west by the attenuated margin of the next higher series. In detail this structure is modi- 
fied and complicated by slight diversity in strike and dip and variations in thickness of the several 
formations, and the regularity of the zones of outcrop is destroyed through erosion by which the 
north-easterly (and basal) margins of the successive formations are channelled, deeply crenulated, 
and sometimes cut off in insulated outliers; and some of the major as well as many of the minor 
features of the stratified rocks are obscured by a mantle of superficial deposits. 

The Potsdam is exposed by erosion only in the valley-bottoms of the extreme northeastern 
corner of the State, where it forms the gently-sloping bases of bluffs 300 to 500 feet high. The steeper 



medial portion ol tnese blutts is .Lower Magnesian limestone, which, by reason of its firm texture, 
ha* well resisted the degradation of the rivers and forms nearly continuous mural or castellated 
precipices. Both formations disappear on the Oneota (or Upper Iowa) river about the west line of 
Allamakee county, and on the Mississippi, a few miles south of McGregor. The gentle slopes toward 
the summits of the bluffs in this region represent the friable St. Peter sandstone, sometimes white 
as snow, again brown, red or yellow, and elsewhere curiously variegated, as at McGregor, where it 
forms the &quot;pictured rocks&quot; of Iowa. The generally abrupt escarpment of the Trenton limestone 
overlooks the easy slopes of the sandstone, and forms a secondary line of bluffs along the Mississippi, 
Oneota and Yellow rivers in the north, which merges into the immediate river bluffs toward the mouth 
of Turkey river. The Trenton is the first of the formations to occupy a considerable area. It extends 
along the Iowa-Minnesota line from a few miles west of the Mississippi to several miles west of De- 
corah; but by reason of rapid attenuation southward and its confinement to the precipitous Mississippi 
bluffs below the mouth of the Turkey, the terrane contracts greatly toward Dubuque, where it passes 
beneath the surface. Almost everywhere the Trenton is richly fossiliferous. The precipitous bluffs 
at Dubuque represent the Galena limestone, which there has a thickness of 200 or 250 feet, but which 
rapi-lly dwindles northwestward. It is the plumbiferous formation of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, 
and takes its name from the prevalent form of the ore. From its caverns are brought forth the 
superb stalactites and crystalline masses of various minerals adorning the lawns and verandas of 
Dubuque. A narrow belt of soft-contoured hills cleft by spring-born streamlets, or a single gentle 
slope, rises from the precipices of the Galena and Is overlooked by the bold Niagara escarpment. 
It represents the easily weathered shales and clays of the fossiliferous Maquoketa a fprmation 

Sjally exposed along the Little Maquoketa river in Dubuque county. The type section is at 
ttner&apos;s, on the D.&amp;N. W. R. R., and 4 miles north of Peosta, on the I. C. R. R. The most 
prominent topographic feature in the State is the deeply crenulated escarpment of the western 
equivalent of the New Yorfe Niagara, stretching from the Minnesota line north of Cresco by West 
Lnion, Elkport, &quot;sherrill&apos;s Mound&quot; (Dubuque county), Lattner&apos;s, and Peosta to the Mississippi at 
Bellevue.and forming the river-bluffs thence to Lyons. To the north the formation (generallj-a poorly 
fossiliferous dolomite abounding in cherty nodules) is thin, and its outcrop but a few miles in width ; 
but toward the south it thickens to 350 feet or more, and its terrane widens greatly. It forms the 
&apos; rapid- &quot; at Le Claire, but passes beneath the Mississippi between that town and Davenport. It is 
economically important by reason of its building-stone. Each of these formations (Niagara to Pots- 
dam) is clearly differentiated, and conjointly they constitute a topographically distinct seotion of the 
Stat^ a section in which the relief is the product of sculpture by ram and rivers during a vast period. 
Elsewhere the monotonous topography of the State is glacic in origin, with some post-glacial modifi- 
cation by hydric agencies: Here it is exclusively hydric. 

To the south westward the firm dolomites of the&quot; Niagara pass beneath the argillaceous limestones 
and shales of Devonian age which are usually referred conjunctively to the epoch of the New York 

1. By W. J. McGee, U. 8. Geologist. 

2. The Fort Dodge is referred to the Cretaceous with doubt.

lies 



Hamilton, the precise contact being everywhere concealed by drift save at Fayette and a point on 
the Wapsipinicon river a few miles above Central City, Linn county. The basal member of the 
Hamilton is a black shale which does not extend so far eastward as the medial calcareous member, 
but is exposed by excavations at Independence ; while the uppermost member, also a dark shale 
or clay (typically exposed at Rockford) rarely appears along the Drift-buried western margin of the 
terrane. The Sub-Carboniferous formations (Burlington, Keokuk, Kinderhook.and St. Louis) cannot 
be discriminated geographically by reason of their deep burial beneath Drift and Loess; but all have 
important local exposures ; the type sections of the first two being within the State. The Burling- 
ton is noted for its crinolds which have made famous alike the city from which the formation derives 
its name and their local investigator, Dr. Wachsmuth ; the Keokuk is equally noted for the magni- 
ficent geodes which have enriched so many collections; and both form the &quot;Lower Rapids&quot; which 
have so long vexed the spirits of Mississippi pilots and engineers. The Kinderhook yields a valua- 
ble oolitic limestone at Le Grand and elsewhere, and the St. Louis is still more important as a source 
of building material.

The southwestern third of the State is mainly occupied by the Coal Measures (generally divided 
into Upper, Middle, and Lower) which, notwithstanding their economic importance, hav not yet 
been adequately studied. It is known, however, that Coal Measure outliers, containing &quot; pockets &quot; of 
coal, and of such petrographic character as to indicate that they were deposited in bays or estuaries 
of the coal-period sea, repose unconformably upon the Sub-Carboniferous, the Devonian, and even the 
Silurian formation, far beyond the normal limits of the terrane; that workable beds of coal (under 
existing commercial conditions) are coafined in the lower member; and that the three members 
reach a total thickness of not less than 800 or 1,000 feet. The Carboniferous outliers find homologues 
in the Cretaceous sandstones designated Nishnabotna by Dr. White, after one of the rivers along 
which they occur; but only slight remnants of the formation they represent (unless it be the Ino 
ceramus, the Woodbury, or both) are preserved in Iowa. It is a good working hypothesis, but noth- 
ing more, that the bedded gypsum, 01 which the Ft. Dodge is composed, was precipitated in one of 
these Cretaceous estuaries so situated as to receive little drainage and suffer rapid desiccation after 
the first influx of the Mesozoic ocean. The Inoceramus (named from its characteristic fossil) and the 
Woodbury (named from the county in which it occurs, and well exposed about Sioux City) represent 
regularly bedded off-shore deposits not yet finally correlated with the well-developed Cretaceous 
deposits of Dakota and Nebraska. So far as certainly known they occupy a limited area in extreme 
western Iowa. 

Over the five-sixths of the State lying west and south of the Niagara escarpment the lithified 
sedimentary strata are over-spread by a sheet of Glacial Drift, which, in the northern-central and 
northwestern counties reaches a depth of 100 to 200 feet and effectually conceals the subterrane, but 
which attenuates eastward, southward, and westward to such a degree thai stream-corrasion and 
artificial excavation occasionally expose the subjacent rocks. In the northern part of the State 
Drift-bowlders frequently lie upon the surface ; and within an area of 4,000 or 5,000 square miles 
centering in Bremer county, these superficial bowlders of northern crystalline rocks reach maxima 
in dimensions and abundance. Diameters of fifteen to twenty feet are common ; and a dozen examples 
sometimes occur within a radius of half a mile. In eastern, and at least parts of central, Iowa the 
Drift is bipartite, and the &quot;Upper Till&quot; and &quot; Lower Till&quot; constituting it are frequently separated 
by a &quot;Forest Bed&quot;; and one of the loops of the great Kettle Moraine of northern United States 
extends far into the northwestern portion, reaching almost or quite to Des Moines; but tripartition 
of the Drift inside the loop has not yet been proven stratigraphicallv. Inside the moraine post- 
glacial drainage is not yet fully developed, lakes, ponds and sloughs abound, and the topography is 
the acme of monotony. In extreme southern Iowa the Upper Till disappears, and is replaced by a 
compact, tenacious, dark clay of aqueous origin, locally known as &quot; hard-pan ; &quot; and both ( as well as

the Lower Till when they are absent) are commonly overlain by Loess, which is generally uncon- 
formable to all older deposits, but in southern Iowa often merges by imperceptible gradations 
into the Upper Till. The Loess in the south and west is often attenuated or absent on divides and 
frequently eroded from valleys, and thus forms only the brows of the hills. The common phase of 
the Loess attains its best development along the Missouri River. In north-eastern Iowa, extending 
below the Niagara escarpment and overlapping the Drift margin for some miles, is another phase of 
the Loess, peculiar in its attitude; it sometimes descends into valleys, but generally seeks eminences, 
and caps the highest ridges and divides in the region. The rivers occasionally exhibit anomalous 
behavior in the same region, in that they have manifestly avoided and deserted lowlands and hava 
sought and corraded their channels in plateaus and in the axes of ridges. (See note 57.) Within the 
portion of the Wisconsin &quot; Driftless Region&quot; extending into Iowa, which is bounded by the Niagara 
escarpment, Glacial Drift is absent, and the prevailing superficial covering is a residuary clay formed 
through secular decomposition of the subjacent strata, together with a sheet of Loess and Drift 
debris. Alluvium occurs along all the streams of the State, and its amount varies with their volume.

26. Zwingle. Attenuated eastern margin of Glacial Drift. 

26. Washington Mill*. Maquoketa a few feet below level of creek. 

27. Bernard, Filmor*. Between these stations lies an insulated basin of Drift, completely sur-

28. Fort Dodge. St. Louis overlain by Fort Dodge resting on Lower Coal in hills. 

29. Almont. Maquoketa in slopes, Niagara in hills. 

30. Marshall. St. Louis? Lower Coal in eminences. Remarkable crinoid bed near here. 

31. Mo. Valley Junction. Glacial Drift in valleys. Loess on uplands. 

32. Maple River and Sac City Branches traverse an area over which the Glacial Drift is of consid- 
erable thickness and overlain by Loess, gradually thickening westward from an irregular eastern 
margin generally coinciding approximately with the Mississippi-Missouri watershed. 

33. WaU Lake is named from the adjacent lake, which is in part surrounded by a natural wall of 
rock, formed by the long continued pushing shoreward of the boulders lying upon its shallow bot- 
tom by the expansion of the ice in which they become bedded each winter. 

34. Dakota City. From near Dakota City to the Big Sioux River this railway traverses a heavily 
drift-mantled area, and the subterrane is wholly unknown empirically. The Sub-Carboniferous 
probably extends many miles. Northwest of Dakota there may be remnants of the Coal Measures. 
The Inoceramus and Woodbury are probably developed towards the state line where, too, the red 
quartzites of the Sioux doubtless lie beneath the Drift and Loess. 

35. Iowa City. Hamilton in city, and Lower Coal sandstones in hills to northward, overlain by 
Glacial Drift and Loess. Locality of &quot; Iowa City Marble.&quot; 

3 r&gt;. Oxford. Hamilton with Lower Coal sandstones in hills.

Carboniferous outliers (ferruginous sandstone, with pockets of coal) characteristic of eastern Iowa 
(cf. Hall, Geol. la., 1858. Pt. 1, 44, 120 et seq.) and into Hamilton strata which decline from perhaps 


100 feet above the river at Davenport to its level just below Muscatine. The stratified rocks are 
overlain by Drift, generally capped by Loess, which is typical in Muscatine.

57. Steamboat Rock. At and about this place the Iowa River flows in a gorge 50 to 150 feet deep, 
which it has eroded in friable ferruginous sandstone and firm limestones. To reach the plateau in 
which the gorge is excavated the nascent river left a low-lying valley in its direct course, goine 
some miles out of its way. This is one of the finest examples of the anamalous behavior of several 
Iowa rivers in avoiding valleys and seeking ridges and plateaus for their courses. ( cf. Burl. Phii 
Soc. Wash., VI, 1884, 93; Science II., 1883, 762; Trans. Iowa Hort. Soc. XVIIL, 1883, 528.)

Potsdam sandstone of the Wisconsin geologists; 3 c. of this scheme for Minnesota (the St. Croix

Winchell. Under the New York Calciferous are included the St. Peter sandstone, the Lower Magnesiau 
(Shakopee, Jordan and St. Lawrence), and the St. Croix sandstone. N. H. W. 

The course of glacial striae, and of transportation of the drift in eastern Minnesota, is southwest 
from Lake Superior to the Mississippi River; but in the west part of the State it is to the south and 
southeast, from Lake Winnipeg to Big Stone Lake, and into Iowa, excepting the southwest corner of 
the State, where the course iss^feflected to the southwest. 

A tract adjoining the Mississippi River, from Lake Pepin to the southeast corner of the State, lies 
in a driftless area, which has a large extent toward the east and south in Wisconsin. W. U. 

The four most notable features of the glacial drift in Minnesota are the following : 

a. Its great depth, averaging 100 feet, and sometimes exceeding 200 feet, upon the western two- 
thirds of the State, where it generally covers all the surface of the older bed rocks. W. U. 

6. The terminal moraines of the last glacial epoch. These belts of hilly and knolly drift reach 
from St. Paul and Minneapolis, north and northwest, to the Leaf hills and Itasca Lake. A great loop 
of the same formation also extends from Lake Minnetonka, by Albert Lea, into Iowa, to Pilot Mound, 
Mineral Ridge, and the vicinity of Des Moines, where it curves like the letter U, thence passing 
north west by Storm Lake and Spirit Lake in Iowa, and along the elevated Coteaudes Prairies through 
southwestern Minnesota into Dakota. W. U. 

c. Lake Agassiz, which occupied the basin of the Red River of the North and Lake Winnipeg 
during the recession of the ice sheet, that being a barrier to prevent the water on this area from 
flowing to Hudson Bay as now. The beach of Lake Agassiz is well exhibited on the Northern Pacific 
Railroad close east of Muskoda. W. U. 

d. The channel or valley in which lakes Traverse and Big Stone and the Minnesota River lie, 
excavated 100 to 225 feet in depth and about a mile in width. It was eroded by the outflow from Lake 
Agassiz; and the river thus formed has been named the River Warren, in honor of Gen&apos;l George K. 
Warren, who first described this channel and showed its origin from the glacial lake in the Red River 
Valley. W. U.

or four miles northwest of Eyota, on Chicago&amp;Northwestern Railroad. Two miles north Kasson build- 
ing stone of Galena formation (Upper Magnesian) are quarried of any size, 2 J^ inches thick. At 
Stockon and Lewiston, the lower Magnesian of similar dimensions are quarried by the Railroad Co., 
Same beds are wrought at Mankato somewhat thinner supply unlimited. Orthoceratidse, 10 inches in 
diameter. 8 or 10 inches long, have been found in lower Trenton about Rochester. W. D. HURLBTJT. 

Some persons prefer to call this the Upper Magnesian limestone. In going from Spring Valley 
east, we ascend over 183 feet of layers of this rock in four miles on the railroad. 

7. Worthinqton. The drift here is supposed to be 700 ft.elevation above tide; near town is over 1,800 ft. 

8. The Falls of St. Anthony, at Minneapolis, are caused by the rapid wearing out of the very 
friable St. Peter sandstone under the Trenton limestone, leaving a projecting shelf of the latter. 

9. Granite Falls is a reef or bar of quartette (probably metamorphic). It is expected that the 
most of our quartzites will prove to have been Potsdam. They appear in proper horizon as do those 
at Devils Lake, Wis., and Sioux Falls, Dakota. Boulders from these quartzite rocks are widely distrib- 
uted in Minnesota. W. D. H.

* The main line of the Northern Pacific Railroad is given in a separate chapter. 

10. The standard thickness of the formations in Minnesota of the palaeozoic rock i? : downward, 
Gal.-na, or Upper Magnesian, 183 feet; Upper Trenton, gray limestone, 120 feet; a green shale, 15 l.-et : 
Lower (blue) Trenton, 17 feet; St. Peter sandstone, 115 feet; Lower Magnesian. 25O feet; Potsdam, 
perhaps, 1,000 feet. The upper measures are greatly corroded and show but a small part of the sev.-nil 
measures, except the Lower Trenton and its invariable associate the St. Peter sandstone, giving 
such uniformity of escarpment as will be found in no other formations. The Upper Trenton is usually 
corroded well back from the front of any bluff and shows light slopes. W. D. H. 

11. From Tracy to Gary, on the southwest, are to be seen the foothills of the Coteau des Prairies. 
Going west from Tracy the railroad passes into a valley between two morainic hills, and near Canby 
the a-scent of the Coteau is begun, the summit of which is reached at Goodwin, Dak., at 1.996 feet 
above the sea. C. W. H. 

12. From Wadena to Fergus Falls the railway passes through the beautiful &quot; Lake Park Region,&quot; 
with the abrupt morainic mounds of the Leaf Hills and numerous glacial lakes. Near Ames and 
Everdill are the beaches of the glacial lake Agassiz (Upham.) C. W. H. 

13. Winnebago City is on the deposits of a glacial lake (&apos;Upham.) After crossing the Des Moines 
River the Coteau dee Prairies is ascended. The three highest points between the Des Moines and 
the James Rivers are : Four miles west of lona, 1,705 feet; four miles east of Pipestone City. 1,744 
feet; west of Lake Herman, Dak., 1,825 feet. At Pipestone City occur the beds of quartz ite and 
Catlinite (Indian Pipestone), of either Cambrian (Winchell), or Huronian (Chamberlin and Irving).

GENERAL NOTE ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE FAR WEST.

tfencrai got* an the (geologu 0f t\t SBfostera prt jrf ifj* 

fetent. 



It may he useful to those not familiar with the local geology of America, to insert a gen-ral 
account of the wcll-murked difference between the eastern and western parts of the Continent. 
Adopting the line of Central Texas, Indian Territory, Kansas, and Eastern Nebraska and Dakota, and 
-xt&gt;-uding it in the same general course to the Arctic Circle, we will have North America divided 
into two great divisions, in each of which the geology of the country has the same general character 
and each widely different from the other. 

The eastern division shows a sub-division into a number of great basins, representing all the 
older geological formations in their regular stratified order, and each with a carboniferous coal fit-Id 
on its summit, and then the whole area framed on the outside by two or three irregular bands of the 
Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary formations, and showing also several intermediate lines of 
Triasic and probably Jurassic. 

But on crossing the line above described, we pass from the old to the new geological world, in 
which the Upper Silurian* and Devonian formations are unknown, and even the Carboniferous appears 
in so changed an aspect as to be unworthy of the name, inasmuch as it is no longer coal bearing. 
As our geological table is now numbered, much more than half of it has here become useless in this 
western district, as none of those formations are there to be seen, and we come into a new geological 
continent of magnificent distances, covered for thousands of miles chiefly by the Cretaceous and 
Tertiary, with smaller areas of Triassic and Jurassic formations, with other vast areas of mountains 
and plains of eruptive and metamorphic rocks, with the minerals peculiar to them, affording but little 
material for geological notes, and sometimes greatly disturbing and subverting the order ot stratifica- 
tion and rendering Metamorphic the Cretaceous and Tertiary. Some of the ranges no doubt contain 
a central axis of granite and crystalline formations of the older rocks, and in time some small por- 
tions of the metamorphic rocks, like those of New England, may prove to have been changed from 
Palaeozoic and other formations well known in the eastern division. A few fossils here and there 
may show traces of what they once were, but as yet they may be classed under the comprehensive 
name of Metamorphic. 

But the most remarkable point in this description is the vast extent and great persistence and 
uniformity of these formations of the Far West, so limited in number and spreading from near the 
Mississippi and Missouri Rivers to the Pacific Ocean, and from the North Pole to the Isthmus of 
Tehuantepec. This statement gives a correct general impression of the geology of more than half of 
North America. An examination of this &quot;Geological Railway Guide,&quot; along all the lines as yet con- 
structed, and of all the geological maps of the United States and of the Dominion of Canada, and the 
reports of all travelers, will serve to confirm what has here been stated, and to impress on the mind 
of the student the important transition he makes in passing west of the Mississippi Valley. 

One of the most unfortunate facts in connection with the geology of this western district is, that 
throughout a large portion of it, especially its central and southern parts, the soil is &quot; alkaline,&quot; the 
rain-fall being less than the evaporation by which soluble salts are brought to the surface, rendering 
the land unfit for cultivation without irrigation, although portions of it afford pasturage, and there 
are many lakes and rivers whose waters contain a greater or less per centage of soda salts. The areas, 
however, are relatively small in which the soil is not able to yield crops, if only water can be sup- 
plied to it. 

Another point may be worthy of mention, namely, that the study of the formations of the Far 
West has only been begun, and they are so much more expanded and sub-divided that, for aught we 
now know, a new geological world may yet be opened, which may greatly enrich the science of 
geology, modifying our present series of the newer formations, giving us new views of structural and 
dynamic geology and discovering new forms of ancient life. 

It is as true now, as it was when written by Prof. James Hall, thirty years ago, that &quot;our knowl- 
edge of the geological formations of the West is so rapidly progressing, and the materials are accumu- 
lating in such abundance, that whatever may be presented to-day as new and in advance of previous 
knowledge, will to-morrow be regarded only as a historical record of our progress.&quot; J. M.

Winchell, of Minnesota, and that west of Bismarck, through Dakota and Montana, is by Prof. Raphael 
PumDellv whose work, however, was devoted almost wholly to coal explorations, and his journeya 
were made on horse trails, often off from the route of the railroad, before most of the stations in 
Montana and Idaho were located. His foot notes are marked R. P , those marked B T. P are by hi 
assistant, B. T. Putnam, and those signed G. W. D. are by Dr. George M. Dawson giving the observa- 
tions of a passing geological traveler well versed in the geology of the adjoining territory of Canada.

3. Near Blue Grass, detached portions of edge of plateau formed of Fort Union Laramie appear, 
rocks showing in some places. At Sims, same rocks.&lt;r. M. I). 

4. Sims (Ely&apos;s Mine). Several seams of lignite, of which two, 4 feet and 7 feet thick, are opened. 

R. P. 

5. Line runs on up Valley of Knife River, and gradually attains to level of plateau above referred 
to. Thi*, about Antelope and Richardson, forms a rolling and hilly prairie, which is based directly 
on Fort Tnion Laramie, the soil consisting of disintegrated rocks of this formation. No erratics or 
glacial drift appear anywhere on this plateau, so far as observed. G. M. D. 

6. At Gladstone, descend into Valley of Heart River continued exposures of Fort Union. 

G. M. D. 

7. From Belfield Station to the Little Missouri, pass through fine &quot; bad land &quot; scenery. Fine dis- 
play of rocks of Fort Union Laramie. Thin seams of lignite, which in many places have been burnt 
out, reddening the surrounding rocks. Large masses of silicified wood in some places. G. M. D. 

In entering the Bad Lands of the Little Missouri, the change in the scene is startling, and the 
-e of the badmae wholly novel and singularly grotesque. There are thousands of these 



-. and you ride in a fast train for an hour in the midst of red, gray, black, brown and blue towery, 

pyramids, peaks, rMtf *, &apos;I&apos;.rnes and castellated heights, turrets, battfements, sharp spires, grotesque 

les an&lt;i huge projecting buttresses an amazing jumble of weird architectural effects, that 



startle the eve vrith suggestions of intelligent design. It ia a region of extraordinary interest to the 
tourist and artist. E. V. SMAI.LEY. 

8. Scoria. In Bad lands or Pyramid Park. Near here are extensive burning seams of lignite. 

R P. 

9. Littl&quot; Missouri. Several seams of liernite. of which one, 7 feet thick is opened. R. P. 
At Little Jfittonri, high banks with good exposures of Fort Union Laramie rocks. 

10. Beyond Glendire, following the Valley of thf Yellowstone, numerous banks showing Fort 
Union, thin lignite seams and much massive soft sandstone. G. M. D.

11. Before reaching Howard, and between that station and Saunders, almost continuous exposures 
of massive yellowish soft sandstone, evidently Fox Hill, and nearly horizontal. G. M. D. 

12. In a cut at Meyer&apos;s, and just beyond that station, a slight undulation brings the top of the 
Pierre into view. The base of the sandstone becomes interbedded with dark shales. G. M. D. 

13. Similar sandstones, with top of Pierre occasionally showing below them, extend all along the 
Yellowstone Valley to Billing&apos;s, and beyond. At Billing&apos;s they form bold cliffs behind the town. The 
so-called Pompey&apos;s Pillar, near station of same name, is an isolated mass of these sandstones. G. M. D. 

14. Near Springdale, the rocks become disturbed for the first time, and dip at high angles. 
sic-Triassic, according to Hayden&apos;s map. (? ?) 

Beyond Springdale, fine views of Little Belt Mountains to north, and north end of Yellowstone 
range to south, the former composed (by map) of volcanic rocks, with a belt of Carboniferous tilted 
up around them, the latter of Metamorphic rocks, surrounded by Silurian, Carboniferous and Juras- 
sic-Triassic. G. M. D. 

15. Livingston. Branch railroad to Yellowstone National Park, Lower canon of the Yellowstone 
in sight. It is cut across the arch of a pitching anticlinal giving a fine section of Carboniferous, 
Jurassic, Triassic (?) and Cretaceous fossiliferous beds. R. P. 

10. From Livingston to Bozeman Tunnel. Cretaceous and possibly Jurassic-Triassic rocks, much 
disturbed, and at all angles to vertical. G. M. D. 

17. Hoppers. Seams of Cretaceous coking coal are worked a.mile or so south of the tunnel. R. P. 

18. At Timber Line, just west of Bozeman Tunnel, spur track to coal mine, which I am informed 
yields most of coal now used on line. G. M. D. 

19. Rock Canon, just beyond Timber Line, seems to show Carboniferous limestones and other 
old rocks nearly on edge. G. M. D. 

20. Chestnut. Several seams of coking coal, much crushed. Carboniferous, Jurassic and Da- 
kota exposed in a canon cut across the end of an anticlinal arch. R. P. 

21. Helena is built in a gulch, which has been washed with great profit for gold. R. P.

37. At Dolls, basaltic lava in numerous supposed flows forms the hills. 

38. At Cascades, tufaceous and agglomerate beds appear, and beds of rounded gravels underlie 
the volcanic materials. Basalts of hills in light, broad undulations. G. M. D. 

39 The Volcanic Region The portion of the Northern Pacific Railroad through the vast volcanic 
region in Washington and Oregon, affords but little material for interesting geological notes. A recent 
report of Mr. J. C. Russel, in the 4th Annual Report of the U. S. Geolog&apos;l Survey, gives some descriptions 
of the little known part of Southern Oregon, south of the railroad. Its rocks are almost wholly vol- 
canic, and spread out in great sheets of lava that once formed a broad, smooth table-land ; but in later 
times it has been broken by faults, so characteristic of the Great Basin region, and thus divided into 



tossed about like the cakes of ice in a crowded floe, their upturned edges forming bold palisades that 
render the region almost impassable, which, with the branching fault cracks, combine to make a re- 
gion of the wildest and roughest description. At present the waters have retreated from the terraces 
and benches that marked their former level, some, like Summer and Albert Lakes, are permanent 
sheets of very saline water, but the more numerous are fresh. Mr. Russel finds no evidence of either 
local or general glaciation in the region he examined. The volcanic history of Oregon and Washing- 
ton is far from being understood. The points that may be claimed as centres of eruption are rare, so 
far as has yet been observed, and in only a few instances can the overflows of lava be traced to their 
sources. Captain C. E. Button reports immense flows of lava in the Sandwich Islands, from surpris- 
ingly small openings. But those were down the sides of a steep mountain. Neither is there definite 
and satisfactory evidence obtained that these immense lava fields originated from fissure eruptions. 
With the exception of very recent deposits of lacustrine origin, nothing is to be seen but volcanic 
rocks in sections or regularly stratified layers, which from a distance resemble sedimentary beds, 
but on examination one finds them to be wholly of igneous origin. These black volcanic rocks are 
composed of rhyolite, together with large quantities of obsidian or volcanic glass. No evidence of 
volcanic craters were observed, and no basaltic overflows were seen to indicate centres of recent vol- 
canic action. Major Powell reports this region as containing the grandest and most extensive dis- 
play of volcanic phenomena now known in any part of the world, and the investigation of it promises 
to supply matter of great importance and instruction to geologic science. We do not yet know even

the extent of this vast volcanic region in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and California, but it 
has been estimated by Prof. Joseph LeConte, at from 200,000 to 300,000 square miles, and its age, he 
thinks, is Tertiary aud probably Miocene. After these vast fields of lava had cooled and consolidated, 
then came another revolution that affected a region equally great, but situated mostly to the south of 
it, a force or series of forces, the power and extent of which are utterly beyond the limits of our con- 
ception, which broke the earth&apos;s crust into thousands of fragments, which were depressed and buried 
or upheaved into mountain ridges. It will be, when fully explored, one of the wonders of geolopy 
for its extent, its remarkable structure, and the mystery of its origin.

They differ slightly from those in Gannett&apos;s Dictionary of Altitudes, in Minnesota, but agree with 
them in Montana, and all west of that The original datum point was obtained by taking the assumed 
low water of Lake Superior at 602, as determined bf Captain Bayfield, of the Royal Navy, in 1825, by 
larometrical observations, which have been confirmed by the United States Engineers. From the 
west, the datum is mean low water of Puget Sound- J. M.

1. The large number of railroads constructed in the &quot; North West&quot; since the preparation of 
the chapter on the Northern Pacific, has necessitated the addition, out of the proper order, of some 
lines properly belonging in that chapter. Other new lines are also added. 

2. By Mr. Warren Upham, Assistant Geologist U. S. Geological Survey. 

3. Kintyrt. See note 14, N. A S. Dakota. 

4. See note 13, N. A S. Dakota. 

5. The formations are older than the Cretaceous, including probably Jurassic or Triassic and 
Carboniferous. 

6. The remainder of the chapter is by Mr. Bailey Willis, Assistant U. S. Geologist. The 
elevations, so far as given, are furnished by Mr. Henry Gannett, Chief Geographer, U. S. Survey. 
Much of the region traversed by these railroads has not been carefully surveyed, and the assign- 
ments of formations and the notes are necessarily of a general character. See note 39 Northern 
Pacific R. R. 

7. Twenty miles west of Pasco, the road leaves the volcanic flows of the Great Plain of the 
Columbia and enters Yakima Prairie. Thence to ten miles beyond Ellenburg the route is through 
Ahtanam, Wenass, and Kittittass Prairies and through the canons of the Yakima, which separate 
the valleys ; the Prairies are Tertiary (?) lake beds, drained through the canons which the river 
has cut in volcanic rocks, also Tertiary. 

B. W. 

8. Branch from Clealum to Rosyln coal mine. Coals of Puget group, (Upper Cretaceous.) 

9. The road runs across the main range of the Cascades, which consists of granite. 
Palaeozoic crystallines and Cretaceous strata, folded and afterwards cut through and overflowed 
by Tertiary eruptive*. The Cretaceous rocks are sandstone and shale, resting on a basal con- 
glomerate. The volcanic rocks preponderate in this section, but give way to granite north- 
ward beyond Snoqualmie. B. W. 

10. The pass is 3,980: the tunnel 2,885 above tide.

11. Drift Plain, with occasional outcrops of Tertiary eruptives and river canons cut down 
into Upper Cretaceous (Puget Group) coal measures. B. W. 

12. This road is probably all on drift (glacial) with occasional outcrops of sandstones of 
Puget group, coal measures. B. W. 

13. The line lies chiefly through regions of volcanic flows, and the conditions were favor- 
able for the formation of lake deposits during both Tertiary and Quarternary time. It is 
probable, though not known to be true, that the agricultural lands of this region are very largely 
dried lake beds. Specific information as to localities is not at present obtainable. The same 
statement is also applicable to the other line of the O. R.&amp;N. Co., east of Umatilla. 

B. W. 

14. The following note is on the branch of the Northern Pacific to Carbonado. (See page 263). 
At South Prairie, Wiikeson, and Carbonado, bituminous coking coal is mined. This is the only 
producing field of coking coal on the coast; the Strata are Upper Cretaceous, &quot; Puget Group.&quot; 
Similar trip south of Alaska. B. W. 

Wiikeson is the starting point for parties visiting the glaciers of Mt. Tacoma, distance 25 
miles over a good horse trail ; time required for trip, including ascent over snow fields to 
9,500 feet above sea, in three days ; the route is through the great forests of the region in 
their most typical development, and the glacial phenomena are of more striking interest and 
beauty than those afforded by any. 

Some suggestions as to geology on the Oregon and Washington Railway, in Washington, 
may be gathered by the traveler from the foregoing notes. Nothing more definite can be 
obtained. J. R. M. 

The&apos; following altitudes, taken from Mr. Gannett&apos;s Dictionary of Altitudes, are of interest. 
Mt. Baker, 10,827 feet; Mt. Hood, 11,225; Mt. Jefferson, 15,500; Mt. Olympus, 8,138; Ranier,

2. On W., St. L. A P. R. R., in Warren and Montgomery Counties, we pass within a few miles 
irom Carboniferous, chiefly Lower part of Sub-Carboniferous through thin outliers of Devonian to 
the Receptaculite (Galena Limestone) and Trenton and Black River to the 1st Magnesian limestone 
and Saccharoidal sandstone; the latter well developed and very suitable for glass-making purposes- 
thick deposits and easy to crush. It is the equivalent of the St. Peter&apos;s sandstone.

4. On Missouri Pacific R. R., from St. Louis west, we pass St. Louis group, Lower Coal Measures, 
St. Louis group Warsaw limestone, Burlington and Ghouteau group to the Trenton, but no Devonian. 
At Hermann we have 2d Magnesian limestone capped in hills back with 1st or Saccharoidal sandstone, 
and at Jefferson we have 2d Magnesian limestone rising in a few miles south exposing in succession 
2d sandstone and 3d Magnesian limestone. West of Tipton the same limestone (2d) is capped by 
Burlington limestone. The latter west of Sedalia having reposing on it the sandstone at top of Sub- 
Carboniferous (Millstone Grit?) and underlaid by Chouteau group. Then the Coal Measures appear. 

6. At Cheltenham, four miles from St. Louis, are vast deposits of good fire clay.

6. Down the St. Louis A Iron Mountain R. R. we have St. Louis limestone then Warsaw limestone. 
Keokuk limestone and Burlington limestone within 20 miles. Crossing the Merrimac River, we find 
the last for while, then the Receptaculite, Trenton and Black River limestone, 1st Magnesian 
limestone, and at Horine Station the Saccharoidal sandstone, very soft, used for glass-making, and is 
Tery white and pure. Afterwards we have 2d Magnesian limestone. Crossing Big River, the 3d 
Magnr-sian limestone near Iron Mountain. De Lassus, Mine la Motte, Fredericktown, Pilot Knob, 
Des Arc and Annapolis are porphyry hills of Huronian age, and the adjacent limestones and lower 
sandstones and conglomerates are probably Potsdam. At Mine la Motte and Fredericktown are 
certainly Potsdam fossils, but the absolute line (if any) has not been determined between the 
Potsdam and Calciferous beds. Near Iron Mountain, Knob Lick and Cornwall are superior granite 
quarries, which may be of age of Laurentian. 

7. Four miles southeast is Crystal City on the Mississippi Rivr, where glass is made. The 
Saccharoidal or St. Peter&apos;s sandstone is here forty or fifty feet thick, and over one hundred feet 
thick in Warren County. It is very valuable for glass-making. 

8. Iron Mountain is 223 feet high, and its base covers 500 acres. 

9. Pilot Knob is a conical hill, nearly circular, 581 feet high, with a north and south diameter 
of about one mile at its bane, which covers 360 acres. Elevation 1,500 feet above sea.

the 2d Magnesian limestone gradually rises, showing some 2d sandstone, and through Crawford, 
Phelps, andl Pulaski counties the latter is the highest rock, resting on 3d Magnesian limestone, the 
latter well exposed along the Gasconade River. Crossing it, we are upon the highest lands in 
Missouri. Descending towards Springfield, we find the Lower members of the Sub-Carboniferous

County we find a coarse ferruginous sandstone, probably equivalent to Millstone Grit, but more 
probably a member of the Chester group, resting on Lower Carboniferous limestone. Throughout 
Newton and Jasper, the Sub-Carboniferous limestone, with much chert is of great development, 
and ia galeniferous. The celebrated lead mines of Joplin and Granby occur in this.

1. By Mr. Orestes St. John of Topeka, Kansas. 

2. Leavenworth. In the vicinity of Leavenworth and at the State Penitentiary at Lansing, a 21- 
inch seam of coal is mined by means of shafts at a depth of between 700 and 800 feet. The limestones 
crossing the bluffs that hem the Missouri are richly stored with characteristic upper coal measure 
fossils. The Loess heavily covers the bluffs, and in the bed of the Missouri Valley the glacial drift 
occurs beneath the alluvial deposits. Deposits of modified drift or stratified gravels locally 
intervene between the Loess and the basis rocks of the region. 

3. Topeka. The Osage coal crops in the western suburbs of the city, where it is mined to 
limited extent. An experimental diamond drill boring, authorized by the local government, has 
penetrated the coal measure series to the depth of between 1,600 and 1,700 feet at this writing, 
encountering several thin deposits of coal.

8. Junction City. Extensive quarries in heavy ledges of light buff limestone, used in the con- 
struction of the east wing of the Capital at Topeka. 

9. Solomon. Strong brine wells in gypsiferous shales of the Permo-carboniferous, from which 
salt has been manufactured quite extensively. 

10. Bavaria. The Dakota sandstone near this place affords numerous characteristic fossils. 
Near Brookville Dicotyledonous leaves abundant in the sandstone. 

11. Pittsburgh. Centre extensive coal mining interests and zinc smelting furnaces. The ores 
are brought from Galena and adjacent mining districts in Missouri, in the lower carboniferous 
rocks. 

12. Weir City. Centre of coal mining district, zinc smelting establishments. 

13. Galena. Extensive lead and zinc mines in lower carboniferous Keokuk formation. 

14. Otwego. The Neosho river is excavated into the lower coal measures, the upper coal hori- 
zons of wnich appear at various localities in the vicinity. The plateau upon which the town is 
located, is formed by the basal limestones of the upper coal measures, including the horizon of the 
Ft. Sf-ott coal, which is here a bituminous shale and the cement rock. Interesting localities for 
both upper and lower coal measures fossils. 

15. Neodesha. Along the Verdigris and Elk rivers a heavy ledge of sandstone occurs, 
which belongs well up in the upper coal series, and affords remains of large trees peculiar to the coal 
measures period. Although the Verdigris has cut its bed more deeply, geologically it is more 
than a thousand feet above the Neosho at Oswego, or on the line of greatest depression between the 
Ozark region of 8. W. Missouri and the first great highland belt traversing Central Kansas from 
near the south border to the Nebraska line on the north.

16. Beaumont. Summit of the &quot; Flint Hills,&quot; composed of a cherty member and the light buff 
limestones of the Permo-Carboniferous, forming a highland bench of the type of a monocline, pre- 
senting a somewhat abrupt eastern scarp and lonjg gentle westerly slope. A conspicuous topographic 
feature at intervals across the central portion of the State to the Nebraska line. 

17. Wichita lies within the area occupied by the heavy series of shaly deposits, to which the 
great salines and salt beds, occurring in central Kansas, belong. These deposits underlie the &quot;red 
beds &quot; presumably of Triassic age, and are in conformable sequence with the underlying porous 
limestones and shales of the so-called Permo-Carboniferous. 

18. Winfidd. Extensive quarries of even, thick, and thin-bedded limestone, affording fine 
building material and flagging in the vicinity. 

19. Scott City. Basin receives considerable drainage from the west. 

20. The line from La Cross follows the water-shed south of the Smoky Hill, an elevated plain 
steadily increasing in altitude to nearly 4,000 feet on the west boundary of the State, and blanketed 
by Tertiary deposits. The Niobrara appears along the more deeplv eroded drainage channels 
flowing to the Smoky Hill, the exposures affording characteristic fossils. 

21. Louisburg. Natural gas wells, also near Somerset. 

22. The highlands west of Mankato are blanketed by Tertiary deposits, the Cretaceous, 
Niobrara, appearing at intervals in the more deeply cut drainage channels. The latter deposits 
abound in characteristic fossils, vertebrates and mollusks. 

23. Paola. Natural gas found in drilled wells in vicinity, in considerable volume. 

24. La Cygne. Coal shaft, to workable vein in lower portion of Upper Coal measures. 

25. Pleasanton. Coal shaft, same coal mined at La Cygne. On mine creek, S. E. of the town, 
the ores of lead and zinc occur in Upper Coal measures strata. Near the town a bituminous sand- 
stone affords flagging layers. 

26. Ft. Scott. Gas and mineral water developed in drilled wells. Associated with a thin coal 
which has been extensively worked by surface stripping in the vicinity and south to Arcadia and 
Mulberry, occurs an hydraulic limestone, which furnishes material for the manufacture of cement, 
which is extensively engaged in at Ft. Scott. 

27. Farlington. In the vicinity, extensive quarries have been opened in a flagging sandstone.

thousand&gt;composed of igneous rocks, granite, sienite, diorite, basalt, etc. On the higher mountains 
excellent pine timber grows; on the lower, cedars and sometimes oak ; in the valleys of the Rio 
Grande, mezquite. The general dryness of the climate and the aridity of the soil will always confine 
agriculture to the valleys, by well-managed systems of irrigation ; but water courses which contain 
running water throughout the year are very rare. There are, however, large tracts of land, too 
distant from water or too mountainous to be cultivated, which afford excellent pasture for millions 
of stock during the whole year, as horses, mules, cattle, sheep and goats, and no feeding in stables 
in the winter is necessary. 

41. Albuquerque. On the east are rugged granite mountains. The country about the place is 
well cultivated by means of irrigation. It is astonishing how soon this apparently sterile soil is 
changed into the more fertile by affluence of water. 

42. Atlantic and Pacific Junction. For the sake of continuity, the railroad from this point by the 
Needles to Mojave, is given in the chapter on California. 

43. Belen. Mountain bluffs reach the Rio del Norte, and consist of black amygdaloidal basalt. 

44. Sabinal. This book is strictly a geological work and not botanical, but it is well to note the 
beginning here in going south of two of the prevailing plants. The so-called mezquite, now first 
makes its appearance. It is thorny like a locust, bears yellow flowers and long pods, with a pleasant 
sour taste, and the wood is compact and heavy. The mezquite is the most common tree on the high 
plains of Mexico, and the pest of the country for travelers and forms the endless chaparral. 
Here it is but five or ten feet high, but in Mexico it is some times forty or fifty feet. 

The other new plant is the yucca, resembling the palm tree with very fibrous, straight, pointed 
leaves. It is often the only tree growth visible in the desert, with its awkward branches terminated 
by tufts of its rigid lance-shaped leaves imparting a weird aspect to the landscape. It bears a cluster 
01 white, bell-shaped, numerous flowers hanging down from their weight, one to two feet in length.

Near Santa Fe it is from two to three feet high, but the larger species in Northern Mexico grow as 
trees of several feet in diameter and forty or fifty feet in height. W. 

Meaquit or Prosopis glandulosa of Gray and Torrey, is a shrub or tree with thorny branches and 
desiduous foliage, which is composed of thin and scattered leaflets, affording no protection from 
the heat. Its flowers are greenish Thite at first, and later yellow. The ripe pods are yellowish 
white, mottled with red, and the ripe beans are used for food by the Mexicans, and are eaten by 
animals. As fuel, the wood, both root and stem, is unsurpassed. The roots often afford much fuel 
when there is hardly any stalk, branches, or foliage. Of roots there are two kinds, some of them 
spreading laterally, while others are very long top roots. Large mesquite trees indicate the pres- 
ence of water beneath. The mesquit flourishes in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico, its 
northern limit being the 37th parallel or the southern boundary of Colorado and Utah.

46. Socorro. The mountains consist principally of porphyritic rocks, with green trachyte. 

At Lopez, six miles beyond Socorro, the mountains which have generally been ten to twenty 
miles distant now approach, and the bluffs consist of brown, nodular sandstone ; south of this the 
hills are black basalt. 

46. Rincon. The Jornada del Muerto, literally the day&apos;s journey of the dead man, which refers 
to an old tradition that the first traveler who attempted to cross it in one day perished on the way, 
was a part of the old Santa Fe road, 90 miles in length without any water in the dry season. The 
circuitous course of the river, with rough mountains along side of it, rendered it necessary to resort 
to this awful Jornada. As to the Colorado Desert, see in the California chapter notes Nos. 24, 25, 29, 
80 and 31. 

47. Montoya, Organ Mountain. The eastern mountain chain has a very broken pointed 
basaltic appearance, and is called the Organ Mountain, from the resemblance of the basaltic 
columns of its terminus to the pipes of that instrument. 

48. El Pato. Note 13 on Texas. 

TH DESIRT FORMATION. To the traveler from the East, the desert country of the West and 
Southwest is surprising. The valley of the Mississippi, so called, lying between the Appalachian 
chain and the desert oorder of the Rocky Mountains, consists of each an expanse of fertile 
country, as can be found in one body, nowhere else on the face of the globe, producing all the 
fruits of the earth, including those found in every zone from the boreal regions to the tropics. 
The region west of the Mississippi Valley, and extending to the Coast Range of California on the 
contrary, is widely different, owing to the dryness of the climate and the presence of &quot;alkalies&quot; 
injurious to vegetation in extensive districts, and the physical structure of the surface formations 
often consisting of stratified pebbles and coarse sandy layers of great thickness. In these deep 
porus layers, rapidly absorbing the rain-fall, which is very small, leaving the surface an arid waste 
under a burning sun we see one important cause, in many places, of the desert character of this 
region, covering a vast extent of the great Southwest. Except on the borders of streams scarcely 
anything exists deserving the name of vegetation, in the absence of irrigation. But there seems to 
be hope for most of these deserts, as in other arid localities population and the cultivation of the 
soil increases the amount of rain-fall, while irrigation from the streams and artesian wells develop 
wonderful fertility from the soils of deserts.

GENERAL NOTES ON THE GEOLOGY OF NEBRASKA. 

1. A large number of the localities have been personally visited. For lines not traversed, 
careful consideration of published statements by Hayden, Meek, Aughey, and others, has been 
employed. 

2. The quaternary deposits may be grouped, in the order of formation, as follows: (a) Till or 
typical Boulder Clay, with numerous striated pebbles and boulders from the north. It is usually 
yellow or blue and &quot;jointed.&quot; (b) Red Clay, showing commonly a red color and always more or less 
ptratified but otherwise resembling till, into which it passes below. It sometimes shows few, if any 
aebbles in its upper portion, (c) Loess, a homogeneous straticulatc silt usually dull yellow or drab 
siid commonly containing calcareous concretions, always cracked within, (d) A Red Loam, contain 
ing sometimes white, water-worn quartz pebbles. This deposit is found beyond the western limits of 
the till and red clay, underneath the Loess. It is frequently capped, as is also the Red Clay at some 
points, with a dark chocolate-colored earth, two to four feet thick, commonly called &quot; the old soil.&quot; 
Beds of gravel and sand occur irregularly in all quaternary deposits, except, perhaps, the Loess. In 
Knox county it is the prevailing drift deposit. The term drift is here used to indicate any deposit 
containing northern erratics referable to glacial origin. 

A volcanic ash stratum, evidently deposited in Quaternary times, is widely deposited in Knox, 
Cum ing, Lancaster, Seward, and Furnas counties, and along the Republican further west. 

3. The Tertiary Deposits are not satisfactorily determined, especially in portions of the State 
most traversed by railroads. Hayden, Aughey, and others agree that the later Miocene.White River 
Group, and the Pliocene, Loup Fork Group, are both represented. But as they are conformable, 
quite variable in composition, imperfectly exposed, and fossils are rare, they are easily confounded. 
Hence the formations given in the table are largely provisional. 

4. Another question in several cases is whether certain beds are Quaternary or Tertiary. 
Certain beds of sUt or &quot; silicious marl &quot; do not clearly show whether they were deposited in Lake 
Cheyenne of the Pliocene age or in Lake Missouri, as we may call its successor or continuation in 
Quaternary times.

GEOLOGY OF COLORADO. 

Certain broad general features of the geology of Colorado are comparatively simple and, owing 
to the climatic conditions of the region which leave the rock exposures relatively unobscured, 
can be easily recognized by the geological tourist. The details of structure for any particular 
region are, on the other hand, as a rule extremely complicated and have only been worked out 
over limited areas. Even were they fully known it would not be practicable to explain them 
in the restricted space of the present guide. The notes given above, therefore, must be un- 
derstood as only indicating these broad and easily recognizable features. In some few cases, 
moreover, ,the country has not been visited since the respective railroads have been built, 
and in such cases the geological indications given may not be strictly applicable to the 
actual location of the given railroad station ; in other cases there may still be some doubt 
as to the exact subdivision of a geological formation which is exposed at a given point. It 
is believed, however, that such cases are sufficiently explained by the accompanying notes 
to avoid leading the observer into any serious error. The Hayden atlas of Colorado gives a 
most excellent idea of the general distribution of geological formations throughout the state 
whenever these notes differ therefrom it is because later and more detailed studies have 
enabled the writer to make such later corrections, as would naturally be called for in a work 
of so general a character as that necessarily was. 

GCNCRAL STRUCTURE. 

In physical structure this region may be divided into a mountain area and plain 
areas which border it both on the east and west sides. The plain area? and 
many of the broad valleys, included within the mountain area proper, show as a rule only 
exposures of Mesozoic, generally Cretaceous, strata, or of overlying Tertiary beds, either of

the other hand are found the original Archaean rocks, which form the base of all the deposits, and 
some considerable areas of upturned Palaeozoic beds, and of eruptive rocks. Along the im- 
mediate flanks of the mountains, especially on the east flank of the Colorado or Front 
Range, the upturned Mesozoic strata often form fringing reefs, popularly called &quot;Hogback&quot; 
ridges, approximately parallel with the shore line of the sea in which they were originally 
deposited. Large areas of Archaean rocks have undoubtedly never been entirely submerged 
since Archsean times, and everywhere, where erosion has gone deep enough, they are exposed 
as the base rock. 

Wnile the view of earlier geologists that the time of principal uplift in this region was 
at the close of the Cretaceous still nolds good, evidence has recently been found in local 
nonconformities, of subsidence and elevation both previous and subsequent to this period. 

ARCH/CAN FORMATIONS. 

These consist of granite, granite-gneiss, micaceous and hornblendic gneisses and 
amphibolites. The granite is sometimes found as an immense central mass upon which 
the more distinctly stratified members of the formation are apparently resting ; again 
as distinctly eruptive or intrusive masses penetrating these members, and still again as 
a constituent part of them, sharing in their bedded structure. Granite has never yet been 
found in Colorado penetrating later formations than the Archaean, although some 
later eruptives have so crystalline a structure that they might on hasty examin- 
ation be considered to be granite. Granite-gneiss is the name given to a very 
common development among these rocks in which, while the component miner- 
als are foliated, the rocks nave still the massive structure of granite. The true gneis- 
ses vary from the extreme micaceous to the extreme hornblendic type, and the amphibolites 
are massive rocks composed almost exclusively of hornblende. Less crystalline rocks than 
the above, if present, are very rare, and as yet no limestones whatever have been found 
among these rocks. For one who wishes to make a study of this oldest known geological 
formation, which presumably represents the first rock crust of the globe, no better field can 
be found than is afforded by the many deep canon exposures of Colorado. 

PAUEOZOIC FORMATIONS. 

These are much thinner in Colorado than in Nevada or in the Eastern states. The 
Cambrian which is the lowest formation found in contact with the Archaean consists of a few 
hundred feet of saccharodial quartzites, generally white, and passing up into shaly and more 
or less calcareous beds carrying fossils of the Upper Cambrian. A still lower unconform- 
able series of beds, about ten thousand feet in thickness and later than the Archaean, has 
been observed by the writer at a single locality in the state but not on the line of any rail- 
road. Above the Cambrian are a few hundred feet of light colored siliceous limestones, of- 
ten magnesian, sometimes greenish or pinkish in color, whose fauna corresponds to that ot the 
Pogonip, or Silurian limestone of Nevada. 

The Devonian is apparently wanting in Colorado, as the beds found immediately overly- 
ing the above, generally a blue gray limestone or dolomite, carry lower Carboniferous fos- 
sils. There is some evidence of a nonconformity by erosion in the upper part of 
the Silurian which would explain the local absence of Devonian formations. The Carboniferous for- 
mation has a greater aggregate thickness than all the other Palaeozoic formations combined. 
The lower Blue limestone (above mentioned is generally succeeded by black shales and these 
by a very considerable thickness, amounting to two or three thousand feet, of sandstones 
and conglomerates with subordinate beds of black shale and limestone, locally known as 
the Weber Grits. Thin beds of impure anthracite are sometimes found in the lower part of 
this formation. Its prevailing colors are gray or red. The upper part of the Carbon- 
iferous formation is of similar constitution, generally with an increasing proportion of calcar- 
eous beds and of coarse red sandstones, which are often difficult to distinguish from the imme- 
diately overlying red sandstones of the Trias. Gypsum is found in these upper beds. No 
unquestionably Permian fauna has yet been found in Colorado. 

MESOZOIC FORMATIONS. 

The Trias is represented by a series of coarse red sandstones and conglomerates, the form- 
er often strikingly crossbedded, which are everywhere prominent by their brilliant coloring. 
Organic remains are apparently almost, entirely wanting in these beds, for whish reason it is 
impossible to draw a definite dividing line between this and the preceeding or succeeding forma- 
tion. 

The Jura consists of a gray or buff sandstone at base, often crossbedded, succeeded by 
shales of variegated colors, with lenticular secretions of limestone which sometimes form a 
distinct and prominent bed. This formation is locally well defined by both molluscan and 
vertebrate remains. 

The Cretaceous is the most important of the Mesozoic formations and is subdivided into four 
members. The Dakota at the base is characteristically a heavy bedded sandstone or quartz- 
ite, carrying a peculiar conglomerate bed at its base. The formation also includes some beds 
of shale, and on the eastern slopes of the mountains carries beds of remarkable pure fire 
clay. The Colorado next above is essentially a clay formation, its clays being black when 
freshly opened and bleaching upon exposure; its topography hence is quite characteristic. 
It generally carries a bed of light colored limestone, which is known as the Niobrara lime- 
stone, being characteristic of the sub-division of that name formerly made by Dr. Hayden. 
The Fox Hills and Laramie sub-divisions which succeed consist of alternating friable sandstones and 
clays, and are only distinguishable from each other by their molluscan remains, which in 
the former are marine, in the latter brackish, or fresh water. The Laramie formation has 
been formerly considered Tertiary by some geologists on account of its fauna, but later in- 
vestigations have shown it to be more properly the closing member of the Cretaceous from a 
paleontological point of view, while its stratigraphical relations have always associated it with 
the Cretaceous. It is the coal-bearing formation of the West, most all the known coal deposits 
whose horizon has been accurately determined having been found to belong to it, while of 
those not yet thoroughly studied some have been provisorily assigned to the Fox Hills. 



COLORADO. 299 



TERTIARY FORMATIONS. 

There are many detached remnants of fresh water Tertiary formations in Colorado, the 
relations of which to each other have not yet been thoroughly worked out, nor in most 
cases have their ages been satisfactorily determined. In the above notes therefore they have 
not been assigned to any definite subdivision, and the local names are given only when they 
are sufficiently known to justify it 

QUATERNARY FORMATIONS. 

These have likewise not been subdivided, though it is evident that there were several 
distinct periods of deposit. They have been indicated in the notes only where they so ob- 
scure the underlying formations that the latter can be determined either not at all or only 
with considerable uncertainty. 

ERUPTIVE ROCKS. 

These form a most important feature in the geology of Colorado. In the Archaean rocks 
they occur as narrow dikes of porphyry, diorite and diabase. In the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic forma- 
tions are laccolitio masses and immense intru.sive sheets of prophyry, porphyrite and diorite whose 
principal time of eruption was just preceding and subsequent to the Post Cretaceous upheav- 
al. Among later Tertiary and recent eruptive rocks are found hornblende and hypersthene an- 
desites, basalts, rhyolites and less frequently trachytes. The larger areas of recent surface 
flows are found in the southwestern part of the State. Here are extensive bedded masses 
of breccia, formerly considered trachytic but probably in large part, if not entirely, ande- 
sitic. 

MINERALS. 

Colorado is exceptionally rich in rare and precious minerals. The best known locality is 
in the Archaean area around Pike&apos;s Peak, extending west as far as Florissant and north to 
Platte Mountain. Here are found very fine topaz, amazon-stone, zircon and phenacite crys- 
tals and a very complete series of cryolite minerals, hitherto known only in Greenland. Boul- 
der county is famous for its great variety of Telluride minerals, many new to science. Topaz 
is also found in the Arkansas valley, in druses in the rhyolite of Nathrop and Chalk Mountain, 
associated in the former locality with fine clear garnets. A great variety of silver, copper 
and bismuth minerals have been obtained from various mining districts. The San Juan and 
Elk Mountains offer a most attractive field for the mineraiogical explorer and have already 
yielded many new and rare mineral species. 

PRECIOUS METALS. 

In the value of its product of precious metals Colorado ranks first among the States. Its 
average annual product may be estimated in round numbers at four million dollars in gold and 
sixteen millions in silver (coining value). Of this value the single district of Leadville pro- 
duces more than halt In other metals its most important products have been lead and 
copper, amounting in a single year to 70,000 tons of the former metal and a thousand tons 
of the latter. Its ores present every variety of mineralogical composition, but that which 
produces the greatest aggregate value is argentiferous galena and its secondary products. 

In geological distribution the ores are as diversified as in their mineralogical constitution. 
In the Archaean are found the Telluride ores of Boulder County, the auriferous pyrites of 
Gilpin County, the argentiferous galena and other silver minerals of Clear Creek and Hall&apos;s 
Valley, and deposits in in the Wet Mountain valley, the Mosquito, Sawatch and other ranges. Ores 
have been extracted from the Cambrian and Silurian in the Mosquito Range, at Red Cliff, atOuray 
and possibly at other localities. From the Lower Carboniferous limestone is derived most of 
the ore of Leadville, of Red Cliff, Aspen, Monarch, Ouray and other mining districts. At the 
Ten Mile district and in various parts of the Elk Mountains and San Juan Mountains ores 
are obtained from the upper horizons of the Carboniferous. Some of the ores from the vi- 
cinity of Breckenridge and of the San Juan region come from Triassic horizons, while 
those in the vicinity of Irwin, Gunnison County, and probably of several other regions not 
yet examined, are found in Cretaceous rocks. While eruptive bodies in some form are an 
almost invariable accompaniment of the valuable concentrations of ore in Colorado, the ore 
itself is rather more frequently found in the associated sedimentary rocks, especially when 
the latter are calcareous. Important deposits are found, however, in the eruptive rocks th^rn- 
gplves, notably in the San Juan region, in Summit District, Rio Grande County and in Wet 
Mountain Valley, (Rosita and Silver Cliff); moreover the so-called fissure veins in the Arch- 
eean are sometimes only mineralized dikes of eruptive rock. 

COAL AND IRON. 

Although the development of these more useful minerals is still in its infincy, amount- 
ing to a million and a quarter tons of the former, and 25,000 tons of the latter, the natural resources 
of th State are most extensive. The coal horizons surround the mountains on every 
side and penetrate many of the interior valleys, while many deposits of iron ore have al- 
ready been discovered, although the industrial conditions h ve not yet developed a very ac- 
tive search. 

Scenery. Colorado presents several types of scenery, each in its way of great interest. On 
the east are the great treeless plains, sloping imperceptibly towards the Mississippi valley. Their 
soil is naturally rich, but, owing to the slight rainfall, only that portion which can be irri- 
gated is available for agriculture, the balance being utilized as pasturage for cattle and sheep. 
Facing the plains is the Colorado or Front Range, whose trend is nearly north and south 
and which is cut by the deep canons of draining mountain streams, utilized by the various 
railroads which reach the interior. Back of this are a series of mountain valleys, the prin- 
cipal of which are the Wet Mountain Valley, San Luis Park, South Park, Middle Park and 
North Park ; all but the last of these are &quot; penetrated or traversed by railroads. West of 
these is a second series of mountain ranges forming the general line of elevation known as 
the Park Range, but which is less regular in structure than the Colorado Range. Opposite 
the South Park it is split Into two ranges, the Mosquito and the Sawatch, by the deep

longitudinal valley of the Upper Arkansas River. West of these two systems of elevation stretches 
the Mesa region of the basin of the Colorado river, characterized by its intricate net- 
work of deep, narrow canons cut through soft horizontal strata, which finds its most striking 
development beyond the boundaries of the state, in Utah and Arizona. Detached moun- 
tain masses stretch out on the western flanks of the ranges above mentioned into this pla- 
teau region. Of these the most important are the San Juan Mountains and the Elk Moun- 
tains, on the south and north of the Gunnison River respectively, which are largely composed 
of eruptive rocks, and some smaller masses such as the Sierra La Sal, etc., which apparent- 
ly owe their elevation entirely to eruptive action. Types of the varied scenery of these va- 
rious regions can be seen from the railroad itself, but a far better knowledge is obtained by 
short excursions which can be readily made from various central points. 

From Denver excursions may be made 1st to Estes Park, 75 miles north, (two hours by 
rail and four hours by stage) a most beautiful mountain valley in the granite mountains, and 
the only one to which the name &quot; Park,&quot; as it is understood outside of Colorado, is properly 
applicable. A good hotel and various ranche boarding houses afford accommodations to the 
tourist and a great variety of excursions may be made on horseback or in wagon. Long&apos;s 
Peak, the most precipitous in the Colorado Range, can be easily ascended on foot by those whos e 
nerves are sufficiently steady. The air is dry, cool, yet mild, and peculiarly healthful. Its 
elevation is about 8,000 feet. 

2nd. By rail to Boulder and tnence by wagon or on horseback to the famous Telluride 
mines of Boulder County. 

3rd. By rail past the volcanic mesas of Golden, up Clear Creek Canon to the mines of 
Central City and by Idaho Springs (thermal baths) to Georgetown;; from Graymont, the ter- 
minus, it is an easy two-hours&apos; walk or rid* to the summit of Gray&apos;s Peak. 

4th. By rail to Morrison upturned Mesozoic strata, carrying gypsum and remains of At- 
lanta saurus. 

5th. By the Denver and South Park Railroad up the Platte canon to the South Park. 
Thence either across Mount Guyot to Breckenridge, and up the Ten-Mile valley to Leadville; 
or southwest across South Park to Buena Vista in the Arkansas Valley, and over the Sa- 
watch Range, by the Alpine Pass, to Pitkin and Gunnison. 

6th. By the Denver and Rio Grande to Palmer Lake (summer hotel and pfeasure 
grounds) on the divide between the South Platte and the Arkansas rivers and close to the 
Foot hills of the Colorado Range. 

The metallurgist will be repaid by a visit to the Argo (copper) and Grant (lead) smelt- 
ing works on the outskirts of Denver. 

From Colorado Springs (excellent hotel &quot;The Antlers&quot;). By carriage or rail (four miles) 
to Manitou, the fashionable summer resort of Colorado. Many hotels. Iron and soda (effer- 
vescent) springs. Caverns in the Silurian limestone. Ute Falls (granite). Garden of the Gods 
(upturned red sandstones). Glen Eyrie (residence of General Palmer), with picturesque gorge 
in Archaean and Cambrian just back of the house. Ascent of Pike&apos;s Peak (station of the 
U. S. Signal Service on the summit) can be made in a day either on foot or on horseback. 
Drive across Ute Pass to Manitou Park, a pretty mountain valley containing a remnant of 
Cambrian and Silurian strata, deposited in a bay of the original Archaean land mass, which 
have escaped erosion. Near Cheyenne Mountain are found &apos;the rare cryolite minerals, and 
south of Manitou near Florissant amazon stone, topaz and phenacite. 

The projected Midland Railroad (broad gauge) starting Irom Colorado Springs will cross 
the Ute Pass, traverse the lower part of South Park, crossing the Mosquito Range (Palaeo- 
zoic and Archaean) to Leadville, and thence across the Sawatch Range (Archaean) to Aspen (silver 
ores in lower Carboniferous limestone) on the Roaring Fork of Grand River. 

Pueblo is of more importance as an industrial centre, than from a picturesque point of view. To 
it are tributary the Canon City coal fields, and those worked by the Atchison, Topeka&amp;Sante Fe 
R. R., and the Denver&amp;Rio Grande Railway in the vicinity of Trinidad and El Moro, while the 
various interior railroad lines centering here communicate with the principal mining districts of the 
state. Two large lead smelting works and one Bessemer plant are already established in its imme- 
diate vicinity. 

From Pueblo railroad lines run south, southwest, west, north and east. South, the Atchison, 
Topeka&amp;Santa Fe leads to New Mexico, and the southern overland route. Southwest, the D.&amp;R. 
G. Railway crosses the La Veta pass, just north of the Spanish Peaks and south of Blanca Peak, into 
the broad alluvial valley of San Luis Park. From Alamosa a branch follows up the Rio Grande river 
to Wagon Wheel Gap, now a favorite summer resort ; another branch runs south down the same river 
into New Mexico; while the main line crosses a low range of eruptive rocks resting on Archeen, 
past the Toltec gorge, and then crossing the Cretaceous and Tertiary plains of the basin of the San 
Juan River to Durango(coal mines and smelting works), penetrates the San Juan Mountains through 
the magnificent gorge of the Amimas, having its present terminus at Silverton in Baker&apos;s Park. 
This is the centre of the boldest and most precipitous mountain mass in Colorado, as well as of many 
Important mining districts. The Alpine climber will here find many untried peaks to test his 
prowess; the geologist many problems to solve, and the mineralogist an endless variety of mineral 
species to be determined. 

Westward. The main artery of the D.&amp;R. G. Railway reaches the mountains at Cafion City 
(State Penitentiary, Hot Springs and bath, Soda Springs, Lead smelting works, Limestone quarries, 
and petroleum wells in the country around). From here a branch runs southwest through the nar- 
row gorge of Grape Creek to Wet Mountain valley and the mines of Silver Cliff. The main line fol- 
lows up the Arkansas river through the magnificent canon, known as the Royal Gorge, and through 
minor valleys cutting across the north end of the Sangre de Cristo range and the south end of the 
Mosquito Range to Salida at the junction of the South Arkansas with the main stream. From Salida 
the original line follows the fine north and south valley of the Upper Arkansas, carved mainly out 
of Archeen granite, to Leadville, the great silver mining centre. From Leadville the beautiful Twin 
Lakes, formed by the damming up by terminal moraines of a mountain stream issuing from 
a deep gorge in the Sawatch Range, can be reached in a drive of 16 miles. A good macadamized road 
leads across the Arkansas valley (six miles) to Soda Springs, at the foot of Mount Massive (14,298 
feet). Beyond Leadville, branches of the D.&amp;R. G. Railway cross the Continental divide to the

north, one descending Eagle River to the mining to\vn of Red Cliff, the other the Ten-Mile river to 
the Middle Park, each valley being extremely precipitous and picturesque. 

From Salida again, the present main line goes westward, past Poncho Springs (Thermal baths), 
sending off a short branch to the northwest to the Monarch mining district, and southward across 
Poncho Pass into the San Luis Valley and the iron mines at Hot Springs. The main line crosses the 
south end of the Sawatch range by the Marshall Pass and follows the Gunaison river down to the 
Utah boundary line. From Gunnison City (LaVeta Hotel) a branch runs north to Crested Butte, a 
good centre for visiting the wild and beautiful scenery of the Elk Mountains, and the mines of an- 
thracite and bituminous coal, of silver, copper and lead. The forest growth and vegetation is gen- 
erally more luxuriant on these western slopes thin on the east flanks of the mountains. Below 
Gunnison the railroad passes part way through the cafion of the Gunnison (known as the Black 
canon) and then diverges to the south into the Uncompaghre valley. From Montrose in this valley 
*he San Juan mountains may be reached by stage by way of Ouray, probably the most picturesquely 
situated town in the state. &quot; Further westward the country assumes the somewhat monotonous but 
striking appearance characteristic of the Colorado plateau region.

building stone. Quarries near Buffalo Station. 

5. Estabrook Grant. Granite gneiss, schists (some amphibolites) and gray granite. 

6. Webster. Branch Valley leads to Geneva district and Hall Valley mines. Bismuth silver ores. 

7. Booster Kenosha. Gray granite and some eruptives. 

8. Como. Coal mines west of town. At Hamilton, higher up Tarryall Creek, are abandoned gold 
placers. Here was the first discovery of gold in Colorado west of the Colorado range. 

9. Boreas. Mt, Guyot to the east, almost entirely made up of eruptive rocks, with a few caught 
up fragments of sedimentary beds. 

10. Argentine Mayo. The beds are much disturbed and probably faulted on the slopes of the 
range toward Blue River valley, and the horizons have not been determined with certainty. 
The .sandstones on the lower slopes probably belong to the Dakota, and the black clays higher up 
may be Colorado. 

11. Breckenridge Dickey. Road follows valley of Blue River. Rich gold placers have been 
washed in this and tributary valleys. 

12. Curtain Birds Eye. On the east side of the narrow valley of Ten Mile Creek which the 
R. R. appends, the steep slopes of the Mosquito Range furnish excellent exposures of Archaean 
rock*. White veins of pegmatite and dark bands of hornblendic schists stand out prominently in 
the generally light-colored mass of granite-gneiss. About three miles above Wheeler the R. R. 
crosses the Mosquito fault, and passes from Archaean into Upper Carboniferous and intrusive 
porphyry. 

13. Alicante. The Mosquito fault crosses the Arkansas valley in a north and south direction 
about tangent to the curve or loop of the railroad. By its displacement the Archaean rocks forming 
the high mountains to the east have been lifted up and brought into juxtaposition with Upper 
Carboniferous and Triassie strata on the west. 

14. Leadville. Silver mines in Carboniferous limestone. Gold placers in gulches. 

15. Fairplay. Quarternary gravels which have been washed for gold. 

16. Platte River. Salt Springs and gypsum deposits west of here. 

17. Nathrop. Ridge east of station, rhyolite carrying topaz. 

18. P\tk\n. Ridge of Palaeozoic limestones to the northwest. 

19. Louisville. Fault in R. R. cut one half mile south. In opposition are seen the coal s.s. at 
base of Laramie, and the shales and iron-stones above the sandstone.

22. The road crosses vertical outcrop of Laramie and Dakota Cretaceous and of Triassic Red 
beds before entering the Archaean. Excellent fire clay found in the Dakota, north of Golden. 

23. Granite, granite-gneiss and schists. 

24. Gold mines in granite-gneiss often associated with porphyry dikes. Main ore is auriferous 
pyrites. Treated in amalgamating mills. 

25. Georgetown. Silver mines mainly in granite-gneiss and intrusive porphyry. Main ore 
argentiferous galena, pyrite and sulphides of silver. Ore mostly treated in smelting works, after 
being dressed and concentrated here.

consists of Archcean crystalline schists, with Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata upon the slopes. 

7. Rawling&apos;s Peak consists of an Archcean mass, surrounded by Palaeozoic and Mesozoic beds. 
In the coal measures is an interesting body of iron ore. 

8. Northeast from Point of Rocks is a remarkable outburst of leucite rocks. 

9. There is exposed here an interesting section of Laramie coal rocks. 

10. Near Rock Springs the coal formations are well shown. 

11. Along the bluffs of Green River are seen the best exposures of the Green River Eocene. 
These beds are celebrated for the fine specimens of fossil fishes preserved in the shales. 

12. On the south of the railroad, between Church Buttes and Carter, may be seen distant but 
good views of the Uinta Range. 

13. About three miles north of Evanston are situated the Rocky Mountain and Wyoming coal 
Company&apos;s mines, where there is a good section of the Laramie beds. These mines have supplied 
immense quantities of coal used by the Union and Central Pacific roads. 

14. From Wahsatch to Echo the railroad passes through Echo Caflon, where are exposed both 
the VermilHon Creek and Laramie formations, the former lying unconformably upon the latter. 

15. Passing through Weber Caflon, from Lost Creek to Weber Station, there is exposed a series 
of beds from the top of the Jurassic, through the Triassic, Upper Coal measures, Weber Quartzite 
to the base of the Lower Coal measures. 

16. At the Devil&apos;s Gate the Archsean rocks of the Wahsatch Range are characteristically shown. 

17. The terraces of Lake Bonneville, which stand over 950 feet above the present level of Salt 
Lake, may be seen from Uinta station. They may be easily traced all the way from Ogden to Lucin. 

18. On the north side of the railroad at Matlin the old lake terraces are distinctly cut in basalt. 

19. From Wells there is a fine view of the East Humboldt range. Mount Bonpiand attains an 
elevation of 11,321 feet above sea-level. 

20. Just oast of Osino the railroad passes through Osino Canon, exposing a good section in the 
Weber Quartzite. 

21. In the neighborhood of Elko may be seen the Green River Eocene, Humboldt Pliocene, 
characteristic outbursts of rhyolite and &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; hot springs. 

22. In Moleen Canon the Carboniferous formations are well shown. The limestones of Moleen 
Peak, just south of the railroad, carry large numbers of coal measure fossils. 

23. Palisade Cation cuts through rhyolites. Andesites are also exposed. 

24. Mill City is the most convenient place to leave the railroad in order to study the character- 
istic Triassic formations of the West Humholdt Range. 

25. From Humboldt there is a fine view of the West Humboldt Range. In the neighborhood 
are some interesting outbursts of basalt and a deposit of sulphur. 

26. In the Montezuma Range, west of Brown&apos;s station, the volcanic rocks are well shown. It id 
an interesting place to study rhyolites and basalts. 

27. The Hot Springs, a short distance east of the station, reach the surface near the base of 
basaltic hills. 

28. The Truckee Canon, just east of Wadsworth, offers remarkable outbursts of a great variety 
of volcanic rocks. There may be seen here basalts, rhyolites and andesites. Tourists leave the 
railroad here for Pyramid Lake. 

29. Propylite is the characteristic volcanic rock, which carries the Comstock Lode. A. H. 

30. The last rail completing the Pacific railroads, from Omaha to San Francisco, was laid May 
10,1869.

31. The ge*1ogy of most of the stations on the Utah and Northern Division is given by 
Mr. Hague, but the editor has not been able to obtain complete assignments of formations. The 
geology of some parts of the great West has been necessarily done in something of a reconnoissance 
way, and often before the railroads irere located, so that accurate statements are impossible. The 
altitudes have been kindly furnished by Mr. Henry Gannett, Chief Geographer, U. S. Geological 
Survey.

32. The geology from Granger to Squaw Creek is by Prof. \V. B. Scott of Princeton University ; 
thence t-&gt;Michaud; it is given on the authority of an atlas of the U. S. Survey, which was made be- 
fore the road was located, and the assignments must, therefore, be taken with allowance. 
Geology from American Falls to the Oregon line and on the Wood River Branch is by Mr. John 
B. Hastings, M. E., F. G. 8. A., of Ketchum, Idaho. Altitudes on all this line by Mr. Gannett. 
33. These late Tertiary and Quaternary basalts form part of the great Northwestern lava-flood, 
of Northern California, Northwestern Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Montana and British Columbia.

with Chinoak salmon and smaller salmon (oncorhynchus norka) locally called redfish from the color. , 
Tertiary trachyte underlies stratified drift. J. B. H. 

39. Cheyenne and Northern, and Tremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley are by Prof. G. E. I 
Bailey, of the Dakota School of Mines, Rapid City, South Dakota. A portion of the latter road 
should be in the Nebraska chapter, but was overlooked when that chapter was printed, 

40. By Mr. G. K. Gilbert, Geologist, U. S. Geological Survey. 

41. From Acheron to Price the road follows a great monoclinal valley overlooked on the north \ 
by the Book Cliffs (Cretaceous.) G. K. G. 

42. The north end of the Oquirrh Range from Chambers to Lake Point is finely carved by old j 
shore lines of Lake Bonneville. These extend up to 1,000 feet above Great Salt Lake. G. K. G. 1 

43. From Spanish Fork to Lehi the road is in Utah valley and commands a view of the old \ 
shore lines of Lake Bonneville. A large delta of the old lake forms the terrace near Provo.

Weber River, a long stretch of Wahsatch range comes into view. From Fault Canon, north ; 
Archsean, at base; Palaeozoic, above; between Fault Canon and Centreville station, including i 
Weber Canon, all Archeean. Then begins the great synclinal, as seen from along here. The north j 
end, a little south of east from Centreville (Cambrian to Carboniferous) shows on top of mountains; 
and the south end. Twin Peaks (Cambrian), and Lone Peak (granite intruded through Archsean), , 
in farthest distance, showing over lower Tertiary hills south of Centreville. The axis of the 
synclinal (of solt, Mesozoic rocks) being low and hidden. The old lake terrace is very clearly j 
seen. W. M. D.

Lake BonneviUe is the name given to the great Quaternary lake, whose boundary has been 
traced by its shore lines and deposits to and into Nevada on the west, Idaho on the north, as far 
east as Salt Lake City and in bays of which Utah and Sevier Lakes are the remnants, to the south 
as far as Frisco. The Great Salt Lake is the reduced remnant of this great sheet of water. The 
highest, or BonneviUe, shore line is 1,000 feet above the level of Great Salt Lake, and is one of the 
most conspicuous water lines. Of the numerous lower lines, marking the heights at which the 
water lingered, one lying 400 feet below the highest is called the Provo shore line. Between the 
BonneviUe ana Provo lines are four or five prominent lines. 

The following, from Mr. G. K. Gilbert&apos;s report on Lake BonneviUe, gives, in a general way. 
Its origin. * The lowlands of the &apos;Great Basin&apos; are valleys without drainage to the ocean, and 
vhen the climate of the Glacial Epoch gave them a more generous supply of moisture, the surplus 
vxs accumulated in their lower parts in quantities which bore a definite relation to the climate. 
When for centuries the climate became more humid, the lake rose and encroached upon the land, 
and wh/-n the reverse was true and aridity prevailed, they dried away and the land was laid bare.&apos;* 
The origin and history of the great lakes of former periods is a subject of absorbing interest to the 
student of geologic science, and none offers a better field than Lake BonneviUe. [Ed.]

7. Upper Loda Springs. Near Upper Loda Springs, an ancient Lava stream from Mt. Shasta 
enters the Canon of the Sacramento River, which it follows tor nearly 50 miles. Lava seen at many 
places clinging to sides of old Cafion, especially near Delta, 

8. Dr. Dawson discovered in Oregon, west of the Cascade Mountains, no traces of general 
glaciation or deposits like northern drift. There is a remarkable absence of any well marked ter- 
races or benches, although the bottoms of the valleys suggest that the sea may have at one time 
flowed into them. The almost complete absence of lakes or ponds is very remarkable, and con- 
trasts -trongly with the innumerable lake basins of British Columbia. The drift appears at Tacoma 
and other places in Washington. 

9. This line of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. traverses a region covered by the great 
lava sheet, but just what formations are exposed at given stations can not be determined from any 
sources at the command of the editor. Prof. Condon&apos;s notes, the general note 39 on the Northern 
Pacific, and Mr. Willis&apos; notes on pages 265 and 266 will throw some Tight on the geology of this sec- 
tion. Other lines of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. will be found in the chapter on the 
Northern Pacific. J. R. M. 

10. The notes on this line were prepared before the road was built (see Note 3.) and as they are 
all that I can obtain for this line I have inserted the old stage stations in parentheses. J. R. M.

*Explanatory Note. This chapter was prepared by my father just before his death, princi- 
pally from notes Burnished by Dr. J. G. Cooper, whose name is given at note 1 as the authority for 
most of the chapter. Through some misunderstanding the plates were made before Dr. Cooper had 
finally corrected the proofs, and in the haste to release the type an unusual number of errors, most 
of them in orthography, were overlooked. Many of these are apparent and need no further explan- 
ation ; others are explained in the errata at the end of the chapter. While it is thought best to 



publish the chapter as it stands, it is only just to Dr. Cooper to say that he is in no way responsible 
for the insertion of, or the statements in, any of the notes or tables, except his own, also that he 
would make some alterations, based upon recent investigations, if the whole chapter were revised.

General Note on the Topography of California. 

The two prominent features, extending through nearly the entire length of the State of Califor- 
nia are the snow-capped range of the Sierra Nevada on the eastern border, and the low Coast 
Range, or rather belt of ranges, bordering the sea coast on the west. Between the two lies the great 
valley of California, drained from the northward by the Sacramento, and from the southward by the 
San Joaquin rivers, and these uniting near the middle of the length of the valley, pass westward 
through the narrow Strait of Carquines into San Francisco Bay, and thence through the Golden 
Gate into the Pacific Ocean. These two rivers receive nearly all their waters from the Sierra Nevada, 
the streams flowing landward from the Coast Range being insignificant. The main drainage of the 
Coast Range is to seaward, through many small rivers bordered by fertile valleys. The immediate 
coast is mostly abrupt and rocky and frequently mountainous. The Great Valley, from the Tejon 
Mountains on the south to Red Bluff on the north where the valley proper terminates, is about tour 
hundred miles in length, and its width varies from over sixty to somewhat less than forty miles. 
The northern part, or Sacramento Valley, is about 160 miles long, from Red Bluff to the Calaveraa 
River, and is seven miles wide at the head, widening in three miles to fifteen, and then expanding 
suddenly to about forty miles. The southern or San Joaquin valley is two hundred and forty miles 
long, and its prominent topographical feature is theTulare Lake and the basin surrounding it. 
E. W. tiilgard, in Cotton Report of U. S. Census. 

General Note on the Geology of California. Broadly speaking the Coatt Range of Cali- 
fornia consists of Tertiary and Cretaceous, mostly sandstones and calcareous clay slates, almost 
everywhere greatly disturbed, folded, and frequently highly metamorphosed, and traversed by 
dikes of eruptive rocks and upheaval axes. In the portion north of San Francisco these ore fre- 
quently by tufaceous and scoriaceous, or crystalline lava flows, emanating from distinct volcanic 
vents now extinct. 

In contrast to the Coast Range the Sierra Nevada has in general a central axis of granite or . 
other rocks, occasionally traversed by volcanic vents, on the flanks of which lie more or less crys- 
talline and metarnorphic slates or schists of Palaeozoic, Triassic, and Jurassic age, with edges up- 
turned at a high angle or sometimes vertical. Abutting against this, the proverbial &quot;bed rock&quot; of 
the California miners, there lies on the border of the great valley strata of marine deposits, mostly 
of the Tertiary, but northward also of the Cretaceous age, which are but slightly disturbed, and into 
which the rivers flowing from the Canons of the Sierra have cut their immediate valleys, flanked by 
bluffs from forty to seventy feet high. From opposite San Francisco northward, on the lower foot 
hills, appear immense gravel beds, mostly gold bearing, and these are partly over-laid by eruptive 
or volcanic out-flows and tufaceous rocks, also accounted as belonging to the Tertiary age. In the 
northern portion of the Sierra region the eruptive rocks become more and more prominent, cover- 
ing an enormous area called the &quot;lava bed&quot; in the northeastern part of the State, and, as in the 
Cascade Range, in Oregon, forming the body of the comparatively low range, upon which the vol- 
canic cone of Mount Shasta is superimposed. (See Note 39 on Northern Pacific Railroad.)

Apart from the Cretaceous and Tertiary beds on the borders of the great valley, there are within 
the vail-y terraces and bench marks showing the existence in Quaternary times of a great fresh- 
water lake, which was subsequently drained Dy the erosion or breaking, first of the Strait of Car- 
quines, and ultimately of that of the Golden Gate. Prior to the latter event, the drainage of the great 
valley pa-ssed through the Santa Clara and Pajaro valleys into the Bay of Monterey. The latest sur- 
face deposits are in the San Joaquin valley, mostly sandy, and in the Sacramento valley more com- 
monly clay &quot; adobe,&quot; corresponding to the composition of the Coast Ranges opposite to each district. 
E. IF. Hilgard, in Census Cotton Report. 

As the railroads are nearly all constructed in the valleys on the Quaternary formations just 
described, there is very little variety in the tabular list of formations passed over and immediately 
adjoining the railroads. The notes on adjacent mountains impart some interest to the country for 
the geologist. 

1 . By Dr. J. G. Cooper, of Hayward&apos;s, Cal., late Assistant State Geologist under Professor Whitney, 
with some notes derived from Prof. E. W. Hilgard&apos;s U. S. Census Cotton Report, and other sources. 

2. Tertiary. Both marine and fresh water in the Coast Range and Sierra Nevada Mountains, but 
not yet defined and much of it volcanic. 

3. Archaean. Much of the Granite is also eruptive (19. Tertiary), but may be remelted Archsean. 

4. Boca to Cisco. Volcanic and glacial, with 1. Archeean (granite) and metamorphosed rocks of 
uncertain age. Metalliferous but not rich. Mt. Stanford, northward, is 9,500 feet high. 

5. Emigrant Gap to Auburn. Glacial and detrital above 16. Triassic and 17. Jurassic sandstones, con- 
taining most of the gold mined on the western slopes. A fine iron mine seven miles north of Auburn. 

C. Newcastle to Rocklin. Detrital above 1. Archeean granite, surface mining for gold, platinum, 
telburet of silver and nickel. Diamonds also occur in small quantities. 

7. Antelope. The mountains to the east produce lime, marble, copper ore and some lignite (19 c. 
Pliocene.) 

8. Stockton. Mt. Diablo, 3,87G feet high, is in full view and easily ascended from near the coal mines. 

9. Oakland and San Francisco. The Golden Gate and Bay of San Francisco. This Bay has been 
celebrated, from the time of its first discovery, as among the finest in the world, and is justly entitled 
to that character, even under the seaman&apos;s view of a mere harbor. But when all the accessory 
advantages which belong to it are taken into the account, it rises into an importance far above that 
of a mere harbor. The Bay of San Francisco is separated from the sea by low (Cretaceous) mountain 
ranges. Looking from the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, the Coast Mountains present an apparently 
continuous line, with only a single gap, resembling a mountain pass. This is the entrance to the 
pn-at hay, and is the only water communication from the coast to the interior country. Approaching 
from tin- -- ii. thf coast presents a bold outline. On the south the bordering mountains come down 
in a narrow ridge of broken hills, terminating in a precipitous point, against which the sea breaks 
heavily. On the northern side the mountains present a bold promontory, rising in a few miles to a 
height of two or thre.- thousand feet. Between these points is the strait, about one mile broad in the 
narrowst part, and five rnil-. long from the sea to the bay. This passage is called the Golden Gate. 
The form of the entrance into the Bay of San Francisco, and its advantages for commerce, suggested 

te long before the discovery of gold in California, and by analogy to the Golden Horn of Con- 
stantinople. Passing through this gate, the bay opens to the right and left, extending in each direc- 
tion about thirty-five miles, having a total length of more than seventy, and a coast of about two 
hundred and seventy-five miles. It is divided by straits and projecting points into three separate 
bays, of which the northern is called San PaMo, the middle one Suison, and the southern San 
Francis. Within, the view is that of an interior lake of deep water lying between parallel ranges 
of mountains, rising two thousand feet above the water, and behind the rugged peak of Mount 
Diablo, thirty-seven hundred and seventy feet high, over-looking the bay and surrounding country. 
Islands, which have the bold character of the shores, some mere maraefl of rock, and others origi- 
nally grass-covered, rising to the height of three and eight hundred feet, break the surface of the 
bay,&quot; and add to its picturesque beauty. J. C. FREMONT.

10. San Francisco. The rock on which the city rests belong entirely to the metamorphic-creta-. 
ceous series, and is not the Lignite or Eocene, or Tejon beds which bear the coal, as given in the first 
-edition. H. W. TURNEB. 

11. The islands in the bay are all like San Francisco in structure. 

12. Elmira to Sacramento. The coast range westward, 5,000 to 8,000 feet high, is little explored,, 
but resembles that south of San Francisco Bay, with much more volcanic, and towards the north 
auriferous, but only granitic or metamorphic rocks, containing the gold quartz, underlie the creta- 
ceous, as far as now known. 

13. Tormay. Fossils of both formations are more plenty and better than elsewhere near San 
Francisco Bay. 

14. Cornwall. Good fossils are to be found in Kirker&apos;s pass, three miles south of Cornwall. Thei 
-coal mines, five miles south, are not now worked, but a ride to the summit of Mt. Diablo, ten miles, 
is interesting. 

15. Lathrop to Goshen. The &quot; High Sierra,&quot; 14,000 to 15,000 feet, can be seen on clear days. The i 
mountains eastward have the same general character as on the line from Boca to Sacramento, with 
the addition of some 18. Cretaceous uplifts near base. 

16. Salida. Table Mountain, made famous by Bret Harte&apos;s humorous poem, rising some 2,000 
feet above the Stanislaus river, has a length of about 30 miles, its flat top being from 1,200 to 1,800 feet 
wide. A prominent feature in the topography of Amador, Calaveras and Tuolumne counties is the 
occurrence of belts of lava-capped hills and mountains, as well as deposits of other volcanic material, 
the remains of what were once lava flows from the Sierra mountains westward. The Table Mountain 
is a flow of lava, originating in the lofty volcanic region beyond the &quot; big trees &quot; of Calaveras. 

17. Tipton. A great bed of magnesite twenty miles east. 

18. Sumner. A great vein of antimony overlies 40 miles due south near Mt. Pinos, 6,000 feet ; 
elevation of mountain being 7,000 feet. 

19. Pampa. For several miles east the roads pass through hills of 19. Pliocene, Tertiary gravela&gt;and clays, with volcanic and other detritus overlying metamorphic shales, etc., that may be 18. 
Cretaceous or 19. Eocene. 

20. Keene. Broken terraces of 19 c. Pliocene, Tertiary age, chiefly of volcanic materials for flvei 
or six miles.

22. Tehachapi. Gold mines in gravel, and quartz veins near by. 

23. Cameron. The pass through Sierra Nevada here resembles other sections northward ; some 
auriferous slates, 17. Jurassic (?), are worked in vicinity also. 

24. Mojave. The desert region known as the Mojave Desert, and east of the Sierra Nevada the 
Colorado Desert or basin, reaches far eastward into Arizona, and affords, by this route, one of the 
strangest railroad rides in the world. It is a sandy barren waste, interspersed with salt lakes and 
alkali&apos; tracts, destitute of all timber growth, except occasional tracts of yucca, small nut pines and 
juniper In the south it is subject to very frequent and severe sand storms. Enough of it to satisfy 
the traveler is seen along the line of this railroad for hundreds of miles. A boiling Mud Lake is 
only a few hundred yards southwest of the road (See notes 25, 29, 30 and 31.) But probably the culmi- 
nating point of this fearful desert is found in &quot; Death&apos;s Valley,&quot; far from any railway station, near the 
eastern line of California. It is four hundred feet below the level of the sea, while but seventy miles 
west of it are clustered a number of the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada, many of which are from 
12,000 to 15,000 feet in height. For 45 miles in length and 15 in width along its centre it is a salt 
mar.-h with a thin layer of soil, and a large portion of the basin is covered with an incrustation of 
salt and soda several inches thick, destitute of the slightest vegetation. The heat of the valley is 
fearful during the summer. Whatever may be the rock formation underlying the desert is of no 
importance, as its existence is not due to that, but to the aridity of the climate and to the excessive 
deposits of alkali on the surface and mingled with the superficial formations. For a description of 
the alkali, see note No. 25. 

25. Rosamond. The Alkali, so injurious to extensive regions of the southwest, has been carefully 
studied in California by Prof. E. W. Hilgard. His analyses show the presence of from one to four 
per cent of these injurious salts in 100 of soil. Of these salts, from 20 to 50, and in some cases 75 per 
cent., the proportions varying very much in different places, is sulphate of sodium or glauber salt ; 
from 10 to 20, and sometimes 30 per cent, chloride of sodium or common&apos; salt, from 15 to 60 per cent. 
of carbonate of soda or sal-soda, sometimes from five to 20 per cent, of sulphate of potassium, a less 
quantity of carbonate of potassium or saleratus, and other salts injurious to vegetation in various 
quantities, phosphates, nitrates, etc. 

The remedy for the reclamation of alkali lands is, of course/the leaching out of the injurious salts, 
by flooding with pure water and underdraining. Unfortunately, in many cases, the alkali returns and 
again increases on irrigated lands, rising from below through the agency of the water evaporated on 
the surface, which causes a greater depth of sub-soil to be drawn upon for its alkali, where, too, the 
soil is more highly charged with it than at the surface. The origin of the alkali is not fully deter- 
mined. Professor Hilgard thinks much of this salty matter pre-existed in the geological strata, as 
it is seen to &quot; bloom out&quot; from the rocks, and that from these it was .continually washed out in Quat- 
ernary times by percolating water, when great lakes covered the valleys of California, for a time held 
in suspense and then precipitated, or in some cases by the drying-up of the lakes the salts were 
deposited, which are now found accumulated in the soil. But the very great quantities of the alkali 
may be said not to be satisfactorily accounted for. The alkali has a corrosive action upon the root 
frowns and upper roots of plants. It seems that the cotton plants, having long tap roots, it is less 
injurious to them than to others. Another injurious effect it has in hardening clay soils, producing a 
tamped condition, instead of the flocculent state which we see in a well tilled and productive soil. 

26. Acton. Iron and copper mines occur near here. 

27. San Fernando Tunnel. On west side of pass the sandstones reappear with marine fossils. 
Tunnel through 18. Cretaceous and 19. Tertiary hills. 

i Angeles. The hills northward are metamorphic (18.Cretaceous?),with a great 19.Tertiary (19 b. 
i e and 19 c. Pliocene) basin between them and the range north of San Fernando. To the east more 
metamorphic and granitic, with auriferous quartz,copper,etc. The 19.Tertiary contains much petroleum. 

Los Angeles. The traveler from the eastward who has begun to despair of ever seeing anything 
greener than giant cacti and adamantine vegetation which dispenses with water, is agreeably sur- 
pris.-d as he approaches Los Angeles. A drive through the place will enable you to appreciate the 
reasons which induced the Spanish founders to give the city its name. W. H. R. 

Los Angdet to Aanaheim. Alabaster and gypsum occur in low 19. Tertiary hills near here. 

Los Ann? 1 m to El Carco. About half way the metamorphic and granitic hills approach the road. 
Much 19 h. Miocene Tertiary, with poor lignite, caps these on the west. 

Los AngeU to St. Monica. See note 89.

29. San Gorgonio. Metamorphic auriferous rocks (secondary) overlying granite, chiefly on the 
west side. San Barnardino Mountain is 11,GOO feet high. 

San Gorgonio to El Rio. The railroad plunges into the most remorseless, cruel waste of sand and 
rock I every beheld. It spreads out up to the foot of the rugged hills of the Barnardino range, an 
abomination of desolation, compared with which the Lybrian Desert is the Garden of Hesperides. I 
cannot describe, nor could I at any time hope to give an adequate conception of this dreadful wilderness. 
For 107 miles there is not a drop of water to be found, but Nature, as if to take away the reproach of 
permitting such a vast blotch on her fair face, kindly threw in Fata Morgana. We saw with delight 
wide spread lakes, with fairy islands in the midst ; placid seas washing the base of the distant hills. 
This baked and dreary expanse extends from near San Gorgonio nearly to El Rio. 

WM. HOWABD RUSSEL. 

30. Indio to Flowing Wells. For 61 miles the road is below sea level, going down to 263 feet on 
the border of 19. Pliocene Tertiary lake bed which contains fresh water fossil shells, and below them 
beds of salt, from being once the head of the Gulf of California ; on its west side are 19 b. Miocene 
Tertiary sandstone strata, with marine fossils, lying against east slope of Coast Mountains. Hot 
springs and mud volcanoes also occur in the lake bed near its centre ; some of our rarest minerals 
are found in the neighboring mountains. 

31. Dos Palmas. A few miles southwest of this place is a broad valley in which is the dry bed 
of a lake forty miles in circumference. Nearly in the centre ot this plain, there is a lake of boiling 
mud about half a mile in length by five hundred yards in width. In this curious caldron the thick, 
grayish mud is constantly in motion, hissing and bubbling, with jets of boiling water and clouds of 
sulphurous vapor and steam bursting through the tenaceous mud and rising high in the air with 
reports often heard at a considerable distance. The whole district around the lake trembles under 
foot, and subterranean noises are heard in all directions. 

32. Deming. The San Luis Mountains, on the Mexican side of the river, rise abruptly from the 

g&apos;ain, as they run south, and assume by far the most formidable appearance of any range west of the 
io Grande. Tombstone mining region is in this mountain. This stupendous range of Mexican 
mountains drops abruptly a few miles north of the boundary, as if to make room for a railroad to 
connect the Pacific ana Atlantic states. In fact the original boundary line was changed by a second 
treaty, for the express purpose of securing to the United States this great roadway, for at El Paso

the great Rocky Mountain Range of the United States also terminates, thus forming what is truly 
the pato-way of the continent. Between the San Luis Mountains and El Paso are wide plains, 
bounded by detached mountains of metamorphic and other limestones, associated with igneous 
rocks. 

33. El Paso. See notes in Texas chapter on El Paso.&lt;U. Manuelto. A natural bridge discovered and reported by Frederick Gardner, Jr., is situated 
about 20 miles north of the railroad, near the line between New Mexico and Arizona. It is 65 feet 
long, 15 feet wide, two feet thick in the centre, and 15 feet at the sides, and about 30 feet high. This 
triage is formed by a remnant of the over-lying grit, which is continuous with it on both sides. The 
section cut through beneath it is of light and dark red sandstone (16. Triassic.) A short distance otf 
is a petrified forest. The stone tree trunks lie just beneath the soil or half .exposed, fallen in all 
&apos;directions. F. G., in Science for July, 1885.

* By Dr. J. G. Cooper, of California, late Assistant Geologist under Prof. Whitney. Dr. Cooper 
made a journey over this route specially to obtain the geology given in this table and the notes. 

35 Peach Spring Best point now known from which to visit the Grand Canon of the Colorado, 
and the only accessible point from which the descent can be made, by an easily traveled road, into as 
majestic and peculiar canon scenery as is anywhere to be seen. The plates and descriptions by Dr. 
J. S. Newbury, in Ives&apos; Report of 1858, give a fair idea of what is to be seen. Altogether there is 
nothing like this canon. The far-famed Yosemite is more beautiful and more varied ; but not more 
magnificent nor half so strange and weird. A. G., in Science. 

36. The Needles to Edson. Frequent outcrops of Archaean and Metamorphic rocks near road, also 
erupted lavas and volcanic cones of 19. Tertiary age, some perhaps 20. Quaternary. &quot; The Needles &quot; 
themselves are of purple porphyry and trachytic granite worn into sharp peaks. 

37. Danby to Bag-dad. The road passes through the granite pass of Providence Mountains for 
many miles ; the same rocks occur as eastward and containing ores of various kinds. The mountains 
northward resemble those of Nevada, being Paleozoic rocks containing lead and silver, with a little gold. 

38 Ash Hill. The west slope of the mountains descends gradually to Soda Lake, the sink of 
Mojave River. Death&apos;s Valley, described in note No. 24, lies nearly due north from Soda Lake, 75 to 
100 miles distant. 

39. Ludlow to Daggett. 1. Archaean Granite metamorphic and 19. Tertiary volcanic rocks lie at 
the west side of the sink, then cliffs of 19. Tertiary gravels, 50 to 100 feet high for 20 miles, then 
metalliferous rocks (Metamorphic). Abundance of soda and salt in the sink of Mojave River, other 
lake beds also containing borax. 

40. Waterman to Mojave. After rising about 500 feet in the valley of the Mojave River, the road 
leaves it, and for 70 miles passes over an apparently level plain with little rock in sight, much of it 
being barren sand hills or alkaline planes, the rest with low shrubbery or groves of yucca trees 30 
feet high. It is probable that this Quaternary desert covers Tertiary strata even as old as Eocene, 
but fossils are absent. (See Colorado Desert notes, No. 24, 25, 29, 30 and 31.) 

41 Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad. The airline distance is about 16 miles, but the road 
winds among hills containing Archeean granite, 13 b. Sub-Carboniferous limestoue.lG. and 17. Auriferous 
slates and quartz veins ; 19. Tertiary gravels and volcanic strata much intermined. It is the richest 
quarts mining region in California. 

42. San Rafael. Mt. Tamalpais, 2,604 feet high, may be ascended here. Gives a magnificent 
view of the country near San Francisco Bay. 

43. Santa Rosa. Mark West Creek, north and ^rthwest of this place, a branch of the Russian 
River, has along its banks beds of Pliocene or Post Pliocene fossils. (See Palee. of Cal., by Gabb.) 

H. M. T. 

The hills north of Santa Rosa are full of fossils, 19 b. Miocene and 19 c. Pliocene, but the highest 
ridges are more or less 18 c. Lignite and Metamorphic Cretaceous, with some coal, quicksilver, sul- 
phur volcanic dikes frequent. 

44. Cloverdale. The hills to the east of Cloverdale branch contain many small deposits of quick-

* The gravelly hills, with clay, slates and sandstone of fresh water formation, are here 200 feet 
thick or more, and may include the whole Tertiary age. 

t This formation crosses the river near here full of marine fossils, and lies flat on edges of the 
slates below. 

J Very much changed by 19. Volcanic. 

57. Redding. Mt. Shaska, 14,440 feet high, is in view and easily ascended in summer from the 
end of the railroad. Fine Cretaceous fossils are found near here and also beds of fossil wood, and an 
abundance of excellent iron ore is found on Spring Creek, 12 miles to the northwest. The rocks 
from here north are much covered with 19. Tertiary volcanic fragments and ashes, but exposed by 
the deep cuts. 

The Lava Beds. A large portion of the northeastern part of California, to the northern state line and 
spreading over Idaho, Oregon and Washington Territories, is covered to a depth of several hundred 
feet with great beds of lava and other volcanic material. The country has generally a broken surface, 
and is interspersed with hills and high volcanic cones, frequently cut into deep chasms by the few 
streams that occur in this region, and extensive caves have been found under the lava beds. This 
lava section has no arable lands, and it is fit only for grazing purposes. (See Note 39 on Northern 
Pacific Railroad.) E. W. H. 

58. Middle Creek. Much placer mining is done, and quartz veins exist. 

59. Oroville. Tertiary leaves and Lignite, 18. Cretaceous, 14. Sub-Carboniferous fossils found near 
by toward the northeast. 

60. Shingle Spring. Iron, lead and zinc occur near. 

61. Brooklyn. Redwood Peak, 1,635 feet hi^h, is the highest in the range opposite San Fancisco. 
Mission Peak, 34 miles southeast, is 2,566 feet high. 

62. Niles to Haywards. Follows the 20. Quaternary (alluvial), nearly after passing through 
Alameda Canon 10 miles, traversing 19. Tertiary, 19 c. Pliocene and 19 b. Miocene, then lignitic, with 
little coal. 

63. Irvington. Mountains on the east side rise to 4,443 feet, and on the west side to 3,780 feet in ^ 
height. 

64. San Jose. Alum Rock Caflon, about seven miles easterly from San Jose, is a pretty place, 
with Miocene fossils and a good hotel. H. M. T.

There are several short lines in different parts of California, which traverse Quaternary strata, 
but they show nothing beyond what is contained in these notes. 



81. Port Harford. A branch runs northeast of San Luis Obispo, nine miles over rolling table 
land 19. Tertiary and 20. Quaternary; beds of enormous fossil oyster and other shells are common 
near by ; also lignite and petroleum, volcanic and metamorphic hills also lie near, containing quick- 
silver. Limestone, etc., is further north. 

82. Selwyn. Fossils are numerous in the nearly level strata near the coast and probably include 
all the 19. Tertiary divisions. Under these, at Pt. Loma, 18. Cretaceous fossils are found with lignite 
in up-tilted strata, and the bed near Selwyn was confounded with these and described as Cretaceous, 
Division B., at first, but agrees better with the Tertiary. The true Cretaceous again occurs on the 
west slope of the Santa Anna Coast Mountains, five miles north of Fall Brook station. Fine felspar, 
tourmaline and garnets also occur in this range in granite. 

83- Pinacate. A few miles north of the Tamesca Mountains are the tin mines, which will proba- 
bly become of much value, going up to 60 per cent. 

84. Wilmington. A metamorphic (18. Cretaceous) hill north of this harbor. The islands visible 
are similar, with some 20. Quaternary sandstone and Paleozoic rocks. 

85. Qoshen to Caliente. The mountains westward are like those from Pleasanton to Niles, with 
more 19. Tertiary, 19 b. Miocene and 18. Cretaceous. Also 20. Quaternary, volcanic and granite in 
places. The only coal now worked is north of Mt. Diablo and south of Livermore. The granite, of 
the coast ranges at least, is eruptive, and belongs rather to the Quaternary than the Archaean. 

86. Stockton&amp;Visalia Railroad. The most northern group of &quot;Big Trees&quot; is approached by this 
route. 

The Big Trees. One of the greatest curiosities in California consists of the Big Tree Grove, situ- 
ated on the divide between the middle fork of the Stanislaus and the Calaveras rivers, about 20 miles 
east of Mokelumne hill, and at an elevation of 4,759 feet above the level of the sea. The trees range 
in height from 150 to 327 feet, and in diameter from 15 to 30 feet. 

87. Perns Grove to Santa Rosa. The foothills are full of Tertiary fossils (Miocene and Pliocene). 
The metamorphic and volcanic mountains contain valuable quicksilver mines. 

88. Northern Pacific Coast Railroad. The only groves of celebrated &quot; Redwood &quot; tree, accessible 
by railroad, are on this route and northward.

NOTES ON DELAWARE. 

1. Newark. On the plane to the south of Newark, red and white (mottled) clays rise a few feet 
above the surface, covered by a great thickness of Red Gravel and brick clay of Quaternary age. The 
mottled clays are probably the equivalent of the Wealden, the latter sub-division being referred by 
most authors to the Lower Cretaceous, and by a few to the Upper Jurassic. Passing to the north of 
the town, you walk for a mile over a belt of Amphibole trap, beyond which are soft mica schists and 
.granitic gneisses of doubtful Palaeozoic age. Hills from the background of the town, along the slopes 
of which can be traced the terrace of Quaternary gravel. 

2. Wilson. Iron Hill is three miles long by one mile wide, the back bone being a mass of dioritic 
trap and jaspery quartz. The trap is decomposed into a serpentinic earth, which is completely impreg- 
nated with masses of limonite. Several iron ore pits are at present wrought. This dike is entirely 
confined to the area of Wealden clays, but was evidently an island when the latter clays were deposited, 
or at least of an earlier origin than the clays. 

3. Delaware City. At this place a yellow sand marl is succeeded by a calcareous Green Sand of 
an ashy color. This can be seen well exposed along the level of the canal, particularly near St. George&apos;s. 

4. Wilmington. Excellent exposures of Eruptive rocks are obtained along the Brandywine, con- 
sisting of alternate masses of syenitic gneiss, with a predominance of a coarse feldspathic Hypersthene 
Gabbro. 

5. New Castle. One mile south of New Castle, upon the river, is a bluff of white, sandy fire clay. 
This is the only exposure in the State of the lowest member of the Plastic Clay Series, and is overlaid by 
50 feet of mottled clays. 

6. Mt. Pleasant. Two miles to the northwest of this station is the deep cut made by the canal. 
For nearly two miles the green sand rises as high banks upon each side, offering the best exposures of 
the marl in the State. 

7. Smyrna. The Miocene clays are well exposed along Duck Creek, and abound in places in 
characteristic fossils. 

8. Dover. The Miocene clays can be seen back of the town on Jones Creek, and a little to the 
south on Murderkill Creek, Miocene fossils are found in abundance. 

9. Seaford. To the east of Seaford, upon Nanticoke River, a dark blue clay is well exposed. At 
its junction with the overlying loam are found nests of the modern Oyster. This blue clay is found to 
cover all of Sussex County, but is rarely seen, except in the deeper cuttings of the creeks. Its thick- 
ness varies from three to ten feet, beneath which is over forty feet of fine glass sand. The glass sand 
is probably the equivalent of the New Jersey glass sand of Pliocene age. The modern shells, although 
found at the junction of the Blue clay with the overlying gravel, are more imbedded in the latter. I 
therefore regard the gravels as early Quaternary, and the Blue clay as later Pliocene. 

10. Hockessin. At this place are excellent quarries of pure dolomitic marble. Kaolin is also 
worked in abundance. The dolomite beds in Jackson&apos;s quarry form a perfect anticlinal, overlaid by a 
corresponding anticlinal of Mica schist. This dolomitic area is the extremity of a tongue of the same 
rock extending in from Pennsylvania. 

11. Landenberg. Near this place in the limestone quarries the relation of the Potsdam quartzite, 
calciferous marbles and mica schists to each other can be well studied; there are seen three anticlinals 
capping each other, with the mica schists uppermost. 

12. The northern part of the State of Delaware is underlaid by Crystalline rocks, which extend 
from the northern curved boundary of the State to a line crossing the State a little north of the Phila- 
delphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and running in the same direction about N. 50 E. The 

, latter area is divided into two belts of about equal extent. 

(a) A southern club-shaped area, composed of amphibolite schists, with which is associated a 
bluish gray trap, ranging from a quartz diorite to a true hyperite. This area is a continuation of the

syenitic areas of southeastern Pennsylvania, referred by Mr. C. E. Hall to the Laurentian, although 
they may prove to be Huronian, or even later, and probably forms an intrusive mass between the 
Philadelphia gneiss. 

(6) A northern area, the shape of a double convex lens, covered by granitic gneisses and mica 
schists, the equivalent of the Philadelphia gneiss, which by earlier writers has been referred to the 
Montalban, and by later to the Palaeozoic. 

This part of the State has an uneven surface of beautifully rounded hills, with a bold and rounded 
outline, and is elevated several hundred feet above tide water. Limestone also occurs in this primary 
region. It is a nearly pure dolomite in a coarse and fine grained crystalline mass of a white color, with 
at times a bluish tinge. About six miles N. W. of Wilmington is a limited body of serpentine of 
various shades of green, with a heavy vein of granite passing through it. 

South of the Primary or Rocky regions of the State and, indeed, from its lower limit to the south- 
ern boundary of Delaware, the general features of the country are widely different. Instead of a con- 
stant succession of irregular and boldly rounded hills, is presented a comparatively level country or 
table land, gently sloping east and west towards either bay from an elevated strip of land several miles 
in breadth. The streams flow from this east and west through the soft and yielding strata which con- 
stitute the geological formations of a very large portion of the State; these formations being composed 
of clays and sands which are more or less loose in their texture. The surface of the country, originally 
rather flat and level, has been scooped out by brooks and creeks and ram torrents into an undulating 
surface, presenting low hills and bowl-like depressions, sometimes gently sloping, at others with abrupt 
declivities, where the formations offer a sufficient resistance to the agents of denudation. From the 
lower limit of the primary formation nearly to the southern border of New Castle County, is a series 
of clays and marls of the Cretaceous and upper Jurassic formations. Between the lower or southern 
limit of the Cretaceous and the lower part of Kent County exists a series of beds of clay and sand 
which are of the tertiary (miocene) formation. The surface of the country im the lower part of Kent 
and the whole of Sussex County is much more level than that farther north. The aggregate thickness 
of all the formations south of the primary will probably not fall short of five hundred feet, and the gen- 
eral bearing of all the formations, like that of the primary, is nearly N. 50 E. 

The little State of Delaware furnishes us with a general description of the Geology of the whole 
Atlantic Coast, including considerable portions of the States of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, 
North and South Carolina and Georgia, comprising the primitive Archaean backbone or foundation 
formation, with the Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary extending eastward from it to the Ocean.

2. Hartford County, a few miles northwest of the Philadelphia, Wilmington&amp;Baltimore Rail- 
road yields a fine green serpentine in blocks, equal to verd-antique in splendor and polish, besides the 
common building sort. In the Jurassic beds on the same railroad, also on the Washington branch of 
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, vast beds of nodular carbonates of iron occur, rich in metal. 

3. The Woodstock, Ellicott&apos;s City and Port Deposit granites are superior of their kind. 

4. Bare Hills mineral region. It has chrome aud copper ores, asbestos, serpentine and magnesian 
rocks. 

5. The Western Maryland Railroad runs near copper mines, chrome, serpentine, talc, steatite, 
asbestos, carbonate of iron, and most beautiful marbles of every color, from black, dark red, salmon, 
etc., to pure white even statuary marble besides the breccias of every degree of size in their compo- 
nent pebbles or pieces, both round and angular. P. R. U. 

6. By Prof. William M. Fontaine, of Morgantown, West Virginia. 

7. Baltimore is located upon rocks of 1 b. Huronian and 1 c. Montalban ages and upon clays and 
sands which rest upon the eroded edges of both of these. The clays approach the neocomian in posi- 
tion, while the sands and drifts belong to various more recent horizons. P. R. U. 

8. The rocks of the eastern portion of the Azoic area in Maryland, as in Virginia, are granites, 
gneisses and hornblendic rocks. This belt extends to near Parr&apos;s Ridge, where it is succeeded by 
Argillites, with some metaraorphic limestone, probably of Montalban age. 

9. The Azoic area passes some distance to the west of the railroad from Baltimore to Washington, 
consequently this road runs chiefly in formations similar to those found at Baltimore. Washington has 
a geological position similar to that of Baltimore, but here the subjacent rocks are plainly similar in 
age to the Fredericksburg sandstones, and are probably Upper Jurassic. 

10. On the west side of the Monocacy River a belt of Mesozoic rocks occurs, extending to near 
the east base of the Catoctin Range. Along the west margin of this belt occurs the remarkable lime*

stone breccia called the Potomac Marble. This is well exposed near Point of Rocks. This Mesozoic 
belt is flanked immediately on the northeast and east by a belt of rather impure slaty limestone. 

11. The gorge at Harper&apos;s Ferry is cut through metamorphic rocks, of in part probably Huronian 
age. One and a half miles west of the station the Calciferous limestone appears. From this point, 83 
miles, to near North Mountain, 107 miles, a wide belt of Lower Silurian limestone occurs, with occa- 
sional bands of slate, embracing the rocks from the 3 a. Calciferous to and including the 4 c. Hudson 
River. These have never been separated in this&apos; region. The limestone predominates by far, and will 
be spoken of as the 2-4 Siluro-Cambrian. 

12. On the west side of this limestone belt, a great fault brings down in North Mountain the 
various Silurian and Devonian formations from the 5 a. Medina to the 13 a. Vespertine or No. X, 
which are to be seen in North Mountain and its immediate vicinity. 

13. From North Mountain to Cumberland a wide belt of highly disturbed strata occurs. Owing 
to the close compression of the folds in which the strata are thrown, many of the formations contained 
in this belt are always to be seen at any given locality, and hence when any formation is given for a 
station it must not be inferred that this alone occurs there. 

In this belt the following formations are to be found: The 5 a. Oneida, 5 b. Clinton, 7. Lower Hel- 
derberg, 8. Oriskany, 10. Hamilton, 11 a. Portage, 11 b. Chemung, 12. Catskill, and 13 a. Vespertine. 
These have never been clearly separated from each other. The hard sandstones, such as the 5 a. 
Oneida and 8. Oriskany, usually form the crests of the ridges, and the softer strata, more commonly 
the Hamilton, compose the valleys and foot hills. W. M. F. 

14. Cumberland, Md. Beautiful Oriskany sandstone fossils occur at the quarries in and about 
the city. Also Lower Helderberg and Clinton group fossils on Wills Creek below the town and Wills 
Gap. Also Fucoids of the Medina sandstone. R. P. WHITFELD. 

15. Patterson Creek. A short distance south of the road good Hamilton fossils are obtained on 
the Patterson farm. R. P. W. 

16. Frostburg. Coal plants of various kinds, Hamilton fossils as casts occur in and on the hills on 
the N. E. of the city, some of them very fine. R. P. W. 

*As it would seem advisable to give with some fullness what is known about the rocks near a large 
city like Baltimore, the following notes on the crystalline rocks in that neighborhood have been fur- 
nished for this book by Dr. George H. Williams, associate in Mineralogy at the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, in which he has brought to light some interesting points which are easy of access. J. M.

17. On the outskirts of the city on the right are the large Gneiss quarries of Tones Falls, which 
furnish Baltimore with much building and paving stone. They also produce many beautiful minerals, 
including the species Beaumontite (Heulandite) and Haydenite (Chabazite). The Gneiss is intersected 
by large veins of pegmatite containing fine specimens of microcline and frequently tourmaline, apatite, 
sphene, garnet, etc. 

18. Between Melvale and Woodberry a tongue of the Hypersthene-gabbro is crossed, and a contact 
between this rock and the gneiss well exposed. 

19. Just west of Rollins Station, but not visible from the railroad, is the lenticular mass of serpen- 
tine, known as the Bare Hills. It contains considerable chrpmite, which, however, is now no longer 
worked. Just south of the Bare Hills is a mine of chalcopyrite, occurring in the hornblende gneiss in 
connection with octahedral crystals of magnetite, and an interesting monoclinic variety of anthophyl- 
lite. G. H. W. 

20. This most interesting eruptive rock, locally known as &quot; Niggerhead,&quot; covers an area of about 
fifty square miles west and north-west of Baltimore. It is most admirably exposed at the above-named 
stations, especially at Mt. Hope, where a long cut reveals a section of it over 1,000 feet in length. In 
general appearance it strongly resembles the normal triassic trap, but is petrographically altogether 
different. It weathers to a dark vermilion soil, through which huge blocks of the fresh purple rock may- 
be seen protruding. The most interesting feature of this gabbro is the partial alteration which it has- 
suffered to a hornblendic rock which is generally massive, although sometimes schistose. This may be 
designated as Gabbro-Diorite, and has been formed by the paramorphosis of the pyroxene to hornblende 
without chemical change (see Am. Jour. Sci, Oct.. 1884). This change may be most ad vantageously 
studied at the Mt. Hope cutting. Just south of Highland Park the contact of the Gabbro and Schists 
may be seen with large dykes of the former rock alternating with the schists before the actual contact 
is reached. G. H. W. 

21. A few hundred yards above Orange Grove, on the Patapsco River, there is a most interesting- 
profile 250 feet in length exposed by the railroad excavations. Hornblende schists, dipping over 70 to 
the west, are cut by apparently eruptive granite. In the center a hu^e trunk, nearly 20 feet broad, 
emerges from the ground parallel to the dip of the schists, and from this two lateral arms are given off 
on each side which traverse the schists nearly at right angles to their bedding. The lower of these 
lateral arms on the west side, although only four feet broad at its origin, may be traced over 150 feet 
in a horizontal direction, and when it disappears is less than five inches in width. On the east side 
the arms are equally well marked, but are not exposed for so long a distance. Inclusions of the schist 
in the granite are very numerous; one in the main trunk is over 14 feet long. These dykes exhibit in 
an admirable manner the effect of the cooling surface on their structure, being always very coarse 
grained in the center but fine grained at the edge. Smaller dykes of granite are frequently exposed 
between Orange Grove and Avalon. G. H. W. 

22. The granite at Ellicott City is generally porphyritic; on the edges of the mass, however, this- 
structure disappears and the rock seems to pass gradually into Gneiss. G. H. W. 

23. The granite extensively quarried at Fox Rock and Granite P. O., a few miles north of Wood- 
stock, is of a very superior quality, closely resembling the &quot; Richmond Granite &quot; of Virginia. 

G. H. W. 

24. Loch Raven is a romantic spot on the Gunpowder River, which has been dammed as part of 
the Baltimore water supply. A conduit, cut through five miles of solid rock, leads the water to the 
city. From the station northward along the river the road exposes a fine section of quartzite and mica 
schist in contact with crystalline limestone. On the railroad are exposed quartz rocks and gneisses, 
with tourmaline and secondary mica developed on the cleavage planes. These are immediately over- 
laid by crystalline limestone, which is in turn succeeded by mica schists, often rich in garnet and fibrol- 
ite. and resembling the well known Philadelphia mica schists. At many points, however, the rocks on 
both sides of the limestone appear to be identical. At the upper contact is a huge dyke of very coarse 
grained granite. This is on the road just opposite the Water-works building on the dam.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS. 

As the descriptions of the formations given in the introductory part of this volume do not give a 
detailed account of the carboniferous rocks, and as West Virginia can lav claim to greater develop- 
ment of these beds than any other State, Professor I. C. White has kindly furnished the following 
resume of their structure and characteristics, and has extended it briefly to the other formations of 
that State, besides the Carboniferous. As these are the results of Professor White&apos;s very recent 
explorations as United States Geologist, they will be especially valuable to those who have not the 
time or opportunity to look through the official geological reports, and they may serve to correct 
many erroneous statements as to the geology of West Virginia which have obtained currency. 

J. M. 
2O. QUATERNARY. Cincinnati Ice Dam and flooded River epochs. 

The only Quaternary deposits found in West Virginia are those made along the Ohio River and 
its tributaries during the existence of the Glacial dam at Cincinnati, and those made along all the 
streams which drain the Allegheny Mountains plateau. (See Note 62.) The rounded boulders at high 
levels along the Potomac, Cheat and other rivers resemble glacial deposits, but no glacier ever existed 
in West Virginia,the deposits in question having been made during the &quot;Flooded River&quot; epoch which 
closed the glacial period, when the snows that had doubtless accumulated to a considerable thickness 
on the Allegheny plateau melting away filled the draining streams with water to a depth probably 
exceeding 100 feet. The entire area of West Virginia was elevated above sea level during the Appala- 
chian revolution, and has remained above the same ever since, hence none of the formations between 
the (15) Permian and (20) Quaternary are found in this State. 
15. Permian or Permo-Carbonlferous, Upper Barrens. 3 [XVI. Serai.]* 

The Permian beds, according to Fontaine and White, include all the stratified rocks in West 
Virginia above the horizon of the Waynesburg coal. The series has a maximum thickness of 1,600 
feet, and consists of red shales, sandstones and limestones, there being three or four thin coal beds 
in the lower half of the group, but none whatever in the upper. The beds are all apparently of fresh 
water origin, since the limestones contain no fossils except Spirorbis, Cypris, Estheria, and other 
bivalve crustaceans. The plant remains are principally Ferns of Permian type, including Callipteris 
ronferta, though Taeniopteris, Baiera and others recall Mesozoic forms. The formation enters the 
:r.m the southwest corner of Pennsylvania and stretches across it to the Great Kanawha River 
in a belt 30-50 miles wide.

in West Virginia is contained in Vol. P.P. of the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania, by Wm.

538 , AN AMERICAN GEOLOGICAL RAILWAY GUIDE. (W. VA.) 

14c. Upper Coal Measures, Monongahela Series. [XV. Serai.] 

In the northern portions of the State contains four coal beds in descending order, as follows : 

Waynesburg bed, merchantable coal , , 4-6 ft. 

Interval limestones, shales and sandstones 250 ft. 

Sewickley bed, merchantable 4-5 ft. 

Interval limestones and shales 65 ft. 

Redstone bed, worthless 3-4 ft. 

Interval limestones, shales and sandstones 40ft. 

Pittsburg bed, merchantable coal 6 ft. 



Total thickness 374ft. 

In Southern West Virginia, on Great Kanawha River, the group has undergone the following- 
changes: The Sewickley and Redstone coals are absent; the Waynesburg i.s thin and worthless: 
the group has lost all its limestones except one thin stratum ; it has also lost 100 feet of rock, inter- 
vals being reduced to 275 feet; red shales are abundant on the Kanawha River; there are none in 
these measures on the Monongahela; the Pittsburg coal maintains 5 ft.-6 ft. of merchantable coal,, 
but it is often absent entirely from wide areas, or only 1 ft.-2 ft. thick on others. 
14b. Barren Measures. [XIV. Serai.] 

Northern West Virginia shows the following structure : 

Shales, sandstones and limestones, sometimes including a thin coal 200 ft. 

Morgantown sandstone 25 ft. 

Elk Lick coal 0-4 ft. 

Shales 75ft. 

Green crinoidal limestone, very fossiliferous 2 ft. 

Coal 0-1 ft. 

Red and variegated marley shales 100 ft. 

Bakerstown coal 0-4 ft. 

Shales and sandstones 40 ft. 

Upper Mahoning sandstone, pebbly 50 ft. 

Brush Creek coal 0-3 ft. 

Lower Mahoning sandstone 75 ft. 

Shales 12 ft. 



Total 

On the Great Kanawha this group thickens up to 800 feet ; the green crinoidal limestone disap.- 
pears, but is exactly replaced strati-graphically by one of fresh water origin. The Brush Creek coaE 
attains important dimensions, and two new ones are introduced below it, while the series is termi- 
nated by the &quot; Black Flint,&quot; a marine deposit of dark gray, or blackish flint peculiar to the Kanawha 
Valley, and exhibiting every gradation between sandy shale and compact silex. 

The coals of the barrens are everywhere variable and uncertain. A bed may be present in good 
thickness on one farm, while on the adjoining land it may be absent entirely, or so impure as to- 
prove worthless. The Brush Creek seam is the persistent and important one. 
14b. L.ower Coal Measures. Allegheny River Series. [XIII. Seral.l 

These measures are 250 feet thick at the northern line of the State, and usually contain five coal, 
beds, in the following order : 
Upper Freeport Coal 

Interval. 50 ft 

Lower Freeport Coal 

Interval 75 ft. 

Middle Kittaning Coal- 
Interval 35ft. 

Lower Kittaning Coal- 
Interval 60 ft 

Clarion Coal 

Interval to top of XII 20 ft. 

The Upper Kittaning Coal, which is often present in Pennsylvania, seems to be absent in Northern 
ejmia, though it comes into the section on the Kanawha River. The Upper Freeport and. 



West Virgi 

Lower Kittaning are tne oniy ones 01 tnese nve tnat are valuable, since tfte owiers are usually too 
thin and slaty. The first is generally 4 ft-6 ft. thick and the latter 3 ft.-5 ft. This series gradually 
expands southwestward, and on the Kanawha River attains a maximum thickness of 1,100 ft, in which. 
its six productive coal beds are disposed somewhat as follows: 
Upper Freeport (&quot; Cannelton Lower&quot;) bed- 
Interval 100 ft. 

Lower Freeport (&quot; Coalburg &quot;) bed- 
Interval 75 ft 

Upper Kittaning (&quot; Winnifrede &quot;) bed- 
Interval 350ft 

Middle Kittaning (&quot; Cedar Grove &quot;) bed- 
Interval 115ft 

Lower Kittaning (&quot;Campbell Creek&quot;) bed- 
Interval 120 ft 

Clarion (Eagle) bed 

Interval to top of No. XII. in whioh two or three thin coal streaks occur 340 ft 

&apos;&quot; The six coal beds given above are never all workable in the same section ; in fact it is rare that 
more than two of them furnish valuable coal on the same property. The Lower Kittaning is probably 
the most persistent of the Kanawha coals. 



WEST VIRGINIA. 339 



14a. Pottsville conglomerate. New River Coal Series. [XII. Serai.] 

The N&lt;&gt;. XII. series has the following structure in Northern West Virginia, on Cheat R:ver: 
Massive pebbly sandstone, sometimes in two or more beds with intervening 
shales, the whole representing the Homewood and Cannoquenessing sand- 
stones of Pennsylvania ................................................................................. 160ft. 

oa j ............................................................................................ 1-2 ft. 

Black&apos;81ate7r.71VII^I!I!Zl,**J.. .................................................................... 10ft. 

Gray Sandstone to base of XII ........................................................................... 25 ft. 

South westward across the State this series thickens, even to a greater extent than XIII., and in 
the INew River (southward continuation of the Kanawha) region, attains a maximum of 1,300 ft., in 
which are three important coal beds in the following order, descending from top of XII. : 

Massive sandstones and conglomerate with a thin coal, 175 ft. below top ......... 400 ft. 

Nuttall Coal ................................................ - .................................................. 

Shales and massive sandstones ........................................................................ 250 ft. 



Shales and sandstones ...................................................................................... 100 ft. 

C Oa l _ ................................................................................................... 

Shales and massive sandstones to base of No. XII .................... .&quot;. ..................... 550 ft. 



Total ........................................................................................................... 1,300ft. 

These three beds are coking coals of the finest quality, and one of the two lower appears to be 
identical with the great ten-foot seam of the; Flat Top country. These coals are found of workable 
thickness only around the southern margin of the coal area, in a belt of country 20-30 miles wide, 
north from which they thin away to insignificant streaks. The Nuttall bed would correspond to the 
Quaker-town coal of Pennsylvania, and the other two would represent the Sharon and its &quot; rider.&quot; 
13. Sub-Carboniferous. 
13c. Mauch Chunk Shales. [XI. Umbral Shales.] 

On Cheat River consists of shales, green sandstones, and thin limestones, with iron ore next the 
top ; total thickness 300 ft., in which are only 10 ft.-15 ft. of red shale. On New River this series is 
not less than 2,000 ft. thick, consisting of red shales, green and gray sandstones, with an impure 
limestone at the top of the group. 
13b. Mountain or Greenbrier Limestone. [XL Umbral Limestone.] 

100 ft. -150 ft. thick in Monongalia Co., but increases to over 800 ft. in Greenbrier Co. Is absent 
entirely over a large portion of the Northern region of the State west from Chestnut Ridge. 
13a. Pocono Sandstone. [X. Vespertine Sandstone.] 

Hard gray current bedded sandstone and conglomerate, 500 ft.-600 ft. thick on Cheat River, and 
1,000 ft.-l,200 ft. in the Allegheny Mountains along B.&amp;O. R. R. No measurements have been made 
in southwestern portion of the State. 
9-12. Devonian. 
12. Catskill. [IX. Ponent.] 

Red shales, green and red sandstones, and an occasional conglomerate, 800 ft. thick at Rowles- 
burg, B.&amp;O. R. R., and 1,200 ft-1,500 ft. in Allegheny Mountains ; thins away to almost nothing west 
from Chestnut Ridge. 
11-12. Chemung-Catskill. [VIII. and IX. Ponent and Vergent in part.] 

Green and gray flaggy sandstones, fossiliferous, also containing occasional red beds, and a con- 
glomerate with flat pebbles, (1st Venango oil sand and gas rock at Washington and Murraysville), thick- 
ness near Keyser down to lowest red bed 800 to 1,000 ft. These rocks have sometimes been classed 
with the Catskill and again with the Chemung. In Penna. Geol. Report G 7 , p. 63, the desirability of 
the present classification is fully set forth.

4c. Hudson River Shales. [III. Matinal.] 

Dark brown shales and slates usually cleaved, probably 2,000 to 3,000 ft. thick on B.&amp;O. R. R., west 
from North Mountain ; no exact measurements have been made. 
4a. Shenandoah Valley Limestone. [II. and III. Matinal and Auroral.] 

Limestones of great thickness, and some of it very pure ; no trustworthy measurements have 
been made, but it is probably not less than 4,000 to 5,000 ft. thick along B.&amp;O. E. E. 
2b. Potsdam Sandstone. [I. Primal.] 

Found only in Blue Eidge at eastern line of State, where it consists of quartzites and slates, 
whose thickness has not been accucately determined, but it is probably not less than 2,000 to 
3,000 ft. 

1. Archaean. 

Ib. Huronian. Eocks of this age supposed to exist In the gap of the Potomac through the Blue 
Ridge at Harper&apos;s Ferry. 

3. Professor White thinks the geology of West Virginia can be best studied by beginning at 
Harper&apos;s Ferry, in Maryland, at the bottom of the series of formations. By this means the road 
between that place and Cumberland is given twice. J. M. 

4. The gorge at Harper&apos;s Ferry is cut through metamorphic rocks, of probably Huronian age. 
One and a half miles west of the station, a fault brings down the Potsdam and Calciferous rocks 
against the Azoic. From this point, 83 miles, to near North Mountain, 107 miles, a wide belt of 
Lower Silurian limestone occurs, with occasional bands of slate, embracing the rocks from the 3 a. 
Calciferous to and including the 4 c. Hudson Eiver. These have never been separated in this region. 
The limestone predominates by far, and will be spoken of as the 2-4. Siluro-Cambrian. (F). 

5. Martinsburg. Splendid quarries in No. II. limestone here. One mile east from Martinsburg 
a syncline catches the Hudson River slate and the limestone goes under for two or three miles, then 
reappears, and again goes under to come up once more near Kerneysville. These crumples near the 
centre of the valley are the northeastern extension of the great trough which holds Massanutten 
Mountain, 50 miles south from Martinsburg. 

6. North Mountain. On the west side of this limestone belt a great fault brings down in North 
Mountain the various Silurian and |Devonian formations, from the 5 a. Medina to the 13 a. Vesper- 
tine or No. X., which are to be seen in North Mountain and its immediate vicinity. (F). 

7. Sir John&apos;s Run. From this point westward to Cumberland the rocks are thrown into a serais 
of great arches, whose corresponding troughs catch the Pocono beds in the tops of the mountains, and 
bring up the Lower Helderberg limestone on the anticlinals, so that frequently several formations 
may be seen near one station. (F). 

8. Doe Gully. Fine exposures of Catskill rocks in the approaches to the tunnel, which cutting 
through them parallel to the strike, permits the highly inclined beds to slide down into the cuts 
from a long distance up the sloping side. 

9. Green Spring Run. The valley here is a syncline of Genesee, Hamilton and Marcellus rocks, 
enclosed on either side by anticlinal ridges of Oriskany sandstone, making Mill Creek Mountain 
on the east and Patterson&apos;s Creek Mountain on the west. 

10. Patterson&apos;s Creek. Another synclinal valley of Hamilton beds, bordered east and west by 
anticlinal ridges of Oriskany. Under the arch of the eastern one the Lower Helderberg limestone 
is brought above water level and quarried on the Maryland side of Potomac. 

11. Cumberland. Good geological headquarters. The great Will&apos;s Creek Mountain anticlinal 
just east from the city, brings up the Red Medina, spanned by a splendid arch of White Medina, 
through which the creek has carved a narrow canon, in which there is barely room for the two R. R&apos;s 
and the National turnpike. The Clinton, L. Helderberg, Oriskany and Hamilton all exposed near 
city. The low mountain which begins on the Virginia side at Cumberland, and trends away to the 
Bouthwest, is made by the massive Oriskany sandstone and called Knobby or &quot; Knobley.&quot; 

12. Keyser. Splendid ground for geologists. The Potomac river turns squarely around to the 
northeast on leaving Cumberland and the R. R. follows this direction almost parallel to the strike of 
the rocks, and hence along the crest and sides of the great Will&apos;s Creek Arcn, which the river has 
worn down and converted into a valley from Cumberland to Keyser, with Knobley Mountain (Oriskany) 
on the south, and Dan&apos;s Mountain (Pocono and No. XII.) on the north, from the highest peak of which, 
opposite Brady&apos;s Mill, is one of the grandest views in all the Appalachian region. Queen&apos;s point, 
opposite Keyser, is an arch of Oriskany, under which comes fine exposures of L. Helderberg, both

very fossil iferous. The R. R. cut at Bull Neck, just below Keyser, is through a sharp syncline of 
Oriskany. The L. H. limestone, Salina, Clinton and White Medina, all finely exposed along Lime- 
stone run near town; while the Hamilton, Chemung, Catskill, Pocono, Mauch Chunk and Pottsville 
conglomerate come down in succession along the R. R. between Keyser and Piedmont. 

13. Deer Park. West of Altamont the railroad continues on a broad, undulating plateau, the 
Ravage and Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania having here coalesced into one. This remarkable 
flut mountain top, from 2,400 to 2,600 feet in height above tide, has always attracted much atten- 
tion from the comparative softness of the outlines, giving the park-like character to its topog- 
raphy. (F.) 

14. Roiclesburg. Here the R. R. starts up another steep grade to the crest of Laurel ridge, and 
the view to the right (in going west) down the course of Cheat, is the grandest of all the B.&amp;O. R. R. 
scenery. The geological picture is no less interesting, since the road bed is almost a continuous 
ro.&apos;k-&apos;--ut for 5 miles, thus giving a nearly clean exposure of the column of rocks from the top of the 
Chemung up through 700 ft. of Catskill, 566 ft. of Pocono, 712 ft. of Mauch Chunk, 368 ft. of Pottsville 

n-nite, 310 ft. of Lower Coal Measures, and 200 ft. of the Barrens (No. XIV). 

15. Suck Horn Run. All of these viaducts cross wild gorges 75 ft.-100 ft. deep, and at the Gray 
Run gorge the cars are apparently directly over Cheat River, 200 ft. below. 

16. W. Portal Kingwood Tunnel. Kingwood Tunnel is 4,132 ft. long and passes through Laurel 
Hill, the anticlinal axis of which crosses the R. R. somewhere near the eastern end of the tunnel, 
since the U. Freeport coal has there an elevation of 1,865 ft. A. T. and dips eastward, while at the 
western portal the same coal is 1,805 ft. A. T. and dipping rapidly westward. The summit of the 
mountain is made Vy 200 ft. of Mahoming sandstone. 

17. East Portal Murray&apos;s Tunnel. U Freeport coal here 3% ft.-4V ft. thick, and extensively 
coked at Austin mines 20 ft. under R. R. track, just west from Murray&apos;s Tunnel. 

18. Newburg. A small area (3&lt;(0-400 acres) of the Pittsburg coal iscaughtin the summit of the hills 
here near the centre of the trough between Laurel Hill and Chestnut Ridge anticlinals. The Pitts- 
burg&lt;val has an elevation of 500 ft. above R. R. and Is transported to the latter over a long incline. 
A shaft has recently been sunk near the foot of the incline which passed through the U. Freeport 
coal, 4 ft. thick at 169 ft., and the Lower Kittaning bed, 7 ft. thick at 3-59 ft. 

19. Three Fork Creek Bridge. Three miles up Three Fork Creek is Irondale Furnace where 
native ore (from 150 ft. above U. Freeport coal) is principally used, and theU. Freeportcoal furnishes 
the coke. A branch R. R. connects it with B.&amp;O. at mouth of Three Fork. 

20. Valley River Falls. The anticlinal axis of Chestnut Ridge crosses the river here and brings 
up th- conglomerate rocks of No. XII. to 1.50 ft. above water level, over which the stream descends 
in a series of wild cascades. The hills are capped by the Mahoming sandstone, thus exposing all of 
JJo. Xlil. 

21. Fairmont. The Pittsburg coal comes about 75 ft. above the track here and Is extensively 
mined and shipped east for gas and steam purposes.

22. Farmington. The Waynesburg bed is mined here about 150 ft. above track, the Pittsburg 
being more than 200 ft. under water level. 

23. Mannington. The Waynesburg coal, or highest number of the Carboniferous proper, goes 
under the R. R. track 2% miles east from Mannington, and from there to near the Ohio river the 
rocks belong to the Permian or Permo-Carboniferous series, the No. XVI. of Rogers. The Washing- 
ton coal is 75 ft.-lOO ft. above track at Mannington. 

24. Burton. In the region between here and Bellton are to be found the highest rocks of the 
Permian series, some of the summits attaining an elevation of 1,200 ft.-l,500 ft. above the Waynesburg 
coal. 

25. West Portal Board Tree Funnel. Ninevah coal, the uppermost small bed of the Permian 
series, 50 ft. over track here. 

26. Belton. A fine locality for Permian exposures in the steep hills, which rise GOO ft. to 700 ft. 
above water level. A hole bored for oil a short distance above Bellton, passed through the Waynes- 
burg coal at 400 ft. below creek level. 

27. Moundsville. The Pittsburg coal underlies the Ohio river about, 90 ft. at Moundsville, and is 
mined by shafts. The Waynesburg bed is 170 ft. above the river, but impure, and only 2% ft.-3 ft. 
thick. 

28. Wheeling. The Pittsburg coal is about 100 ft. above river here, and fine exposures of the 
entire Upper Coal Measures (260 ft. thick), and the lower portion of Permian may be seen in the steep 
hills around Wheeling. 

29. Flemington. Here the Lower Coals and Lower Barren Measures are shown, with a small 
remnant of the Pittsburg bed in the tops of the hills, it being the seam worked there. (F). 

At this station is the eastern outcrop of the Pittsburg coal bed, west from the anticlinal of Laurel 
Hill (Chestnut Ridge of Pennsylvania). From this locality the coal and the railroad level constantly 
approach, until at Wolf&apos;s Summit, a little west from Wilsonburg, the coal is under the track. (S.&amp;F.) 

30. Clarksburg. Pittsburg coal extensively mined here and westward to Wilsonburg. It is also 
coked and shipped to Chicago and elsewhere for purposes other than the manufacture of iron. 

31. Wilsonburg. Just before reaching Wolfs Summit, the Pittsburg coal bed is at the railroad 
level, and is worked near the track at the Summit. The Redstone coal bed is seen two inches thick 
in the Summit cut. Between the Summit and the Brandy Gap Tunnel the Waynesburg coal bed is 
seen and is worked just south from the railroad, the opening being visible from the track. At the 
west end of the tunnel the Washington coal bed is exposed above the track. This is in the Upper 

(Barren Measures. (S). 

32. West Union. The Waynesburg coal is mined to a small extent here and eastward beyond 
Smithton, but is thin (2 ft.-4 ft&quot;) and impure. The roof shales contain numerous finely preserved 
fossil plants at West Union. 

33. Ellenboro. Prof. Stevenson is now inclined to believe that what he has described in this 
region as faults are only very sharp anticlinal axes, and that what is known as the &quot; Oil Break &quot; is 
Himply a great anticlinal arch, and in this view Prof. White coincides, though he has made no special 
investigation of the question. The oil obtained at Volcano and other localities in this region comes 
from the Pottsville conglomerate, according to Stevenson. 

34. Petroleum. About one-fifth of a mile east of this station, a fault crosses the railroad, which 
brings up the Lower Barren Series against the Upper Barren Series. Thence, from Ellenboro to 
within a short distance of Petroleum station, the rocks are nearly horizontal, and the Upper freeport 
coal bed is exposed in several of the cuts. But, near Petroleum, there is a most remarkable upheaval,

* Chesapeake&amp;Ohio Railroad. Prof. Wm. B. Rogers&apos; account of the geology of this road in Vir* 
ginia and in West Virginia, as given in the first edition, is re-produced in the chapter on Virginia; 
but since its publication the country has been greatly developed and studied, and Prof. White has 
therefore prepared a more extended and minute description of the portion of that road in West 

Virginia. _ 

which has brought up the lower coals, the strata suddenly rising within a few yards to an angle of 80 
degrees. Just west of Laurel Fork Junction the rocks dip down again, the conditions being here on 
the west side similar to those at Petroleum on the east. After passing the first cut west from the sta- 
tion, the dip is suddenly reduced from 50 degrees to nearly horizontal. This forms the so-called &quot; Oil 
Break,&quot;as all the productive oil wells are found along the line of this belt. This belt is about one and 
a half miles wide, running in a direction a little east of north and gradually flattening out toward each 
extremity, and forms one of the most remarkable geological features in this State. This curious 
disturbance is well worth a visit. Near it, a few miles off by a branch road from Cairo, is the vertical 
chasm, 4 feet wide, which was filled with the mineral Grahamite, now worked out. There is a fault 
at Kanawha, forming the western boundery of the disturbed region, as that at Ellenboro is the 
eastern. (S.&amp;F.) 

35. Parkersburg. The Washington coal, about 100 ft. above the base of the Permian series, is 
found at low water of the Ohio here, while the horizon of the Pittsburg bed would be about 360 ft 
under the river, but it is altogether probable that the Pittsburg has here thinned away, since borings 
give no trace of it, and at Burning Springs where the &quot; Oil Break &quot; anticlinal brings up its horizon, 
the coal is absent. 

86. Carbon. Pittsburg coal mined here by shaft 65 ft. deep. 

37. Roney&apos;s Point. Waynesburg coal mined locally, only 2% ft.-3 ft. thick, and impure. 

38. Claysville. Washington coal at track level, 1% miles west from borough. Claysv

39. Washington. The Harvey, Hoff and Hess gas wells supply the town with fuel ; these three 
gas wells all on a line along the crest of the Washington anticlinal, were so located on scientific 
grounds by Prof. I. C. White. The GantzWell, one mile southeast from the anticlinal obtained oil 
from the same sand (1st Venango) that the others get gas from. The Gantz Well struck the sand at 
2,200 ft., passing through Pittsburg coal at 350 ft., while the Hess well got gas at 2,068 ft., passing 
the same coal at 250 ft. 

40. Atteghanu Tunnel. The line between Virginia and West Virginia is crossed near center of 
tunnel through the Alleghany Mountain, the backbone of which is the Pocono sandstone. 

41. White Sulphur. A well known summer resort, famed for the curative properties of its 
mineral water, which issues from the Oriskany sandstone in a large spring, Sowing 75 to 100 gallons 
per minule. 

42. Ronceverte. The railroad passes through the Pocono sandstone (X.) at Louisa tunnel, between 
Ronceverte and Caldwell, and then enters a long stretch of No. XI. limestone and shales along the 
Greenbrier River. The limestone is over 800 ft. thick, and forms the rich belt of blue grass country, 
which extends through Monroe, Greenbrier and Pocahontas counties. In the Pocono rocks at 
Louiaa tunnel many fossil plants may be found. 

43. Don. Near Don is the Big Bend tunnel, 6,080 ft. long, through No. XI. red shale, which cuts 
off several miles of meanders in the Greenbrier river. 

44. Hinton. Junction of Greenbrier with New River. Here the railroad enters the caflon of the 
latter stream, a great gorge cut down 1,000 to 1,500 ft. below the tops of the bounding mountains, and 
in which the railroad runs for nearly 60 miles through some of the wildest scenery on the continent. 

46. New Richmond. A splendid sandstone for building purposes crops out in the No. XI. sandy 
beds above the railroad here, and the West Virginia block for the Washington monument was quar- 
ried from the same. In the vicinity of Ronceverte and Alderson these sandy beds of XI. seem to be 
almost unrepresented, for the limestone there extends nearly up to the base of No. XII.; but as we 
enter the New River region a great mass of red shales, green and gray sandstones, etc., 1,500 to 2,000 
ft. thick, wedges in between the main Greenbrier limestone below and 30 to 40 ft. of impure fossilif- 
erous limestone at top, which immediately underlies the Pottsville (XII.) conglomerate. This upper 
limestone along New River holds the same fossils as an impure limestone in Monongalia County, 
which is separated from the main sub-carboniferous limestone by 50 ft, of sandstones and red shales.

and the two are very probably identical, though the intervening rocks have increased 30 fold in 
thickness on New River. 

46. Quinnimont. The No. XII., or New River coal series, comes into the tops of the adjoining 
mo&apos;untains here, and one of its coal beds, which comes 600 ft. above the base of XII., has been mined 
and coked for use in the iron furnace situated at Quinnimont. It makes a splendid coke, as does each 
of the three workable beds in No. XII. The elevation of the Quinnimont bed is 1,050 ft. above railroad. 

47. McKendree. About half way between this station and Prince, the-upper or Chester limestone 
mentioned in Note 45 comes down to track level, and presents a fine opportunity for collecting sub- 
carbo liferous (Chester) fossils. 

48. Stone Cliff. Mines in Fire Creek and Nuttall coals, the former at 650 ft. above river, the lat- 
ter at 950 ft. 

49. Fire Creek. The Fire Creek coal here mined at 700 ft. above railroad, steepest incline on river. 

50. Sewell. All of the three New River coals may be seen here. The Nuttall bed in the tops of 
the mountains, and the Quinnimont and Fire Creek below. These coals are of excellent coking 
varieties and very pure. 

51. Nuttall. Nuttall coal, 400 ft. under top of XII. and 600 ft. above railroad, mined here. 
Uppermost great cliff rock of XII. seen capping the mountain here, from which the scenery is very 
grand. 

52. Hawk&apos;s Nest. The Hawk&apos;s Nest cliff is on right bank of river, one mile below station, and 
here the upper members of XII. rise almost vertically from the bed of the river to 500 ft. above the 
same. The view from it is well worth a visit. The Anstead coal mines are in Gauley Mountain, four 
miles distant, and 855 ft. above C.&amp;O. R. R. A narrow-gauge railroad leads out to them. The 
Lower Kittanning coal is the one mined. Nuttall coal is only 75 ft. above track at Hawk&apos;s Nest, and 
2 ft. 8 in. thick. 

53. Kanawha Falls. The falls are a series of cascades aggregating about 20 ft. in height over the 
hard current-bedded upper portion of the Homewood sandstone. 

54. Cannelton. A good locality to study the lower coal measure series. The Clarion (Eagle) 
is just below track level. The Lower Kittanning bed is 105 ft. above, and extensively mined for gas 
coal, while on the north side here the U. Freeport coal may be seen at 750 ft. above river changed to 
a splendid cannel. From Mt. Carbon to near Charleston the track runs in No. XIII. beds, and coal 
openings are numerous on both sides of river. A general section of these measures is given in 
another connection. 

55. Paint Creek. Paint Creek axis crosses here, and a railroad extends up Paint Creek for 10 
miles to coal mines. 

56. Blacksburg. Splendid example of erosion during coal measure times in cuts just above 
Blacksburg. 

57. Coalburg. Splendid geological headquarters for seeing Coalburg, Cedar Grove and Brush 
Creek coals, and collecting fossil plants in roof of Lower Kittanning and Cedar Grove beds in Wat- 
son&apos;s Hollow, North Coalburg. 

58. Winnifrede Junction. A railroad leads up Field&apos;s Creek seven miles to Winnifrede coal mines, 
the typical locality of Winnifrede bed (Upper Kittanning). On the other side of the river directly 
opposite, and in plain sight from the cars, is the mine of the Macfarlane Coal Company, in the Win* 
mfrede bed, one of the best mines along the Kanawha, furnishing a very pure coal of splint and 
bituminous mixed, and in quality unsurpassed for domestic and steam purposes. 

59. Maiden. Cross to opposite side and examine extensive mines on Campbell&apos;s Creek (Lower 
Kittanning) coal, also salt works, the water being derived from base of XII. 

60. Charleston. Good headquarters for studying barrens (XIV.). Three miniature faults in

cuts of railroad, one Jmile above station, where U. Freeport coal and overlying &quot;Black Flint&quot; may 
also be examined. Great deposit of rounded pebbles and stones at junction of Elk and Kanawha 
here, finely exposed along cemetery road and extending to 385 ft. above river, the upper limit of the 
glacial dam-lake in which the deposit was made. From Charleston to Huntingdon the railroad run* 
in No. XIV., or the Barren Coal Measures. 

61. SpringhUl. Great terrace of rounded boulders extend up over 200 ft. above river, just below 
mouth of Davis Creek, up which a railroad extends 15 miles to coal and Black Band iron ore mines. 

62. -Scary. Here the railroad leaves the Kanawha River following up Scary Creek, which lead* 
out into an old valley (Teazes), at Scott, four miles distant. This singular valley, one mile wide and 
200 ft. above the Kanawha River, bounded on either side by hills 200 feet higher, and extending 
through to the Guyandot River, which finally debouches into the Ohio, was once occupied by an arm 
of the Kanawha River, when the great ice dam at Cincinnati during glacial times backed the waters 
of the Ohio and its tributaries to a height of 500 to 600 ft. above present low water at Cincinnati. 
This hypothetical dam of Prof. G. F. Wright is demonstrated beyond any doubt by the great beds of 
clay, gravel, boulders and other trash which cover Teazes Valley to a great depth all along its course, 
except where subsequent erosion has removed them. When the ice dam melted away at Cincinnati, 
the water that had previously filled this valley was withdrawn, passing down to the Ohio by its for- 
mt-r and present route, the Kanawha, thus leaving the ancient valley high and dry, though littered 
up with &quot; Black Flint,&quot; pieces of cannel coal, quartzite, sandstone and other rocks that testify to- 
their Kanawha and New River origin. 

The traveler should also notice the remarkably level character of the Kanawha Valley flat?, on 
which the railroads are built, as shown by the altitudes given from Point Pleasant to Charleston, on 
the Ohio Central Railroad, and above Charleston, on the Chesapeake A Ohio Railroad. Another 
important fact is that the deposit which fills this valley is true loess, a lacustrine deposit similar to 
that on the Mississippi and Missouri River and elsewhere.- J. M. 

63. Scott. An excellent locality to study the ice dam lake deposits in a deep cut through them 
just east from station. The rounded boulders extend up to 750 ft. above tide here. 

64. Ona. Lake deposits abundant. 

G5. Huntingdon. Mahoning sandstone makes cliffs along the hills from here to the State line- 
al Big Sandy River. 

66. Sattes. An interesting group of mounds, the work of the Mound-builders, occurs in the wide 
bottoms toward the river, half way between this station and Charleston. 

67. Poea. The Pittsburg coal is extensively mined in this vicinity by the Marmet Mining Co. 
The coal is absent in the immediate river hills, but comes in about one mile back. The horizon of 
this coal emerges from the bed of the Kanawha, between Buffalo and Red House, being mined at

Oak Ridge, four miles below Red House, where it is 20 ft. above river level. Its height is 175 ft. at 
Poca, and on up the river is carried into the air along the valley. 

68. Red House. The great cliff near the hill top is the Waynesburg sandstone. 

69. Grimm&apos;s. Here the Waynesburg coal has been opened 190 ft. above river level, where it is 
-slaty, worthless, and only 3 ft. thick. A well, bored in search of the Pittsburg coal, found only a trace 
of that bed at 80 ft. under river. 

70. Point Pleasant. The Pittsburg coal is here about 75 ft. above the Ohio River, but only \% ft. 
-2 ft. thick. The Waynesburg sandstone at the base of the Permian, or No. XVI. of Rodgers, makes 
cliffs near the summit of the hills. 

71. Wellsburg. In this town, and the immediate vicinity, many strong gas wells have been 
.struck at a depth of 1,300 ft. below the Ohio river. The gas is utilized for bothTieat and light in the 
town, and also supplies the glass and other manufactories. The geological position of the gas sand 
is about 1,650 ft. under the Pittsburg coal, and is possibly identical with the Murraysville sand. A 
shaft has also been sunk to the same coal that is mined at Steubenville, which Prof. Orton identifies 
with the Lower Freeport, and which is here about 210 ft. under the railroad. 

72. The Grafton&amp;Greenbrier is a narrow-eauee railroad, which follows the Tvgart&apos;s Valley River 

irrens, No. XIV., 



southward from Grafton to Philippi, its track running for about six miles in the 

then passing down through the Lower Coal Measures and into No. XII. three or four miles in the 

vicinity of Moatsville, and emerging at the horizon of the Upper Freeport coal at Philippi. 

73. Pittsburg coal is mined and shipped from this point. 

74. Pittsburg coal in tops of the hills about 300 ft. above track. 

75. The Mahoning sandstone crops out along west fork of Monongahela River here, according to 
Prof. Stevenson. The State Insane Asylum, built of Barren Measures sandstone, is located at Weston. 

76. This is a continuation of the Clarksburg&amp;Weston Narrow Gauge Railroad. 

77. The Pittsburg coal is 40 to 50 ft. under the track here. 

78. The Pittsburg coal is mined in the hills around Buckhannon, probably 100 ft. to 150 ft. above 
the depot. It is 4 ft. to 4% ft. thick. 

79. By Mr. James Parsons, C. and M. E., Piedmont, W. Va. 

80. From Piedmont to within one mile of Gorman the road runs at the base of the Piedmont 
sandstone, the north branch of the Potomac having cut its circuitous course through that stone and 
bedded itself upon the upper series of the conglomerate. The cliffs and bluffs formed by that stone 
tower high above the road on both sides, and the scenery becomes grand, beautiful and interesting.

81. At Gorman the road begins, geologically, to rise up through the Lower Coal Measures in a red 
thole, as observed also by Prof. I. C. White, a thing unheard of or unreported in the Lower Coal 
Measures, and at Bayard it has passed through the Kittanning and Freeport coals to the base of the 
Lower Barren Measures. 

82. From Camden to Fairfax it still continues to rise, until by the time it reaches the summit at 
the latter place it rests upon the top of the Lower Barren Measures and at the base of the Upper 
Coal Measures. 

83. From Fairfax to Thomas it gradually descends through the same barren measures and 
down until it reaches the bottom of the Freeport. 

84. From Thomas to Davis it still continues to descend through the Lower Coal Measures until 
it reaches the Piedmont or Homewood sandstone at the latter place. 

85. Davis is situated in the renowned valley of Canaan on the Black Water, at its junction with 
Beaver. Here the bottoms are broad, and stand on an elevation of 3,072 feet above tide water, while 
the plateaus running back both ways rise still higher to an elevation of 3,170 feet. Davis, standing 
upon this bottom and plateau, is destined to become the frequent resort, not only of the seeker after 
pleasure, but of the scientific traveler, for from this point a great and grand panorama presents itself. 

The Plane rises about 600 feet, passing up through the Lower Coal Measures and the Lower Barren 
Measures to the base of the Upper Coal Measures. Here the Pittsburg seam is opened and worked 
in several places at and near Elk Garden. This seam is 14 feet thick and of the finest quality. 

86. The branch road from Shaw to Mineville passes up through the Piedmont or Homewood 
sandstone to the Kittanning coal, which crops out of the mountains at the foot of the plane. 

The notes signed &quot; F.&quot; are by Prof. Wm. M. Fontaine, and those signed &quot; 8.&quot; .by Prof. J. J. Steven- 
eon, taken from the first edition. 

The altitudes for West Virginia have been all carefully collected, from .original sources, by Prof- 
L C. White; many of them are nere published for the first time.

* Since the stereotypes were made of the foregoing pages&apos;of this chapter, (which had been edited 
by my father), Prof. White has furnished these additional lines and surveys. J. R. M. 

87. Errata in Note 45. The statement in Note 45 with reference to the thinning away of No. 
XII. red beds in vicinity of Alderson, etc., was made upon information which I considered reliable 
at the time, but a subsequent personal examination shows that what was taken for the Pottsville 
conglomerate is simply a massive, white pebbly sandstone in the No. XI. shales and that instead oi 
having thinned away, these shales are here thicker than anywhere else in the state, approaching 
2,500 feet and holding two immense white conglomerates, along with the red beds and impure lime- 
stones. I. C. W. 

The casting of the plate in which Note 45 occurs prevented the making of this correction in it$ 
proper place. J. R. M. &apos; 

88. Fairmount. The levels are brought from Fairmount on main line of B.&amp;O. by Major 
Whiting of the B.&amp;O. engineer corps. The elevation here gives 779 feet for low water at Morgan- 
town, but the river survey from Pittsburgh makes it 786 feet. See Note 21. 

89. Rievesville. Sewickley coal crops out along railroad cuts. 

90. Little Falls. Upper Freeport coal in cuts. Rapids in river made by Upper Freeport sand- 
stone. 

91. Offington. Mahoning s. s. makes great cliffs here known as &quot;Raven Rocks.&quot; 

92. Morgantown. Upper Freeport coal 75 feet under river. Pittsburgh coal 440 feet above same 
level. Fine show of terrace deposits extending to 275 feet above river. Good locality for fossils in 
crinoidal limestone. Cheat river gorge nine miles distant. Grand view from crest of Chestnut Ridge. 
Subcarboniferous fossils under great arch below. 

93. Camdensburg. The Pittsburgh coal dips under the river about two and a half miles above 
Fairmount to about 50 feet below the same, but comes up just below Camdensburg and is soon 25 to 
30 feet above water. Extensive coking works of ex-Senator Camden and others, 250 ovens. Coal 9 
to 10 feet thick. This bed is never less than 8 feet thick between Fairmount and Clarksburg, and 
is of excellent quality for fuel, gas and coke. This road passes through one of the finest coal fields 
in the world, which must in the near future replace the Counellsville field. 

94. Ten Mile. Upper Freeport coal in hills here and at the level of the track four miles belowy 
near mouth of Grassy Run, where it is only 3 to 4 feet thick, but roofed with 12 feet of cannel slate. 

95. Murraysville. The Waynesburg sandstone is frequently seen between Parkersburg and 
Letout Falls, sometimes a great cliff as at Murraysville; again its top is just seen in the bed of the 
Ohio. At Letout it rises from the river to the northwest and makes the rapids in the river. Below 
here it forms long lines of cliffs near the summits nearly to Guyandotte. 

96. Graham. Pittsburgh coal mined on the other side of the river by shaft 170 feet deep. Coal 
about 5 feet thick and dips rapidly southeast toward the center of the Appalachian basin. 

97. Hartford. Hartford, Mason City, Clifton and the town of Pomeroy on the Ohio side are 
celebrated for the manufacture of salt and bromine. Salt bearing stratum reached by borings at 
about 1,150 feet under the Pittsburgh coal. It appears to be the top portion of the Pocono, (No. X.) 
sandstone and the same as the Mt. Morris oil rock (&quot;Big Injun.&quot;)

98. Camden. Pittsburgh coal, 4 to 5 feet thick, mined here. It thins away down the river to 18 
20 inches at Point Pleasant. Occasionally, as at Mercer&apos;s Bottom, it thickens to 4 or five feet. 

that it thins again to a few inches and not mined until near Huntington, where it is 3 to 4 feet. 

99. Qlenwood. Here recently an attempt was made to sell lands as containing tin ore. The 
reputed tin i* a brecciated lime.-tone 40 to 60 feet below the Pittsburgh coal and on analysis proved 
not to contain a trace of tin. Another &quot;tin syndicate&quot; explored this same stratum for that metal ou 
the Little Kanawha, nine miles above Grantsville. 

&apos; 100. Three Forks Reedy. The &quot;Ridge Limestone&quot; near the summits of the hills over a large 
portion of Jackson county is often 10 to 20 feet thick, and is probably the Ninevah Limestone of 
Pennsylvania, the X. of Stevenson&apos;s Green county series. 

I 101. Spencer. The Burning Springs or Volcano anticlinal passes along the valley of Spring 
|eek, bringing the Barren Measures to the surface. Pittsburgh coal is absent or but feebly repre- 
d in this portion of the state and especially along the line of the Volcano anticlinal everywhere. 
102. Point Look Out. Grandest scenery in the Appalachian Mountains. The Black Fork of the 
cuts a canon 1,500 feet deep through the Back Bone Mountain range, which is capped by the 
sville Conglomerate. The railroad grade down this gorge is 160 feet to the mile and it &quot;runs 
a rock shelf 300 to 400 feet above the river, which has a fall of 100 feet to the mile. The New 
coals are exposed along the railroad grade, both the Nuttall (2% feet thick) and Quinnemont 
being recognizable. The Quinnemont and Five Creek beds are split into a half dozen thin 
srs. The whole Pottsville Conglomerate series is here over 700 feet thick.

103. Elkins. The Tygarts valley in which the town is situated, is? geologically a great arch, or 
rather two anticlinal axis which have come nearly together. These are the anticlmals which cross 
the B.&amp;O. R. R. at Terra Alta and Mountain Lake Park respectively, having there a trough 
between them deep enough to catch the Lower Coal Measures.but here at Elkins the axes are less 
than a mile apart and the trough holds only the basal beds of the Chemung. On one side (west) of 
this double arch at Elkins. the Rich Big Laurel Mt. rises to 3,500 feet above the sea, and on the 
other (east) Cheat Mt. attains a greater height, while both are crowned with the Pottsville Conglom- 
erate, thus rendering the wide valley between, one of the most beautiful and picturesque in the 
country. 

104. Additon. County seat of Webster county. On the summit of an anticlinal axis, which, 
brings the top of the Greenbriar Limestone 40 feet above water level and exposes 800 feet of the Mauch 
Chunk Red Shales between the top of the limestone and the base of the Pottsville Conglomerate in. 
the summit of the Mountain above. Near the crest of this arch at Addisona hole was once bored 
for oil many years ago, but at about 100 feet a strong stream of salt and sulphur water was struck^ 
which still continues to flow and has attained much celebrity as a mineral water for medicinal pur- 
poses, especially for kidney troubles Where the Gauley Turnpike crosses McGuires Gap, opposite 
Addison, a coal bed 2% to 3 feet thick has been mined only 20 feet above the Mauch Chunk red beds. 

105. Near here on Land Run ia the out crop of a coal bed 7 feet thick, of poor quality and ifc 
would seem to come at the same horizon as the PocahonUs or No III. bed of the Flat Top region. 

106. Capt. Joseph Parsons, chief engineer of the W. Va. C. R. R. who has kindly furnished all 
the elevations on that railroad and its surveys, states that the Lower Kittanning coal passes under 
Stony river about three and a half miles above its mouth and reappears at nine miles up. The 
center of the trough is near where the northwestern pike crosses Stony river, and here the Pitts- 
burgh coal is&apos;in the summits of the hills just north from the river. This is the northern end of the 
Elk Garden Pittsburgh coal basin, since northward from here that coal misses the hills by only 60 
to 100 fee* for twenty miles, till it is caught in the Fairfax summit on the Cheat-Potomac Divide. 

107. There is a large area of the lower Kittanning coal from here on down the river for four 
miles and it has a thickness.of eight feet with its customary partings. It is forty feet above water 

108. Half way between Roaring creek and Elkins the Tygarts Valley river cuts squarely through 
the great Rich-Laurel Mt. uplift; and exposes a splendid section from the Hamilton up to the Lower 
Coal Measures. Along and in the vicinity of Roaring creek is a large field of the Upper Freeport 
coal where the bed has a thickness of 8 to 10 feet. The Freport sandstone is very massive and 
pebbly along the lower part of Roaring creek and makes the numerous falls. 

109. Queen&apos;s Shoals. A few miles above here the river bends southward and the Upper Freeport 
coal comes above water level, and keeps above the same till the stream turns northwestward above 
Clay C. H. There is a fine area of this coal on Big and Little Sycamore creeks. With this excep- 
tion only the Barren Measures crop out along Elk between Sutton and its mouth, a distance of 100 
miles, and as these beds have a greater thickness (800&apos;) here than anywhere else in the country, I 
have termed them the Elk River series. 

110. Sutton. The Mahoning coal (about 100 feet above the base of the Barrens) crops 30 to 40 
feet above river level and has been mined to a small extent, while at Frametown 16 miles below, the 
Pittsburgh coal is in the summits of the hills, 500 feet above the river and 6 to 7 feet thick. 

111. From the mouth of the Little Elk up to the Cherry River the Gauley flows in a narrow 
canon 300-400 feet deep, excavated out of the top members |of No. XII., while the softer Lower 
Coal Measures occur back in the summits of the hills on the broad plateau at the top of No. XII. 
The Nutall coal comes up at the mouth of Meadow River, but it thins there. It has a thickness of 
5 to 6 feet on the waters of Hommony, Cherry and other streams, which put in from the south, and 
is a splendid coking coal.

112. Parkersburg. Low water here as given by Col. Roberts is 562.804. See Note 35. 

113. The elevations given for these locks is the top of the mitre sill below the dams. From* 
Parkersburg for 25 miles up the river the rocks are nearly horizontal and the Upper Meretta sand- 
stone of the Permian Series, which is quarried at Parkersburg, (Jackson quarry,) makes clitfs in the- 
river hills for a long distance. It is extensively quarried at Elizabeth. 

114. Lock Four. Near here is Burning Springs, the famous oil district, from which oil was col- 
lected and marketed as far back as 1841. The Eureka Volcano Anticlinal (called the &quot;Oil Break&quot;) 
passes through this region, and brings up 400 feet of the Barren Measures. The Pittsburgh coal is 
absent, or only a few inches thick, while the Crinoidal coal is *0 inches thick and mined below the 
village for local supply. Oil is obtained here in the Mahoning, Conglomerate, &quot;Big Injun&quot; (Pacors) 
and Maxburg (Gantz) sands. 

115. OranUvilU. Here the Waynesburg is in the summit of the hills. 

116. Steer Creek, At the mouth of this stream the massive sandstone above the Pittsburgh coal 
comes above water level, and the base of the great Waynesburg sandstone cliff is 275 feet above the- 
same. 

117. Tanner Fork. Along this stream the Waynesburg coal is mined for local use. It is only IS 
to 24 inches thick and at Tannersville 6 miles up the stream is 135 feet above the latter. 

118. Third Run Shoals. The Waynesburg Coal shows in summit of hill here 36O feet above the 
river or 1050 A. T. The horizon of the Pittsburgh coal is about 50 feet above the river, but the coal 
is absent. 

119. Glenyillc. A broad anticlinal, which is probably identical with the Chestnut Ridge axis.. 
crosses the river above Glenville and hoists the Pittsburgh coal 225 feet above the same. This coal 
makes its first appearance here it being absent or but feebly developed everywhere below until its 
horizon dips unaer water near the mouth of Steer Creek; at one ana a half miles above Glenville it 
is 4 to 5 feet thick and 200 feet above the river. It runs along the hills at near this level for a mile 
or two further and then dips rapidly down below water level, passing under the river \y 4 miles- 
below Land Fork or \Qti% miles from Parkersburg. The sandstone above the coal has an immense 
development in this region, beinp 130 feet thick. The horizon of the Pittsburgh coal keeps 50 to 75- 
feet below river level till we come to Stout&apos;s Mil&apos;s, when the basin is crossed and it begins to rise 
rapidly appearing lo feet above river level, one mile above Stout&apos;s Mills, and one-half mile further up- 
stream is 75 feet above the same. It is here 7 feet thick and there is a great coal field in this basin 
between Burnsville and Glenville.

1. The term Jurasso-Cretaceous is chosen to designate the Upper Secondary Sandstones of the 
Virginia reports and the associated sands and clays which in their prolongation, northeast through 
Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, are found to underlie the Cretaceous green-sand formation 
of those State-, because the fossils found in the vicinity of Fredericksburg, etc., in Virginia, as 
well aw near Baltimore, suggest the upper stage of the Jurassic period; while it is stated that the 
sands and clays of this belt in New Jersey are referable to the base of the Cretaceous. The whole 
group would seem in the main to be one of transition, and it is probably best comparable to the 
European Wealden. 

2 The name Jurasso-Triassic is preferred for the Mid-Secondary rocks of the Virginia reports, 
as it is thought to correspond best with the fossil indications thus far furnished by the several belts 
included in it. Of these, the most western area is in part continuous with the so-called Triassio belt 
of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and in part with the coal bearing rocks of Dan River, North Carolina. 
The middle belt is in the line of prolongation of the Deep River coal rocks of North Carolina, and 
the eastern belt, including the Grits and Coal Measures of Chesterfield, Henrico, etc., is topograph- 
ically without a counterpart. The middle and eastern belts in Virginia, and the western tract in 
North Carolina, show a close agreement in their fossil flora, which in many particulars has a decid- 
edly Jurassic character, and all three belts are connected by certain species of Estheria, Candona, 
etc., held in common. Collectively these beds represent most probably a group of deposits ranging 
through Upper Triassic, and Lower Jurassic time, and are in large measure of a transitional 
character. 

3. In jrrouping the Lower Paleozoic formations, Sedgewick&apos;s classification is used, including as 
Cambrian and Siluro- Cambrian, all the formations from the base of the Paleozoic to the top of the 
Trenton period (4 c.), and as Silurian the succeeding formations to the top of the Oriskany (8.); these 
corresponding in limits to the Upper and Lower Silurian periods of the table. 

4. The Middle Cambrian, or Auroral group, occupying much of the surface of the great valley 
west of the Blue Ridge, and exposed in numerous anticlinals and faults in the mountain belt farth- 
er we^t, is marked by a great preponderance of magnesian limestones in the lower two-thirds of its 
mass, passing below in many cases into Arenaceous and Argillaceous limestones, and followed 
above by oolitic and by cherty and sandy bed* theae Utter ivin# oUn atill higher to th

more purely Calcareous and Argillo-Calcareous strata appertaining to the base of the Siiuro-Cam- 
brian, Trenton, or Matinal group. The frequent faults, inversions and repetitions of the beds in 
the great valley, and the rarity of fossils in the Auroral rocks, have interfered with a precise 
demarcation of formations, but there can be little dOubt, from fossil and other evidence, that they 
cover the period of the formations 3 a., 3 b., 3 c., assigned&amp;to them in the Table. Hence, and as 
indicating the formations near as well as at the localities, the designation 3 a. b. will be used for 
these rocks up to the top of the magnesian, without distinguishing between Calciferous and 
Quebec (or Levis), and 3 b. c., for the remaining strata up to the well defined base of the Siluro- 
Cambrian, Trenton or Matinal group, 4 a. b. and c. 

5. The Potsdam, or Primal group, includes in Virginia, where complete, besides the Potsdam 
proper, the ferriferous shales next above, and the slates, shaly grits and conglomerates, below this 
formation. It is exposed in varying mass and completeness on the western slope and in the west 
flanking hills of the Blue Ridge throughout much of its length, often, by inversion, dipping to the 
southeast, in seeming conformity beneath the older rocks of the Blue Ridge, but often, also resting 
uncomformably upon or against them. These older rocks, comprising masses referable probably 
to Huronian and Laurentian age, include also a group of highly altered beds, corresponding 
apparently to the copper-bearing or Keweenian series of Northern Michigan, and perhaps to the 
lately described Dimetian rocks of Wales. 

6. The letters A, B, C, D mark four rather distinct groups of Archaean rocks found in Virginia, 
of which the first three may probably be referred to the Laurentian, Huronian and Montalban. 
periods respectively, and the fourth to an intermediate stage the Norian or Upper Laurentian. 

7. This belt of Siluro-Cambrian slates extends continuously from the Potomac River to a point 
about ten miles south of Staunton, a distance&apos; of 140 miles, beyond which it becomes narrow and 
discontinuous. In the tract corresponding to the interval, from Strasburg to Harrisonburg, it 
encloses the complex synclinal of the Massanutten Mountains, consisting of massive ranges of 
Silurian rocks 5 a. 5 b.. with some bands of 7 and a few traces of Devonian 10 a., all resting in the 
wide undulated trough of the slates. From Strasburg southwest, the railroad keeps generally a 
distance of from one-half to one mile west of the edge of the slates, but sometimes impinges upon 
it, affording ready access to fossiliferous beds of 4 a., b. and c. 

8. About 13 miles west-by-north from this are the Rawley Springs, and a few miles farther the 
remarkable fissured rocks known as Moravian Town, both in Ponent 12. West-by-south, about 20 
miles are the Dora coal mines, in Vespertine 13 a., of Narrowback mountain anthracite, faulted 
and crushed. The irregular fault, which, with many interruptions, extends from near the Potomac 
River along the northwest edge of the Great Valley in the line of the Little North Mountain for 
about 120 miles, is seen near these localities to, bring the Siluro-Cambrian 4. of the valley into 
juxtaposition with the Devonian 10. to 12. 

9. About eight miles east of this are Weyer&apos;s and Madison&apos;s caves, situated in a ridge of steep 
dipping limestone, 3 a. b., near the South River. 

10. In this part of the gold belt are situated the old workings, known as Tinder&apos;s, Boxley&apos;s, 
Baker&apos;s, Triple Fork and Walton&apos;s Mines. 

11. This is a good point of departure for examining the rock structure of Panther Gap, 5 a. b., 
mostly inverted, and the wild passage of the North River through the same formations at Streck- 
ler&apos;s Gap, &quot; The Goshen Pass.&quot; About 10 miles southwest are the Rockbridge Alum Springs, in 
10. a. b. 

12. About three miles north of this, on the Cow Pasture River, is the Blowing Cave of Bath 
County, in an anticlinal of 8. Oriskany ; and twelve miles farther north-by-west, near the same 
river, is the noted intermitting stream called the Ebbing Spring, in a ridge of 7 and 8, on east side 
of Tower Hill, east of Warm Spring Axis. Twelve miles southwest to Bath Alum Springs, in 10 a., 
and thence 5 miles to Warm Springs, 3 c-4 a. 

13. Where traversed by the Jackson&apos;s River, this anticlinal shows itself as a great arch built 
up of the successive concentric beds of 6 a. b. c., and flanked by 7. and 8., followed by 10 a., and 
having a span, as measured by the highest sandstone bed, of about 3,300 feet. The main arch, 5 a. 
Levant, or Medina, white sandstone, is regular and unbroken, but the outer concentric belts, made 
up of the hard members of 5 b. c., are distorted and in part inverted on the west side of the axis, 
where by a slight fault the beds of 7, pass suddenly from a nearly vertical to a horizontal position. 
Towards the southwest, this axis opens to form the Rich Patch Valley, bringing to view the 
Siluro-Cambrian 4 a, b, c, and still farther southwest becomes the closed anticlinal known as the 
Pott&apos;s Creek Mountain. Heavy beds of iron ore (Hematite} have been opened on both sides of 
this axis, as at Roaring Run, Call ie&apos;s, Low Moor, and Kaysers near Clifton Forge, associated with 
formation 8. Oriskany. The fossil ore of 5 b. is also mined at several points.

14. The Anticlinal Valley, which includes the group of thermals known as the Warm, Hot, 
Healing, etc., Springs, closes up about ten miles northeast of this, and its axis subsides towards 
the southwest in broad spurs which reach the river a few miles below Covington, in low arches of 
7. and 8., overlaid by 10. The heated waters issue at numerous points throughout a distance of 
thirty miles; from Cambrian and Siluro-Cambrian rocks, 3. c., 4 a., usually inverted and often 
faulted along the west side of the valley, the eastern boundary of which it formed by the massive 
Warm Spring Mountain, 5 a. 5 b., dipping east, while its western limit consists of a narrow, broken 
ridee of the same formations in a vertical or inverted position. Stages to Healing, Hqt and Warm 
Springs, severally 15, 19. and 22 miles. Near the first is the Cascade (200 feet) of Falling Spring 
which, cutting through the west wall of the anticlinal, flows over a mass of calcareous 
tufa, deposited from the waters. 

The anticlinal of Peter&apos;s Mountain, rising a few miles northwest of Covington and exposing at 

:mel 7. and 8., expands towards the southwest, until it opens out into the valley of the Sweet 

Springs, containing another group of thermals of lower temperature than the preceding. This 

anticlinal, extending southwest, does not close up, but passes into the great Peter&apos;s Mountain and 

; iver Mountain fault, which for a distance of fifty miles brings the Cambrian in contact with 

the Vespertine and Umbral formation, Sub-Carb., 13 a., 13 b. 

l~&gt;. The Upper Subcarboniferous, or Umbral Shales, here include a considerable thickness of 
brown and gray flaggy sandstone, the same which forms the hard rock of Swope&apos;s Knobs. 

16. About 20 miles northwest of this point (by canal or road) we enter the gorge by which the 
James River traverses the Blue Ridge, where are exposed fine sections of Archaean rocks, A and B. 
and of the Cambrian, Primal 2 a., resting unconformably on the westorn slope of the former, ana 
occupying the flanking ridges, which adjoin the valley. The Natural Bridge, the remnant of a 
former tunnel or cave in 3 a. D., is about 8 miles northwest from the upper end of the gap. 

17. A few miles east of this, between Bannister and Dan Rivers, is a small patch of Jurasso- 
:o rocks, 18-17., corresponding to the Farmville or Middle belt, (see note 2), and containing 

Estheria, etc. 

18. Thi* deposit, made up largely of Diatoms, lies near the base, but within the limits, of the 
Miocene Tertiary. It contains occasional casts of Miocene shells, and is generally overlaid by beds 
of this formation, and rests either upon or but little above the top of the Eocene. Having 
formerly traced this deposit from the Patuxent River in Maryland to the Meherrin in Virginia,! 
have lately found by an examination of the artesian borings at Fortress Monroe, that a similar

deposit exists in that region at the depth of 558 feet below the surface, overlaid by Miocene and 
Pliocene beds, and resting upon an Eocene deposit identical with that which underlies it at Rich-

of estimating the thickness of the Tertiary formations as far east as the mouth of the JMHOI

19. From this point, for many miles towards the southwest, the railroad runs near to and almost 
parallel with the broken synclinal, (about 25 miles long), of which the lofty Catawba and Fort 
Lewis Mountains are the principal parts. The former, composed of southeast dipping 4 a. b., etc., 
forms the farther or northwest rim of the synclinal, and bending abruptly around at its northeast 
end, becomes the Tinker Mountain, which closes the basin in that direction. A shorter and gentler 
bend at the southwest end, terminates in a fault. The corresponding rocks of the southeast, or 
near side of the synclinal, are only partially preserved in a narrow inverted ridge at either end, the 
remainder of this rim of the synclinal having been engulfed in the prolonged fault, which, for 
many miles along the margin of the basin, has brought the Siluro-Cambrian rocks (4 a. c.) of the 
valley to abut against, and over-ride the Devonian 10. to 12. and the Vespertine 13 a., of which the 
Fort Lewis Mountain, the central mass of the synclinal, is mainly composed. 

20. A few miles west-by-north of this is an area of Vespertine rocks, 13 a., including one or 
more workable beds of coal, mined on Strouble&apos;s Run and elsewhere. This area once probably 
continuous with the Vespertine of Fort Lewis Mountain, is almost encompassed by faults. Farther 
to the northwest, and separated from the above by a belt of Cambrian and Siluro-Cambrian rocks 
3 c., 4 a., etc., the Vespertine beds of the southeast slope of the Brushy Mountain, contain a similar 
coal, mined on Tom&apos;s Creek, etc., all these seams being more or less affected by the neighboring 
faults. The dislocation which, southeast of Brushy Mountain, brings Vespertine and Umbral in 
apposition with Siluro-Cambrian Matinal, is part of the great fault which, with some changes of 
direction and character, extends along (he northwest edge of the great valley, from near the James 
Hirer to the end of the Brushy Mountain, northeast of Abingdon, a distance of about 125 miles.

At a distance of 23 miles, in a northwest direction, is the sheet of water called &quot;Mountain Lake,&quot; 
situated near the top of Salt Pond Mountain, at a height of 4,000 feet above tide. Here the Potts 
and Johns Creek Mountains and the other ridges of 5 a. b. coalesce at their southwest termination, 
into a lofty rugged table-land, overlooking the New River, and commanding wide views. 

21. A few miles south, the Lick Mountain range divides the valley for some miles into two and 
in the southern of these belts, on the New Eiver, below the mouth of Cripple Creek, are the 
Austenville lead mines, in 3 b., near the Primal 2 b. of Popular Camp Mountain, and about 15 miles 
distant from Wytheville. 

22. From this point a short branch railroad leads north into the valley of the north fork of the 
Holston River, between Walker&apos;s Mountain, 5 a , etc., and Poor Valley ridge, Vespertine 13 c., etc., 
which flanks the Clinch Mountain on the southeast side. Here, near Saltville, are the remarkable 
salt wells, which penetrate into a thick mass of rock-salt ; and in the same vicinity, and at various 
points higher up the valley, for a distance of 20 miles, beds of gypsum have been opened and 
extensively wrought. These deposits are found near and in a line of fault, along which the Siluro- 
Cambrian 3 c. 4 a., of the southeast side of the valley, has been made to abut against and some- 
times over-ride the Umbral 13 b., which, with the Vespertine 13 a. of the Poor Valley Mountain, 
form a belt on the northwest side of the valley. Both deposits are most probably referable to the 
Subcarboniferous period. The fault here spoken of extends, with some local changes of character 
and direction, in a west-by-southwest course, from a point in Giles county to the Tennessee line, a 
distance of 125 miles, and is prolonged many miles into Tennessee. WILLIAM B. ROGERS.

24. Richmond is on the west margin of the Mesozoic and Tertiary belt. (See Rogers Note 18.) 
These formations may be seen in railway cut near Tredegar Iron Works, at the York River Railway 
station, and on the margin of Shocco Creek, near the Medical College. The bed of the river is gneis- 
soid granite at the city, and for several miles above. 

26. At Korah large quantities of granite, doubtless of Laurentian age, are quarried for shipment. 
Another large quarry is opened opposite Westham, on south side of the river. Between Westham 
and Lorraine the road passes from the Archaean to the Mesozoic coal-bearing beds (17, 18), and con- 
tinues on them for about 10 miles to Dover. 

26. Boscobel, or Dover, near the west margin of the coal field, is near the old Dover Mines. Fos- 
sils in th&quot; dfbris of the coal slates. 

27. Between this point and Goochland C. H., a mica mine was formerly worked (in 1 b.), but not 
exhausted. 

[N. B. In our notes on the Archaean rocks, we recognize only Laurentian (1 a.) and Huronian 
(I b.) ; and even the horizon between these is uncertain in this part of Virginia.] 

28. At Columbia a granite quarry is worked in 1 a., overlaid by mica and hydro-mica slates and 
schi.-ts of 1 I). This is the best point from which to visit the several gold mines in the vicinity. 

29. Bremo Bluff is a good point of departure for examining several objects of interest, (a) &quot;The 
Bluff,&quot; near the station, is apparently a closed anticlinal fold of beds of hard gneissoid sandstone and 
arenaceous slates, nearly vertical in position. A second bluff of the same general structure occurs 
about 200 yards farther up the river. The syncline between them and outside flanks of both are occu- 
pied with argilla&lt;:&lt;-&quot;tis slut*--:. The same ledges appear on the opposite side of the river. (M At this 
point a branch (Buckingham Branch) railway crosses the river to extensive slate quarries, about five 
miles distant, and apparently in the same formation (1 b.) as the slates about the &quot; Bluff.&quot; Future 
explorations may modify this view, (c) Willis Mountain, about 20 miles east of this station, is an 
isolated mas- - .f gneittokl rooks, r-ontaining numerous crystals of kyenite of different shades of color, 
and of hornblende and tourmaline, with other minerals, (d) This is one of the best portions of the 
gold belt. Iron ores limonite, hematite and magnetite abound here. 

30. From Richmond to ScottsviUe the road cuts the strata by a route generally at riglit angles, 
or nearly so, to their strike; and for several miles below the town the outcroppings, mostly of 1 b., 
show frequent changes of dip, and are occasionally nearly horizontal. The route here changes 
towards the southwest.

31. About three miles below Howardsville the river and road cut into the lowest beds of a 
Mesozoic trough, or oval basin, that covers several square miles of area, the larger portion on the 
north side of the river. The remarkable coarse conglomerate that forms the base of this series of 
rocks is well exposed in contact with Archaean rocks along the banks of Rockfish River, near the sta- 
tion, and along a little stream running through the neighboring village, while the overlying ferrugi- 
nous sandstones and slates appear in the surrounding hills. After passing this Mesozoic tract, the 
route, following the windings of the James River, keeps within the general trend of a belt four or 
five miles wide, in which are several beds of limestone and ores of iron imbedded in still heavier 
strata of micaceous, talcose and chloritic slates and schists, all most probably of Huronian age. After 
following this limestone and ore belt for about 40 miles, the bearing is abruptly changed toward the 
northwest about. six miles below Lynchburg. 

32. At points between Greenway and Stapleton numerous ore mines and limestone quarries have 
been opened on both sides of the river. 

33. At Lynchburg the river has cut the beds (1 a. and b.) nearly at right angles, so as to expose a 
well-defined waving arch on the cliff opposite the city. For about 20 miles above the city the road 
continues on the gneisses, granites and slates of Archaean age. 

34. At about a mile below Rope Ferry is the margin of a belt of alternating conglomerates, 
sandstones and slates about two miles wide, which were formerly classed as Huronian by 
Rogers and others. This belt flanks the southeast slope of the Blue Ridge, and is cut by the river so 
as to give fine exposures of its beds both above and below the railway bridge. The discovery we 
recently made of scolithus borings of the kind characteristic of Cambrian (Potsdam) sandstones in its 
beds, determines its age to be Cambrian. The &quot;Snowdon Slate Quarries &quot; are in this Cambrian belt 
three miles towards the northeast. 

35. At Balcony Falls, between one and two miles below the station, the river has cut obliquely- 
through the core of the main Blue Ridge and exposed a fine section of Archaean rocks. These have 
been formerly spanned by the Cambrian beds, the upper portions of which were doubtless ruptured 
at the time of the upheaval and swept away. At this point occurs the finest natural section of the 
whole Cambrian series to be found anywhere in Virginia. The alternations of conglomerates, shales 
and sandstones present an aggregate thickness of about 1,200 ft. The uppermost sandstone, about 
350 ft. thick, is the typical Potsdam, and abounds in borings of scolithus linearis, thousands of which 
may be seen in the broken rocks at the junction of the Lexington branch, 150 yards above the station 
house. Here the road enters the Great Silurian Valley. 

36. Glenwood is the station for stage line to Natural Bridge. (See Note 16.) The road here 
passes through a depression in the Sailings Mountain, an anticlinal ridge of primordial strata, 2 a. b. 
The Natural Bridge, three miles from this station by stage line, is in Lower Silurian limestone; the 
abutments in Quebec (3 b.); the arch and the adjacent hills in Chazy (3 c.) This great natural curi- 
osity has been supposed by some observers to be the remnant of a natural tunnel, and by others the 
remains of an extensive cave, the top of which has all fallen in and been washed away except the 
narrow arch that now spans the chasm. Our belief is that it has resulted from a vertical fissure in 
the beds of limestone, which, by its opening, failed to rupture the portion of the uppermost beds 
that now forma the arch, but simply dragged them a few yards toward the west and left them 
stretched across the deep chasm, which has been subsequently enlarged by erosion. The entire 
absence of stalactites and stalagmites along the faces of the canon militates strongly against the caT6 
theory, while the secondary fissures still to be seen just above the bridge, together with the general

appearance of the place seem to favor the view here proposed. On the opposite side of the river are 
the Glenwood Iron Mines of Judge Anderson. 

37. Indian Rock. Trenton limestone, gray coralline, quarried largely here for lime. 

38. Purgatory Mountain terminates abruptly near Buchanan. It is a somewhat isolated outlier 
of North Mountain. Its base is Trenton limestone (4 a.), its main mass Utica and Hudson shales (4 b. 
and 4 c.), while its cap is Medina (5 a.) ; and in a synclinal trough held in a position where its top it 
double, it carries fine beds of limonite and red shale ores. 

39. From Buchanan to Eagle Rock the limestones of 3 b. and 3 c. are exposed to view in several 
cuts, and at Eagle Rock they disappear beneath the groups of Trenton (4), of Medina (5), Salina ? (6), 
Lower Helderberg (7), Oriskany (8), Marcellus, etc. (Devonian slates, 10 a. and 10 b.) The mountain 
at this pass is a prolongation of North Mountain, and has its higher members partially inverted, a 
feature very characteristic of this range throughout the greater portion of Virginia. The road here 
passes into a synclinal valley with Helderberg (7) and Oriskany (8) for its bottom, and most of ita 
surface covered with Devonian slates, 10 a. b. 

40. Price&apos;s Bluff is an anticlinal arch of 7 and 8, and furnishes good limestone and ore of iron. 

41. Clifton Forge is a point of great interest to geologists. (See Rogers Note 13.) 

4^. Loch Laird. A small bed (or dike) of trap between two beds of calcareous shale (3 a.) may 
be seen 100 yards above the Shenandoah Valley Railway junction. 

43. Green Forest is the station for the extensive Buena Vista Iron Mines, in the primordial (2 b.) 
shales at the northwestern base of the Blue Ridge. 

44. For Lexington and its surroundings, see note No. 74. 

45. Henrico Coal Company&apos;s station for shipping coal and coke. 

46. This road, throughout its whole length of 240 miles, runs on the Siluro-Cambrian and the 
Cambrian formations, chiefly on the former. 

47. Hagerttoicn stands on what seems to be the eastern portion of a closed and inverted syncline 
of Trenton age ; the axis in the shales farther west. The Trenton limestones crop out near both of 
the depots, and are quarried for local building purposes The road continues on this formation for 
several miles, but soon after passing Grimes it runs obliquely across the margin to 3 b. c. 

48. At Shepherdstown are extensive exposures of 3 b. on the margins of the Potomac. Hydraulic 
limestone has been extensively quarried here for the manufacture of cement. 

49. Between Riverton and Port Republic the Massanutten range of mountains is conspicuous 
on the northwest side of the road. (See Rogers note 7). The Blue Ridge is seen from the train on the 
southeast at nearly all points alone the whole line. Over a large portion of the route the country 
rocks are very much obscured by the local drift from the adjacent mountains. In the larger boulders 
from the Blue Ridge, the burrows of the scholithus linearis are abundant.

50. Overall. Half a mile east of Overall station. Umber deposit, which has been partially 
developed. (M.) 

51. At Luray, the station, the junction, and the greater part of the village, appear to rest upon 
the ledges of 3 b., Quebec (Levis), dipping 20 to 30 northwest, and passing oeneath a ridge of 3 c. 
(Chazy), in which is the entrance to the caverns ; and most probably the higher chambers are in the 
same formation, while the lower ones are either within or rest upon beds of 3 b. Everywhere in the 
great valley of Virginia the limestones of the Quebec, as a rule, are much more ferruginous than 
those of the Chazy, and consequently produce darker and more fertile soils. The Quebec also car- 
ries several thick beds of shale, while the Chazy is characterized in many places by beds of chert 
that contain characteristic fossils. The lithological peculiarities of these two formations, especially 
those which determine differences of soils, are well defined at Luray. (See note 75.) 

52. Marksville. Considerable deposits of light brown ochre worked here by Oxford Ochre 
Company. 

53. Milnes. About five miles south southeast of Milnes there is a fine exhibition of the Potsdam 
ores (in the slates above the Potsdam sandstone), the principal development being on Fox Mountain, 
a low flat crested ridge, a foot hill of the Blue Ridge. The present working face is 85x300 ft., and the 
daily output is over 100 tons, shipped over the branch road to the Shenandoah Iron Co.&apos;s furnace, 
near Milnes. (M.) 

54. Weyers Cave has the same geological relations as the Luray Cave, except that it is nearer 
the margin of the Trenton trough, which carries the Massanuttens, and here extends to the south- 
west beyond the termination of the mountain range. 

55. Vesuvius. The Rockbridge tin mines are in the Archaean core of the Blue Ridge, and may be 
reached by ordinary road, from either Vesuvius or Irish Creek Station. 

55. Crimora. Two miles east from Crimora there is a large valuable deposit of Manganese ore, 
chiefly pyrolusite. The ore is very rich, and is now being mined in quantity for shipment to Eng- 
land and to Pittsburg, Pa., at the latter place for use in the production of a remarkably high grade of 
ferro manganese. (M.) 

56. Sherando. Near Sherando (Lipcomb Station), deposits of China Clay and Fire clay are 
being worked. (M.) 

57. Vesuvius. Eight miles southeast of Vesuvius Station, and on a bank of Irish Creek, there is 
quite an interesting exhibition of tin ore. The ore is Cassaterite ; and at one point on the Cash 
property the ore showed remarkably rich, at times being almost pure Cassaterite, and some of the 
specimens showing one to one and a half inches in thickness of the pure ore. (See page 134 McCreath&apos;s 
Mineral Wealth of Virginia). Occasionally the tin ore has associated with it the mineral Mispickel, 
carrying more or less silver and gold. On the Vesuvius furnace property, and two and a half miles 
from the railroad, occurs a bed of brown hematite ore, ten feet wide, between nearly vertical walls of 
Potsdam sandstones. (M.) 

58. Near Irish Creek a remarkable deposit of Dufrenite (Hydrated Ferric Phosphate), nearly a 
foot thick, of nodular and radiating structure, was found several years ago in the Potsdam shales, 
resting on a heavy bed of limonite ore. (See American Journal of Science, July 1881, pp. 65, etc.) 

59. At Loch Laird, about sixty yards northeast of the crossing of the Richmond&amp;Alleghany 
Railway, a trap dike about six feet thick may be seen thrust up between two beds of calc-shale of 3 a. 

59. Loch Laird. On the Buena Vista property there is a fine exhibition of the Potsdam ores 
(in the slates overlying the Potsdam), showing perhaps the finest development of these ores in the 
Shenandoah Valley. On the same property where Marl Branch crosses the Lexington Turnpike, 
there is exposed a bed of so called Marl, fully 40 ft. thick. It yields over 95 per cent, carbonate of 
lime. (M.) 

60. At Thompson is an old cement Quarry. 

61. Arcadia. Near Buchanan, on the Arcadia furnace property, there are numerous openings 
made on the so-called specular ore of the Blue Ridge. The ore is a red hematite, more or less inti- 
mately mixed with fine grained quartz. Geologically it lies in the slates underlying the Potsdam 
sandstone. (M ) 

62. Lithia is near the border of the extensive Cloverdale iron property; ore in 2 b. and 3 a.

63. Houston. Near Houston Station are the Houston Mines of the Crozer Steel and Iron Co., 
extensively worked to supply their furnace at Roanoke. Rich Manganese ore is also mined here and 
shipped to Johnstown and Plttsburg. (M.) 

64. Between Cloverdale and Tinker Creek the road skirts the northwest base of a Trenton ridge, 
capped with 5 a. b. sandstones. It is known locally as Mill&apos;s mountain ; really an outlier of Tinker Mt. 

65. The New River Division of the Norfolk&amp;Western starts from Central, and has its present 
terminus at Pocahontas, where it strikes the great Flat Top coal field. It passes through a very inter- 
esting geological field. At &apos;Ripplemead Station there is a promising deposit of Magnetic Iron ore, in 
the No. 3 Lower Silurian Limestone opened up on the bank of New River. Some 5,000 tones of 63 
per cent, ore have been taken out. (M.) 

66. The &quot; Cripple Creek &quot; extension of the Norfolk&amp;Western Railroad (now being built) starts 
from Pulaski, and will open up the Cripple Creek region (see note 21 on Virginia), with its vast stores 
of brown hematite ores in 3 b. and c. (and 2 b.), perhaps the finest and richest, and most uniform 
quality of (3 b. c., Lower Silurian) brown hematite ores in the United States. It will also bring 
within railroad communication (for the railroad will pass close to it) the loo year old lead mine at 
Austinville, and the Bertha Zinc mine near New River, showing rich Zinc ore (Silicate and Carbonate 
of Zinc) almost free from lead, and now used at the Bertha Zinc Works), at Pulaski (Martins). N&lt;ar 
Blue Ridge, and also near Roanoke (about two and a half miles south of it), important and seemingly 
very large deposits of Potsdam ores are now being mined at the former point, by the Crozer Iron and 
Steel Company, of Roanoke, and at the latter by Roser Iron Company. 

From eight to ten miles south southeast of Bristol there are interesting deposits of hematite 
ore in the No. 11 limestones. These were opened, many years ago, to supply stock for the local char- 
coal furnaces, but the ores were found too refractory for economical use in such furnaces, and the 
workings were abandoned. The ore is a dense and fine grained hematite, and shows 64 to 66 per 
cent, iron and .020 and .030 of phosphorus. (M.) 

67. Edinburg is the depot for the Liberty and Columbia furnaces, a few miles northwest, in the 
North Mountain range good geological field. 

68. Broadway is a good starting point for studying geology, etc., of Brock&apos;s Gap, an interesting 
region in North Mountain ran 

69. Staunton, a flourishing little city at the junction of the valley railroad with the Chesapeake 
8. Ohio, is situated on a number of somewhat distinct hills, and surrounded by others of still greater 
height. These are composed chiefly of Quebec (3 b.) masrnesian limestones at their --ially 
on the northwest flanks, and Chazy limestones of lighter color above, with interbedded cherty masses, 
the fragments of which are seen strewn over the surfaces in great profusion. Several species of gas- 
teropod and cephalopod shells have been found fossil in these chert beds. The northeastern margin 
of the city rests on Trenton, 4 a., adjoining 4c.; but the line of contact of these formations sweeps 
around the southeast and south flanks of two very conspicuous hills, known as &quot;Betsy Bell&apos;&apos; and 
&quot; Mary Gray,&quot; and appears again on the valley road &apos;near Folly Mills Station, and continues near the 
line of road for several miles. (See Note 75 as to the Quebec group.)

the cuts 

below the crossing ; but the Chazy beds form the country rock of the town and region between it and 
Raphine Station. The Primordial (Cambrian) ridges of the Blue Ridge range extend much farther 
into the Great Valley opposite Greenville, than they do at any other point seen from the line of this 
road, and carry some productive beds of limonite ore. 

71. About 2% miles northwest of Raphine Station are very extensive beds of limonite ores on the 
lands of Samuel Carson, Esq., and Messrs. Gibbs&amp;Rawlings. The beds of ore have been partially 
opened, and, where seen in place, appear to occupy about the same relative position among the 
Chazy to c.) limestones as the chert beds found in such abundance in other parts of the same forma- 
tion. The Vesuvius Iron Mines are in 2 b., about four or five miles southeast of this station. The 
tin mines, now in process of development, are in the Archaean core of the Blue Ridge, about 12 miles 
southeast by turnpike. 

72. At Fairfield the road crosses to the west side of Timber Ridge, and on the northwest margin 
of the valley, the elevated outliers of the North Mountain range the Jump, the Hogback and House 
Mountains become conspicuous features of a striking landscape. 

73. From Timber Ridge Station a line of conveyances extends to Rockbridge Baths, a pleasant 
summer resort. The thermal water of these baths issues from the Quebec (3 b.) limestones near a 
fissure or fault where the beds of 4 a. Trenton have dropped down to the level of 3 b., and apparently 
dip beneath the latter, as may be seen at points northeast and southwest beyond the accumulations 
of river drift, which is found on hills here more than 100 feet above the bed of the river. About two 
miles northwest of the baths is the entrance to the famous &quot; Goshen Pass,&quot; the deep canon through 
which North River finds its way to the Great Valley This canon gives a complete section of the 
whole North Mountain range from 4 a. Trenton up to Devonian shales, 10 a. b. Fossils are abun- 
dant here. For sketch and geological section, see Am. Jour, of Sci., Vol. XVIII., 1879, p. 119. 

74. About one mile southwest of Timber Ridge Station the railway passes abruptly from the 
Chazy (3 c.) to the Trenton (4 a.), entering the irregular synclinal trough in which Lexington is situ- 
ated. In the town, along the cliffs of the adjacent north branch of James River, and over about six 
miles of area towards the northeast and four miles southeast, the Trenton limestones (4 a.) are the 
country rocks; but in the Poplar Hills toward the southwest and south, the Utica shales, with very 
fossiliferous thin beds of limestone, become conspicuous. The Brushy Hills, west of the town, are 
composed of Chazy limestones and cherts (3 c.), as regards their southeastern slopes, while the north- 
western slopes present exposures of 3 b. dipping beneath the hills. As far as measurements can be 

. is about 300 feet, 



made here 3 c. 



and 3 b. about 450 feet thick. Along the eastern base of Brushy Hills the 



outcrop of the lower Trenton limestone, 4 a., is apparently an ancient coral-reef, now a very compact, 
pure coral limestone, quite largely quarried for local building purposes, and for the manufacture of 
lime. This coralline bed contains shells as well as coral. It varies from 100 to 150 feet in thickness. 

The House Mountain (or rather pair of mountains), about six miles west northwest from Lexing- 
ton, is one of the most striking features of the grand scenery in this portion of the Great Valley. 
This isolated mountain group rests upon Trenton limestone which crops out around the base. Then 
in nearly horizontal strata other formations, 4 b., as shales and shaly limestones, 4 c., as purplish, 
ferruginous shales and shaly sandstones, and above all a cap of Medina sandstones, 5 a.; the whole ris- 
ing 2,000 feet above the limestone valley below. Lexington is a good point of departure for the geologi- 
cal study of either the Blue Ridge range on the S. E. or the North Mountain range on the N. W. 

Washington and Lee Unirersity and the V. M. Institute, both located here, have good mineral 
and geological cabinets. For fuller details, and geological section across the Great Valley near Lex- 
ington, see Am. Jour, of Sci., Vol. XVIII., 1879, p. 16. 

75. Quebec Group. Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn, the successor of Sir Wm. Logan, as Director of the Geologi- 
cal Survey of Canada, does not recognize the Quebec as a geological formation, and in Professor J. D. 
Dana&apos;s table, as given in this guide, it is omitted, being considered as merged in the Calciferous. 
Professor Campbell, of Virginia, is not prepared to adopt this view as suitable for that State. He 
reports that throughout the Great Valley of Virginia, 350 miles in length, with continuous ledges of 
limestone, there exists what is known as the Canadian group, consisting of three tolerably well defined 
sub-groups of limestones, with extensive beds of interstratified shales and calcareous sandstones in 
the lowest 3 a. Calciferous; very regular stratified beds of dolomitic limestones more or less ferrugi- 
nous and producing rich soils in the next higher 3 b. Levis ; and, in the last, some beds of pure 
limestone, with a stratum of brown sandstone in the lower portion, abounding in molluscean fossils, 
not well preserved, but doubtless 3 c. Chazy; and still higher, near the Trenton, beds of chert 
abounding in cephalopoda and gastropods of undoubted 3 c. Chazy age. He, therefore, prefers to 
retain the three divisions, at least until additional palseontological evidence settles the question 
at issue. J. M.

Sketch of the Geology and Topography of North Carolina. 

Derived from the State Geological Reports of Prof. W. C. Kerr. 

North Carolina is the Mountain State of the Atlantic slope. As a general description, it may be 
said that the surface of this State is covered by but two of tne great formations. The (1) Archaean, 
sub-divided into the (1 a.) Laurentian and (1 b.) Huronian, the lowest occupies the western and the 
(20) Quaternary the upper system covers the eastern portion, the oldest and the youngest, with a 
vast geological blank between them. Some of the railways run for long distances on a single forma- 
tion. An irregular line drawn on the map of the State, in a northeast and southwest direction, 
through the City of Raleigh, will show the relative portions of the State covered by each. The (16) 
Triassic, the only one of the intermediate groups which appears, covers but a comparatively insignifi- 
cant area in the middle region. It contains the coal beds of Deep River and of Dan River. The (18) 
Cretaceous and (19) Tertiary, underlie the (20) Quaternary, but they only appear on the surface in a 
few localities, of small area, on the river bluffs, and in water courses and ravines in the eastern 
division. The complete geological series of the State is as follows : (20) Quaternary, (19) Tertiary, 
(18) Cretaceous, (16) Triassic, (1) Huronian, (1 a.) Laurentian and Igneous. 

Most of the metamorphic rocks of North Carolina belong to the (1 a.) Laurentian system, which 
prevails so extensively in Canada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, etc. The prevalent species are 
Granite, Gneiss, Syenite and other Hornblendic rocks, Diorite and Crystalline limestone, and these 
contain graphite and much magnetic and specular iron ore, frequently in very large beds. This for- 
mation, besides iron, produces gold, silver, lead, copper, and other minerals. The (1 b.) Huronian, 
the Taconic of Emmon^s report on this State, occupies several disconnected areas on the Great Smoky 
Mountain, at the Tennessee line and on the Blue Ridge, and another considerable area west of 
Raleigh, extending across the State with two smaller exposures. The rocks are quartzyte and clay 
slates, light colored, drab, and greenish. With these exceptions, and the small area of (16) Triassic, 
all the remainder of the western part of the State is ^1 a.) Laurentian. 

The North Carolina Mountains. The great continental system of the Appalachian Mountains, 
which extends a thousand miles, from near the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the State of Georgia, 
reaches its greatest elevations and develope.s its grandest features in the western part of this State. 
The system is here represented by two great parallel chains, the Smoky Mountains and the Blue 
Ridge, with a net-work of heavy cross chains connecting them and numerous spurs thrown off to 
the east and south, some of them as high as the parent chain and some more than fifty miles long. 
There are also several other disconnected minor chains to the eastward, with the same general 
trend. These mountains extend across the State, and their entire length from their southwestern 
termination, the Blue Mountains in Georgia, to their northern, which is prolonged 50 miles into 
Virginia, is 275 miles, of which two-thirds, or about 5,000 square miles, he within North Carolina. 

The main or western chain, which more to the north borders the great valley in Virginia and is 
there called the Blue Ridge, gradually deviates towards the southwest. A new chain, detached on 
the east and curving a little more to the south, takes now the name of the Blue Ridge, and in this 
State attains gradually to 5,000 and 5,900 feet, composed of many fragments, scarcely connected into 
a continuous and regular chain. These groups are separated by long intervals of depression, in 
which are gaps but little above the interior valleys. 

West of this, and separated from it by a valley, is the great western chain of mountains, named 
locally the Iron Mountain in the northern portion, and Unaka in the southern, the whole being 
known as the Smoky Mountains, and forming the line between Tennessee and North Carolina. This 
is much more continuous, more elevated and regular in its direction and height, and increases very 
uniformly from 5,000 to nearly 6,700 feet. The valley comprised between these two main chains, the 
Smoky Mountain and the Blue Ridge, is divided by transverse chains into many basins of great 



miles wide, with a mean height of more than 2,000 feet, and portions of them 3,500 to 4,000 feet, this 
being the highest plateau of the same extent east of the Rocky Mountains. These are all valleys of 
erosion, and they, as well as the mountains and plateaus have, in Prof. Kerr&apos;s opinion, no anticlinal or 
synclinal origin, being in fact wholly independent of geological structure. 

The mountains which reach 6,000 feet are more than fifty in number, and the loftiest peaks rise to 
6.700 feet. Here, then, in all respects, is the culminating region of the vast Appalachian system. 
This mountain region, where the most striking natural objects in the State are to be seen, has not 
yet been penetrated by the railroads, except that the Western North Carolina R. R. crosses th 
mountains, connecting with the East Tennessee, Virginia A Georgia R. R.

2. At Hillsboro depot a good exposure of typical North Carolina Huronian slate, hydromicaceous. 

3. At Morrisville depot a dike of dolerite visible. One and a half miles east of station beds of 
very coarse incompacted conglomerate, the bottom beds of the Triassic, and probably glacial. 

4. From Statesville west in the numerous deep cuts are seen fine examples of the frost drift, 
characteristic of sub-glacial regions. Also from Hickory to Morgantown many sections of the purple 
paragonite schists, which are peculiar to this region. 

There is very little exposure of solid rock, and that only on the tops of a few high mountains or 
an occasional cliff. The mountains are covered to their very summits with dense forests, but with a 
deep and strong soil which is, however, according to Dr. T. Sterry Hunt&apos;s description, very unlike the 
layers of clay and loam with which we in the North are familiar. The rocks themselves, he says, 
although of gneiss and mica slate, like that which prevails over so great a part of New England, have 
undergone a process of decay which has rendered them so soft that they may be readily cut by a 
spade, although retaining all the veins and layers which mark their original stratification. Without 
having been broken or ground up, these hard rocks have moldered into a soft clayey mass, forming a 
soil fifty feet and often much more in depth, which from its peculiar structure has a natural drainage, 
and possesses great fertility. North Carolina, evidently, never was subjected to the action of glaciers 
like the Northern States. Only the valleys of the streams are covered with alluvium, consisting of 
sand, gravel and clay, the debris of the rocks of the higher ridges and mountains. 

The middle and eastern part of the State is a long slope, extending from the rugjged mountain 
plateau to the Atlantic. Next, however, to the plateau is a, piedmont or middle region of hill country, 
with an average elevation of about 1,000 feet. This is divided by its rivers into three regions, drained 
by the Broad, Catawaba and Yadkin rivers, the slope of the first being toward the south, and that of 
the others a little east of north. These drainage surfaces are separated by two, nearly parallel, east- 
erly chains of mountains, the South and Bushy Mountains, ana are from 2,000 to 4,000 feet high. 
There are other easterly spurs of the Blue Ridge of similar elevation. This middle division or hill

country extends 200 miles from east to west, and 150 miles northeast and southwest, and comprises 
nearly one-half of the territory of the State. It rises in going west about four feet to the mile, and 
attains an elevation of 1,000 to 1,500 feet at the foot of the Blue Ridge. The channels&apos; of the large 
rivers, however, are cut 100 to 300 feet below the intervening divides. 

Between the swamp country, along the coast, and the hilly region of the interior, is a belt of 
level, sandy, barren territory, extending from near the line of Virginia across the entire state, and 
from :5&apos;i to so miles wide, covered by the long leaved pine. Spirits of turpentine produced in this 
pine region is the most important branch of manufacturing in the State. 

Th-&lt;-ast&gt;rn division of the State extends from the coast, about 100 miles, to the lower falls of the 
rivers, and constitutes nearly two-fifths of the State. This region is for the most part nearly level 
or very gently undulating, except along the rivers on the upper reaches of which are bluffs and small 
hills. Its slope seaward is between one and two feet to a mile and it is covered by the horizontal 
strata of the quaternary underlaid by the tertiary. They consist of the noncompacted sands, clays, 
marls and grav*-! materials predominating westward, and becoming successively finer 

towards the . 

The Coast of North Carolina is remarkable for the shallow sounds and bays that extend along 
the entire sea front nearly WO miles, the largest of which are Pamlico and Albermarle Sounds, the 
former 75 miles long by 15 to 20 miles wide, and the latter .50 by 5 to 15 miles, with a depth of water 
from a few feet to 20 feet. There are also along the coast 3,000 to 4,ooo square miles of swamp lands, 
of which the Great Dismal Swamp on the line between this State and Virginia, is well known. 

The foregoing description of North Carolina will serve to give a general idea of the geology of 
South Carolina, also where the same formations are found. J. M.

1. Prepared for this work by Mr. Harry Hammond, of Beech Island, South Carolina. The 
authorities for the geology are designated as follows: II. stands for Prof. Francis Holmes; K. for W 
C. Kerr, of North Carolina; L. for Oscar M. Lieber; T. for M. Tuomey; S. for Charh-s N. Shepard &apos; 

The ereatgroupof crystalline rocks which extends from New England to Alabama is Metamorphic 
without fossils, and hence of doubtful age. In the opinion of some geologists, instead of attempting 
to classify them, it is better to insert in this guide, as Mr. Hammond has done for South Carolina the 
kind of rock along the line of the railroad, e. g. : Gneiss, mic-a schists, granite, etc., which eivt-s us 
some poitiye knowledge. J M. 

2. Cowpens to King Mountain. Itaoolumite, or Diamond rock, the prevailing n.^-k. with seurns of 
marble, limestone, barytes, hematite, specular and argillaceous! schist, with numerous eukl and 
ir &apos;ii mines, and quarries of various rocks.

4. Charleston Junction to Revanel. Beds of phosphate rock. The phosphate rock of South Caro- 
lina, from which large quantities of valuable fertilizers are manufactured, contains 55 to 61 per cent. 
of phosphate of lime, and 5 to 10 per cent, of carbonate of lime, with small quantities of magnesia, 
sulphuric acid, etc. It is in the form of nodules, very rough, rounded and indented, and frequently 
perforated with irregular cavities of an olive, blueish, black, yellowish, brown, or grayish-white 
color, and from a few inches to several feet in diameter. The River Rock occurs as nodules, and 
sometimes as a continuous sheet 8 to 18 inches thick. It is profitably dredged for to depths of 20 feet. 
and a royalty of one dollar per ton is paid to the State for all taken from navigable waters. The land, 
rock is found about the level of meantide in layers 6 to 30 inches thick of loose nodules, and is profitably 
mined under 7 feet of earth. It is found in various places from Florida to North Carolina, has beei t 
raised in artesian wells from a depth of 300 feet, and brought up from sea bottoms several hundred 1 
miles from shore. Harry Hammond, in Hand-Book of South Carolina.

AN AMERICAN GEOLOGICAL RAILWAY GUIDE. (GA.) 



Georgia. : 



GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS OF GEORGIA, 

The Metamorphic area of the State extends from a line crossing the State from Augusta to 
Columbus, extending by Milledgeville and Macon, and extending beyond the line of the State on the 
northeast. The lithological characteristics of the Metamorphic is that of the Archeean in general. 

The paleozoic includes the counties of Dade, Walker, Chattooga, Catoosa, Whitfield, Floyd, Murray, 
Gordon, Barton and Polk, all in the northwest corner of the State. 

The Silurian groups represented, beginning with the lowest, are the Potsdam sandstone, Knox 
Shale and Dolomite, Chazy, Trenton, Cincinnati, Medina, Clinton and Oriskany. The Devonian is 
represented by a black shale of from 10 to 50 feet in thickness. The Sub-Carboniferous by limestones 
and shales of 800 feet. The Coal Measures, confined mostly to the counties of Dade, Walker and 
Chattooga, cover an area of nearly 200 square miles, and contain several beds of coal.

Conglomerate here and at Rowland Springs, also 5 miles from Cartersville. Flexible sandstone 13, 
and manganese 3 and 10, and iron ore beds 3, 5, 7 and 10 miles. 

13. Dalton is situated upon a synclinal, the ridges on each side being Knox Dolomite, and the 
intervening valley in which most of the town is built is made up of Chazy and Trenton Strata. The 
fossils of the last named group may be seen in the limestone exposed on Hamilton Hill, immediately 
north of the town. The Chattoogata Mountain, four miles west, is Upper Silurian. 

14. Tunnel Hill. The tunnel here is cut through a ridge of Knox Dolomite. The Calciferoua 
and Potsdam is in close proximity to the town on the western side. 

15. Ringgold. The Upper Silurian occurs in a high sandstone ridge immediately east of the 
town. The groups here well represented are Medina and Clinton with red fossiliferous iron ore. 
Ori.skany fossils are found abundantly in a single bed of about one foot in thickness. These beds 
are followed on the east by Dfvonian and Sub-Carboniferous strata. 

NOTE. The Knox Shale and Knox Dolomite of Prof. Safford extends from Tennessee into Georgia, 
with all the Tennessee characteristics of the groups.

33. Atlanta. The broad belt of METAMORPHIC ROCKS, extending from Maryland to central Ala- 
bama, belongs to the Archaean age. It has the Blue Ridge of Virginia, the Unica of Tennessee, and 
the Blue Mountain of Georgia for its northwestern border. Its southwestern margin is approxi- 
mately defined by the falls and shoals of the rivers at Washington, D. C., at Richmond and Peters- 
burg, Va., at Raleigh, N. C., at Columbia, S. C., at Augusta, Milledgeville and Columbus, Ga., and at 
Opelika and Wetumka, Ala. An air line from Milledgeville, passing near Atlanta to the limit of the 
Blue Ridge rocks, would measure the width of the Archaean belt in Georgia, showing it to be about 
one hundred miles wide. 

The Archaean rocks are recognized in Georgia under only two divisions, 1 a. Laurentian and 1 b. 
Huronian. They constitute the country rocks from Atlanta westward to the margin of Choccolocco 
Valley at Davisville Tunnel, Alabama, 88 miles. The 1 a. Laurentian group consists chiefly of gran- 
ite, gneiss and hard schists ; while the 1 b. Huronian group consists of less metamorphosed beds of 
chlorite micaceous and talcosa schists and slates, and some beds of argillites. Both groups are 
exposed along the railway cuts, but 1 b. Huronian constitutes by far the greater portion of the sur- 
face rock. The hard rocks of the 1 a. Laurentian, however, are exposed to view in the bed of the 
Chattahoochee River, eight miles west of Atlanta, and are quarried a short distance west of the river. 
The Laurentian also occurs, as shown by the Guide, in the excellent granite quarried at Douglas- 
yille, also at Villa Rica. Concord to Douglasville, mica and Hornblende slates and schists with beds 
of granite and gneiss exposed in cuts along railroad. From this point westward to the limit of the 
Archaean rocks in Alabama the beds of the 1 a. Laurentian are but little exposed. 

34. Winston. Corundum has been found in considerable quantities near Powder Springs, in 
Cobb County; also near Villa Rica, Ga., and in Tallapoosa County, Ala. 

35. Villa Rica. The granite beds make their appearance near Villa Rica, where they seem to 
underlie the hornblende schists and slates that carry the copper ores (chalcopy rites) of that region, 
as well a.s the mica schists in which the gold-bearing veins of quartz in the same vicinity are found. 
A belt of copper ore (chalcopyrite) crosses the Georgia Pacific Railway, west of Villa Rica, in Carroll 
County. This ore has been mined to some extent at several points in Douglas, Carroll and Haralson 
Counties. It is transported to Atlanta where the copper is extracted and the sulphur utilized in the 
manufacture of sulphuric acid. The same belt of copper ore continues its southeasterly course into 
Cleburne County, Ala., where the Wood Copper Mines were worked for some years. 

The gold belt of the Atlantic Slope extending from the Potomac in Virginia, and across North 



County, Alabama, and at other points in both States. 

36. Temple. Mica, talc and asbestos are found in Cobb, Douglas and Carroll Counties, Georgia, 
and in Cleburne County, Alabama. Roofing slates and flagging stones have been quarried in Polk 
and Haralson Counties, Georgia, and are found in Cleburne County, Alabama. J. L. A H. D. C. 

37. [From Muscadine to Heflin, metamorphic slates and schists, chloritic and micaceous with some 
gneiss. Southwest of Heflin Station, 14 miles in Cleburne County, are the celebrated Arbacoochee gold 
mines, and 26 miles the Goo, Smith&apos;s and Wood&apos;s copper mines; and in Randolph County, near High 
Snoals, the tin ores lately discovered by Wm. Gesner, Analytical Chemist, Birmingham, Alabama.]

38. Davisville. Scon after passing the tunnel near Davisville, the road leaves the Archaean rocks 
and passes abruptly upon the Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones and slates of the beautiful Choc- 
colocco Valley. These sandstones, slates and limestones, of Cambrian and Lower Silurian age, along 
the southeast margin of the valley, apparently dip under the older Archaean beds,which seems to be due 
to a fault by which the Cambrian rocks have slipped downward, while by an inversion the Archaean 

b eda have been thrown upon them, so as to give a reversed order of superposition. From Davisville

Tunnel the road runs southwest for 12 miles, along the beautiful Choccolocco Valley, passing fre- 
quent cuts through Lower Silurian rocks, the lower portion of which are considerably metamor- 
phosed some of the beds being partially changed to Hydromica slates. Limonite ores are very 
abundant in this valley, are easily mined, and await only capital and labor to make them profitable. 

39. Near Oxford, Calhoun County, the road changes its course northward through a gap of Ladiga 
Mountain, cut by Snow Creek. Here the sandstones and shales of the Potsdam group (2 b.) are ex- 
posed in well defined arches. These rocks constitute the main mass of the Ladiga and Cold Water 
Mountains the ridges which flank the narrow valley in which Oxford and Anniston are situated. 
These ridges are two great stone-waves, between which we find a synclinal trough which holds the 
rich beds of Limonite ores, mined to supply the furnaces at Anniston. Oxford is a good starting 
point for the geological study of this region. 

40. Anniston. From Anniston the railway turns westward and crosses the wide Silurian lime- 
etone valley of the Coosa River, the country rocks of which belong mostly to the Quebec, Chazy, 
and Treriton epochs. J. L.&amp;H. D. C. 

41. Sheddon station is on the western border of the Coosa Valley, upwards of 25 miles wide, 
diagonally as the railway crosses it ; and a little east of Eden Station it passes abruptly into the 
Sub-Carbonifero&apos;us formation of the Coosa, or third or most easterly Alabama coal field. ( W. G.) The 
Coosa Valley is a prolongation of the great Silurian Valley of Virginia and Tennessee, while the Chocco- 
locco and Anniston Valleys on the one side, and the Cahaba and Birmingham Valleys on the other, 
may be regarded as its branches or outliers. The width of the Coosa Valley by the line of the 
Georgia Pacific Railway is 25 miles. Many promising beds of iron ore are found near this line. 
The Coosa Valley is the southern terminus of one of the most interesting and important valleys in 
the World, in a geological view. Tracing the 4 a. Trenton limestone, and the 4 c. Hudson River 
Slate formations from their classical localities, from which they derive their names, Trenton Falls, N. 
Y. (see note 62 of that State), and the Hudson River, we find them in the Mohawk Valley of New 
York, with branches extending far into New England and Canada. Following it southwestward it 
crosses New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania by Easton, Lebanon, Harrisburg, Carlisle and 
Chambersburg, as the Cumberland or Kittatinny Valley, into Maryland, past Hagerstown and through 
Virginia as the Shenandoah or Great Valley, by Winchester and Stanton; and, being divided by the 
Massanutten Mountain, on the east side by Sheperdstown, Luray ? to Roanoke, and into Tennessee, 
where it is the valley of East Tennessee, and finally in Alabama its two divided branches sink and 
disappear beneath the cretaceous plains of the South. In Alabama the Trenton is much less con- 
spicuous than the Canadian group. (3 a. b. c.) J. M. 

42. Eden. [North of this station are the Broken Arrow and Front Creek coal mines, in the 
Coosa coal field. (W. G.) ] A few miles west of Coosa River we find an abrupt transition to the Sub- 
Carboniferous of the Coosa coal field. Near Eden station the road passes through a ridge of Sub- 
Carboniferous limestone, directly upon the highest coal-bearing beds of this region, which dip 
beneath the older Sub-Carboniferous strata. This can be best accounted for on the hypothesis of a 
fault. Sub-Carboniferous fossils are found in this neighborhood in abundance. Promising seams of 
coal are found in this field and have been mined to some extent. The Broken Arrow Wells, valued 
for their mineral waters, are situated in this region. 



GEORGIA AND ALABAMA. 386 



43. Kerr&apos;s Gap. At Kerr&apos;s Gap, where the road passes from the Coosa field into Cahaba Valley, 
the Millstone Grit (here a coarse conglomerate, 80 to 100 feet thick) has a high outcrop on the Coosa 
or Bald Rock Mountain: Dipping beneath this are the Sub-Carboniferous formations, followed by the 
Silurian limestones, all dipping to the southeast. Valuable iron ores and limestones, with one good 
vein of Baryte are found here. Along the western margin of this valley the Silurian limestones nave 
been abruptly cut off&apos; by a fissure, and the coal-bearing beds fl4^ of the Cahaba field have dropped 
down so as to abut against them. The geotogieal structure of this field is very analogus to that of 
the Coosa field both apparently monoclines, limited by faults along their eastern margins. Valuable 
coal mines have been opened here. 

44. [O&apos;JSorr&apos;8 Gap is in the western boundary of the Seconder Cahaba coal field of Alabama; and 
as this railway crosses the Big or West Cahaba River, at Sycamore Ford, and keeps the face of its 

rn bluff a considerable distance, a good view of the strata of shales, sandstone, and some of 
the Cahaba coal beds can be seen from the cars.] (W. G.) 

45. Red Gap. The road passes from Sub-Carboniferous of Cahaba field into the Birmingham 
{or Jones) Valley through Bed Gap, which presents a section of the Clinton group that carries the great 
bed, 30 feet thick, of fossil ore so extensively worked in this part of Alabama. Here the road cuts 
beds that are probably Genesee (10 c.) 

40. Birmingham is a rapidly growing city, in and around which are several large iron furnaces 
and other manufacturing enterprises. Here ores, limestones, coal, and building material are found 
in unusual contiguity and abundance. 

47. Structure of the Alabama Coal Fields. There is good reason to believe that the Cooea, Cahaba 
and Warrior coal fields were originally one common field, which, previous to the Appalachian Revo- 
lution, stretched across the areas that are now ^the Cahaba and Birmingham Valleys. But these 
yjiHeys and their margins are now only the relics of a monoclinal uplift, in the one case, and of an 
irregular anticlinal stone- wrinkle in the other, which were thrust up so high and bent so sharply as 
to fracture, not only the coal-bearing strata on top, but also the underlying Sub-Carboniferous and 
Clinton beds and many of the Silurian limestones that now form the bottoms of the valleys. 



4-J. When this railway has been extended westward from Coal burg until it meets its western 
ision, now under construction east of Aitesia on the Mississippi&amp;Ohio Railway, it will traverse 
the Great Warrior coal field over its most productive portions. Between this coal field and the Mis- 



sissippi it will cross a wide belt of timber, cotton and corn lands. The line will intersect every geo- 
logical formation found in the Southern States, from the Archaean, at Atlanta, up to the Quaternary, 
and must always be an interesting route for scientific travellers. J. L.&amp;H. D. C.

Notes on the Geological Formations of Mississippi. 

Brief descriptions of some formations peculiar to the Southern States seem to be required. 
Mississippi is a Tertiary and Cretaceous State, by far the greater portion of it being occupied by 
the former, if we leave out of consideration the strata of the Orange Sand, which undoubtedly forms the 
greater portion of the actual surface. These formations have been well studied and described by 
Professor Eug. W. Hilgard, from whose reports the following brief descriptions of the several sub- 
divisions have been taken. 
2O Quaternary. 

20 e. Alluvial Deposits. These include all the soils, first bottom deposits, and sand bars now 
in process of formation, or attributable to causes now in action. The lower bottoms of the Mis- 
sissippi River, now frequently overflowed, are bordered by level tracts of land sometimes several 
miles in width, evidently formed in flowing water, but of too high a level to have been formed by 
the present river and being probably due to ancient glacial rivers. 

20 d. Yellow Loam. The yellow, brown, or reddish loam forms the surface and furnishes the 
soils of the greater portion of the State of Mississippi, and is the source of its wealth as a great 
cotton-growing State. Professor Hilgard thinks it was an independent acqueous deposit pos- 
terior to the Bluff and Orange Sand, and anterior to the alluvial formations of the present epoch. Its 
prevalent character is that of a yellow clay or loam, without any definite structure or cleavage, vari- 
ously tinged with iron, and it forms the best upland soils and sub-soils of the State, averaging about 
three feet in thickness, and sometimes twenty feet. 

20 c. The Bluff, or Loess, of Mississippi, or cane-hills belt, presents the same remarkably uni- 
form features as in other States and in all parts of the world, as described in the introduction to 
this volume. It consists of a fine silt, almost too silicious to be called a loam, of a grayish or yel- 
lowish buff tint. A certain degree of firmness is imparted to the mass, caused as Professor Hilgard 
thinks, by rough, irregular concretions, varying in size from fine sand grains to the weight of several 
pounds, (Loess puppets), into which the fine material has been cemented by earthy carbonates. 
Hence, it is little subject to erosion, maintains itself readily in even vertical cuts, and valleys cut in- 
to it have steep slopes, at times almost vertical walls.* Its thickness is sometimes as much as sev- 
enty feet, but it shows only obscure marks of stratification. Its fossils are terrestrial snails and 
quadrupeds. 

20 b. Port Hudson. This is a formation consisting, in its landward portion chiefly of paludal, mostly- 
dark-tinted and well stratified calcareous clays, often overlaid by brownish ill stratified loams, which 
intervene between it and the Loess proper. Its chief fossils are a fresh water and land fauna, among^ 
many vegetable remains, including cypress stumps. To seaward the beds become more brackish 
and finally of purely marine character. It underlies the Mississippi alluvium at least as far as Mem- 

E&apos;lis, rises into &quot; Crowley&apos;s Ridge,&quot; in Arkansas and Southeast Missouri, and also underlies the Red 
iver alluvium to Shreveport. It is most widely developed in Louisiana. 

20 a. The Orange Sand, or stratified drift, is an important formation. It covers nearly the whole 
State of Mississippi, except the alluvial bottoms of the river, being, however, itself often covered by 
the later formations above described. It forms the main body of most of the ridges of the State, and to a 
great extent their surface. It gives character to the surface conformation, which, contrary to the popu- 
lar impression, is generally hilly back from the river, though nowhere mountainous. All the sandy 
hills seen from the railroad, from 30 to 120 feet high, few of them as high as 400 feet, which are con- 
spicuous features in the landscape, are due to the Orange Sand formation, out of which the hills have 
been formed by denudation of the valleys and lower ground. The sand of which it is chiefly com- 

* In Science, for August, 1884, I maintained that the steep slopes of the Loess were owing to ita 
laminated structure, like the Genesee, and other shales. . J.I.

posed is in color of an orange yellow, sometimes very deep and glaring, but more frequently it is a 
dull rust color; in some places of a delicate rose color, with frequentlylsright yellow tints, and there 
are some deposits of white sand. There are, of course, an endless variety of intermediate tints, and 
sometimes crimson, purple and almost blue tints are observed. It also contains extensive gravel 
beds, usually forming belts of a general north and south direction ; and irregular beds and bands of 
clayey materials are common where clayey formations underly. Its origin is not yet clearly ascertained, 
but it appears very much like a glacial river deposit, the materials being mainly derived from places 
south of the Ohio River on either side of the Mississippi. As the Mississippi must have been the 
great outlet of the vast glacial rivers of the age of ice, it is not to be supposed that it would leave no

traces of that period behind in some of the States on its borders. There is no doubt the deposition 
of the orange sand took place in flowing water, whose current had a general direction from north to 
south. This formation is 40 to 60 feet thick ; 100 feet ]is not unusual, and even 200 feet. It contains 
the fossils of the underlying formations, but none of its own. Th materials are non-calcareous and 
peroxidized throughout; highly ferruginous, and in part silicious sandstones form limited deposits, 
very frequently capping hills and ridges which have thus been preserved from erosion, profoundly 
influencing the surface conformation. 
19. Later Tertiary. 

19 f. The Grand Gulf. The highest Tertiary formation apppearing on the surface of the State is 
the Grand Gulf group of blue, green and white, compact clays, and mostly soft whitish sandstones 
overlying the same. No fossils save a few leaves and small lignite beds have been found in it, 
although it occupies, in the southern part of the state, the large area covered by the long leaved pine. 
It is supposed to be of Miocene age. 
19. Tertiary. 

19 e. Vicksburg Miocene, the highest of the marine tertiary formations, occupies a narrow belt of 
nearly uniform width, extending across the State to the Tombigbee River in Alabama, and it con- 
tains a valuable crystalline limestone, associated, however, with blue and white marls and important 
beds of lignite, but the chief material is a soft white limestone. 

19 d. Jackson. The territory of this group is characterized by the occurrence of the black prairie 
soil en its surface, and also of bald prairies, both very similar to those of the Rotten Limestone 
region. The material is either a soft yellowish limestone or indurated marl or a soft gray or yellowish 
calcareous clay, in which the large bones of the Zeuglodon are found. 

19 c. Claiborne. This group of blue and white calcareous marls occupies but a small area in the 
state, its fossils are poorly preserved, and it imparts no obvious features to the surface of the country 
underlaid by it. 

19 b. Burstone. (&quot; Silicious Claiborne,&quot; of Hilgard&apos;s Mississippi report). This group forms a wide 
and to northward ill-defined belt, northward of the Claiborne and Jackson area. Its materials are 
mostly soft yellowish or whitish sandstones and claystones, alternating with dark-tinted lignito-gypse- 
ous clays and sands ; sometimes unconsolidated fossiliferous sands and silicious sandstone of the 
&quot; burstone &quot; character ; also, highly ferruginous clays. Northward it passes insensibly -into

19 a. La Grange or Lignite (&quot; Northern Lignitic &quot; of Hilgard), which underlies all of the northern part 
of the state outside of the Cretaceous area, itself mostly covered by the Orange Sand. It consists of 
mostly dark-tinted shaly clays, interstratified with gray sands and lignite beds of some economic im- 
portance ; shows a few marine outliers showing near relation to the Burstone, or more probably to the 
* Woods Bluff&quot; beds of Alabama, the base of the Eocene Tertiary. 
18. Cretaceous. 

18 d. Ripley Group is composed of hard crystalline limestone, the highest strata and bluish 
micaceous marls more or less sandy below. The country suddenly becomes hilly and broken as you 
enter this formation. It is a hard, sandy limestone, with strata of blue shale marl&apos;between, and one of 
heavy gray calcareous clay on top. 

18 c. The Rotten Limestone is an important formation 700 to 1,000 feet thick in the southwest, and 
thinning down in the northeast to 70 to 100 feet at the Tennessee line. The material is of great uni- 
formity, a soft, chalky rock of a white or pale bluish tint, with a very little sand. When the rotten 
limestone appears on the surface it appears white or yellowish white, and preserves the same tint 
from 2 to 18 feet deep. Below that it is often bluish gray, which, when wet, looks quite dark. These 
white clay marls or soft limestone form a level or gently undulating surface with a heavy calcareous 
soil in the Prairie Region proper, and comprises some of the best land in the State. 

18 b. Tombigbee sand has as its prevalent material a fine grained micaceous sand, usually of a 
greenish tint, but not unfrequently gray, bluish, black, yellow, and sometimes even orange red. The 
region is hilly and sandy and the soil generally inferior. 

18 a. Eutaic. The territory occupied by this formation offers no striking characteristics in Mis- 
sissippi, by far the larger portion of it being covered thickly by the Orange Sand. It consists of un- 
consolidated sands and dark-tinted clays. 

14. The Sub-Carboniferous occupies a very small territory in the northeastern section of the 
State adjoining Alabama, and its geological relations can hardly be satisfactorily studied in Missis- 
sippi. 

The Cretaceous and Tertiarv formations of Mississippi are rich in fossils and afford favorite local- 
ities for thf paleontologist. The geology of Mississippi may become important in the study of the 
vast, almost unknown region U-twen the Mississippi River and the Sierra Nevada, where the same 
formations seem to prevail. In this connection see Mr. Loughridge&apos;s notes on the Indian Territory 

The foregoing descriptions of the sub-divisions of the Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary 
apply to these formations in the adjoinina States of Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana, J. M.

General Geological Note on Louisiana. 

Louisiana is not wholly alluvial, as is the general impression ; only about one-half of the State, 
in fact, belonging to the alluvium of the Mississippi and Red Kivers and to the marsh region of the 
coast. A considerable portion of this, too, is older than the present river channels. Such is the 
case with the greater part of the &quot; buck-shot &quot; soils, where certain strata of dark colored clay come 
to the surface. These qlays underlie the entire plain from the Gulf coast as high as Memphis and 
Shreveport at depths of from one to forty feet, and are the older portions of the Champlain formation, 
most definitely exhibited at Port Hudson Bluff, 20 b. 

Next above and north of these prairies occur the beds of sand and gravel belonging to the 
&quot; Stratified Drift,&quot; capping the higher ridges all over the upland portion of the State. It is the 20 a. 
Orange Sand. 

The next formation is the 19 f. &quot;Grand Gulf &quot;.group of the Tertiary formation, blue, green and 
white clays, clay stones and clay sandstones, rising into high ridges as we advance northward, and 
forming a prominent hilly belt across the State. 

Northward, again, of this transverse ridge we find a narrow belt of the calcareous marls and lime- 
stones of the Marine Tertiary, 19 e. Vicksburg and 19 d. Jackson groups approaching the surface. 

In northwestern Louisiana fossiliferous rocks, mostly ferruginous and red, or sometimes calca- 
reous of Upper 19 c. Claiborne or Lower 19 d. Jackson of Tertiary age, are found and known as the 
Red Lands. The upper portion of the ridges is composed of or capped by the irregularly bedded 
sands of the 20 b. Stratified Drift. 

See the descriptions of the formations in the Mississippi chapter. From E. W. Hilgard&apos;s Cotton 
Report.

892 AN AMERICAN GEOLOGICAL RAILWAY GUIDE. (FLORIDA.) 

Florida 1 



General No.e on the Geology of Florida. 

The first intimation given to the scientific world of the true geology Of Florida was by 
Dr. Eugene A. Smith in his report upon the &quot;Soils of the Cotton Region&quot; in Vol. VI. of the U. 8. 
Census of 1880. The western, northern and middle highland regions mostly occupied his attention. 
To him is due the discovery that the oldest rocks of the Peninsula are of the division of the- 
Eocene, known in Alabama and Mississippi as the Vicksburg Formation. In 1885, the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey prosecuted some work in Florida, principally for the collection of Tertiary fossils, 
and the observations there made, so far as published, (see Article in &quot;The American Journal of 
Science,&quot; October, 1888, by L. C. Johnson,) show that the Eocene Axis is quite narrow, and not 
manifest by outcrops further south than Sumter County ; by some of its effects it is traceable to- 
Polk County. It is the basis of the &quot; Interior Basin.&quot; The next and the most extensive develop- 
ment was called the &quot; Waldo,&quot; from the place where the most abundant and decisive fossils wer&amp;found. This has proved to be Miocene. Most of the phosphatic rocks belong to it. It is also the 
basis of the Lake region and of the &quot; High Hummocks.&quot; It reaches the &quot; Trail Ridge &quot; and high- 
lands of the eastern slope, and occupies the western slope to the Gulf as far south as Tampa. 

The greater part of the St. John&apos;s River country is Pliocene, with much that is even later., 
The Jacksonville Formation, exposed at the water works, has been assigned to the Pliocene ; while 
the &quot;eoc&amp;ina&quot; of St. Augustine and the marls of Indian River belong, probably all of them, to Post 
Pliocene times. The phosphatic rocks of Black Creek and of Enterprise perhaps on insufficient 
grounds are supposed to belong to the Jacksonville Formation. 

In 1887 ? Prof. Angelo Heilpnn, in a &quot;Report of a Visit to the Southwest of Florida&quot; decided 
the formations at Tampa to be Miocene, south of that, as far as explored and definitely settled by- 
fossils, Pliocene. The actual coast and coral reefs and islands must be later. 

The underlying limestones in many sections of the state have been dissolved in an irregular 
and often fantastic manner, producing sink holes, underground channels and numerous ponds and 

The soils on the immediate surface of the country consist mainly of such sands as would be- 
left by a receding ocean. In some places these are drifted into dunes, such as the high &quot;Trail 
Ridge &quot;and its continuations east, and the lower sand dune hills westward, which overlook the 
Hummock region, and separate it from the &quot;Interior Basin.&quot; Probably the clays and &quot;red lands&apos;* 
generally are derived, by disintegration and leaching from Miocene rocks. The interior &quot; High 
Hummocks&quot; are Miocene, or a few to the north Eocene, and the &quot;Low Hummock&quot; of the coast 
Pliocene or later. 

The elevations of the highest ridges seldom exceed two hundred feet, whilst the Interior Basin 
and highest of the hills of the western region are not often much over one hundred feet, while the 
lower part of the state, south of Polk County, has an average elevation of only about thirty to forty 
feet above low tide.

1. By Mr. Lawrence C. Johnson of Meridian, Miss., Assistant Geologist U. S. Geological Survey. 
The survey of the state was not completed by Mr. Johnson when he ceased work in that field, for 
which reason, or because the superficial deposits render the boundaries of the formations uncer- 
tain, he assigns many of the stations with a ?, denoting the probable formation.

1. By John R. Proctor, Director of the Kentucky Geological Survey. 

2. The geological survey is in progress, and the formations of the State not fully determined. 

3. Louitville, the metropolis of Kentucky, very interesting to the geologist At this point the 
Ohio River falls 23 feet over ledge of Corniferous and Niagara limestone. Allow water the limestone 
is exposed over a wide area, and discloses the finest collecting ground for corals in this country. 
Several large collections of Devonian and Upper Silurian corals are owned in Louisville. 

5. Cincinnati. As to ancient glacial dam at Cincinnati, see Note 62 Ohio, 76 Indiana, 62 West 
Virginia. G. F. WEIGHT. 

6. Bagdad. About six miles to the south of this place can be seen an isolated hill capped with 
Niagara limestone. This hill is about 1,250 feet above the level of the sea, and the Niagara is found 
here at a greater elevation than elsewhere in the State. 

7. Benson. In descending the hill to Benson the road passes through the Middle Hudson. 

8. Frankfort. Hills around Trenton, the Birdseye limestone reaches up the bank of the Ken- 
tucky River as high as the tunnel. Good collecting ground for Trenton fossils. 

9. Springs Station. Near here are some of the most celebrated stock farms. They are on the 
(4 c.) Lower Hudson River formations. 

10. Payne 1 *. Stage from here to Georgetown passes through some of the most beautiful lands of 
the Blue Grass region. 

11. Colest-urg. This place is at the base of Muldrow&apos;s Hill, the road ascends this hill between 
this point and filizabethtown. This hill extends around central Kentucky, from the mouth of Salt 
Biver on the west to Lewis County on the east, retaining for its entire length the same geological 
formations, viz.: Black shales (10 c.) at base, and Waverly sandstones and shales (13 a.), and Upper 
Sub-Carboniferous limestone (13 b.) In Madison County the hill attains its greatest height (1,650 feet 

-above sea), where it is capped with the Carboniferous conglomerate, having a workable bed of sub- 
conglomerate coal. The Chester (13 c.) is also present in this portion of the hill. It is there known 
as Big Hill. Muldrow&apos;s hill represents the retreating escarpment of the rocks formerly extending 
over central Kentucky. Siliceous remains of these Palaeozoic rocks have been found scattered over 
the uplands of central Kentucky, and have been by some erroneously classed as glacial drift. 

\2. Elizabethtvum. County town of Hardin County. St. Louis Group of sub-Carboniferous 
limestone. 

13. Mumfardsville. County town of Hart County. The road crosses Green River at this point. 
The high hill on south side of river is capped with Chester sandstone, as are also the hills to the left 
of road between Cave City and Glasgow Junction. 

14. Glasgow Junction. Branch road to Glasgow. This is the nearest station to Mammoth Cave. 
Several beautiful caverns in this neighborhood. All of these caverns are in the St. Louis limestone, 
and some of them reach up to the Chester sandstone which caps the hills seen to the north of the 
road from this point to Bowling Green, 41 miles, all the drainage being subterranean. 

15. B&apos;jwling Green. County seat of Warren County. Road crosses the Big Barren River at 
this point. Boats run from here to Evansville, on the Ohio River. 

16. Franklin. County seat of Simpson County. The division between 13 a. and 13 b. is not 
far from this pKce. Geology of county not yet studied in detail. 

17. Hopkintville. County Seat of Christian County. Surrounded with very fertile lands. This 
county produces more wheat and tobacco than any county in the State. The best lands in this and 
adjoining counties are not excelled by any in America. The superior body of land bf ginning near 
Smith&apos;s Grove, in Warren County, and comprising a portion of Warren,&apos; Simpson, Logan, Todd, 
Cnristian, Trigg, Caldwell and Lyon, is the largest body of all good land with which the writer has 
any acquaintance. The Western State Asylum for the Insane is located near Hopkinsville.

56. Argillite. Near site of Old Argillite Furnace, probably the oldest furnace in tne Hanging 
Hock Iron Region, erected in 1822. About three miles east of station is the Pennsylvania Furnace, 
and three miles west the Buffalo Furnace. 

57. Hunnewell. Hunnewell Furnace located here ; also the machine and repair shops of the 
railroad. Mines of No. 3 and No. 4 Coal, the latter known as the Hunnewell Cannel Coal. 

58. Hopewtll. The former site of an old furnace of that name. 
5i&gt;. Pactolus. Tho former site of an old furnace of that name. 

00. Grayson. The county seat of Carter County. Coals No. 2 and No. 3 are found here. Iron 
Hills Furnace, the largest charcoal furnace in this section, is situated about eight miles northwest 
irorn Grayson, where also is the celebrated Lambert Ore Bank, a local deposit 14 feet 10 inches thick, 
of great value. Thirteen miles west of Grayson are the celebrated Carter Caves, situated in the St. 
Louis group of the Sub-Carboniferous limestone. These caves and the wild scenery of Tigart Val- 
ley, surrounding them, are well worth visiting. 

61. ML Savage. Near here is Mt. Savage Furnace, and fine veins of coals No. 3 and No. 7, the 
latter known as the Coalton Coal. 

62. Willard. At Willard are the ores and coal mines of the Bellefonte&amp;Etna Company of Iron- 
ton, Chio. Most of the coals are represented in this vicinity. 

63. Peach Orchard, Extensive mines, Coal No. 3. 

64. Wiekliffe. County *eatof Ballard County. The railroad just south of this passes at the foot 
-of an exposure of lignite three feet thick. 

65. Columbus. The town lies at the foot of river bluffs, 120 feet high, showing Quaternary and 
Tertiary strata. Port Hudson clays exposed beneath Alluvium in river bank at low water. 

The Quaternary gravel an,d brown loam beds, that cover almost the entire region lying between 
the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers, are very generally underlaid by black and blue clays of the 



lignitic group of Eocene Tertiary. These clays have, in and near Paducah, been penetrated to a 
depth of 100 feet. Cretaceous sands and clays underlie the Quaternary thirty-five miles southeast 
of Mayfield. 



Errata for Kentucky. 

In note 20 and 21. The first line of 21 belongs to 20, Henderson. 

In note 4(5, Paducah. Cprniferous conglomerate should be Carboniferous conglomerate. 

In the Chesapeake, Ohio fe Southwestern R. R. the geological formation of Calvert City 
Paducah should be &quot;20. Quaternary, Port Hudson.&quot; That of Boaz, et al., to Fulton, should be &quot;20. 
Quaternary gravel and loam over Eocene Tertiary.&quot; 

The elevation of Princeton should be 524 ; Calvert city, 361 ; and Paducah, 341 feet. The same 
error effects the elevations of all stations south of Paducah and east to Elizabethtown.

1. Revised, and the notes added by Prof. James M. SafFord, the State Geologist of Tennessee, and 
the portion in Kentucky by Prof. N. S. Shaler, the State Geologist of Kentucky. 

2. Memvhis. The Bluff loam is well displayed in the bluffs at Memphis, 



Memphis, no other formations 



appearing, excepting in very low water. 

Vicksburg. The peculiar property of the Loess, or Bluff formation is shown in the following pas- 
sage from General Grant&apos;s article on the Siege of Vicksburg, in the Century magazine, for September, 



1885: &quot; The ridges upon which Vicksburg is built, and those back to the Big Black, are composed of 
a deep, yellow clay, 01 great tenacity. When roads and streets are cut through, perpendicular banks 
are left, and stand as well as if composed of stone. The magazines of the enemy were made by 
mining passageways into this clay, at places where there were deep cuts. Many citizens secured 
places of safety for their families by carving out rooms in these embankments. A door-way, in these 
cases would be cut in a high bank, starting from the level of the road, or street, and after mining it 
in a few feet a room of the size required would be carved out of the clay, the dirt being removed by 
the door-way. In some instances I saw where two rooms were cut out for a single family, with a 
door-way in the clay wall separating them; some of these were carpeted, and furnished with consider- 
able elaboration. In these the occupants were fully secure from the shells of the enemy, which were 
dropped into the citv night and day, without intermission.&quot; A lady who was in the city during the 
siejre, reported the hills as honey-combed with caves, the digging of which became a regular busi- 
iney were well propped with thick posts, as in a coal mine.

crosses the 10 c. Black Shale, also 7. Helderberg, 5 d. Niagara, 4 a. Lebanon, 4 b. Nashville, and 3 c. Knox 
Dolomite strata, which have been brought to the surface by an uplift. The only exposure of Knox 
Dolomite in Tennessee west of the Cumberland Mountains. In the bluff on the river just below Cum- 



berland are good presentations of the lOc. Black Shale, as well as the 5 Niagara, and 7. Helderberg rockfl. 
. Paris. At the Paris depot the Orange Sand is well seen in the railroad cuts, and in the washes 
t the town. In the cuts of the railroad just east of the depot, and also on roads leading to the 



oatheut from the town, the Flatwoods clay can be observed to advantage. 
5. At this Tunnel is a good section of the (10 c.) Black Bhale, with the

9. At Newsom&apos;s a section may be conveniently seen extending from the upper part of the 4 b. 
Nashville to the 13. sub-carboniferous. 

10. Camden. Half a mile west of Camden depot the railroad crosses &quot;the old shore line and 
passes from the ancient Paleozoic strata on to the Tertiary and Quaternary ones, the limestones, 
cherts, etc., disappearing, and the softer sands and clays takng their place. 

11. At Tracy City is a good bed of coal, extensively mined. In this vicinity a good section of 
the coal measures of this part of Tennessee can be obtained. (See &quot; The Coal Regions of America,&quot; 
pages 351 to 37:5. 

12. Within a few miles of these Stations are ridges and knobs made up of dark shales of Cincin- 
nati or Nashville age. At Johnson&apos;s a point of one of these ridges is very near the Station. 

13. The high mountains so conspicuous from the depot at Greeneville are made up of 2 b. Chil- 
howee (Potsdarn) sandstone, and of a 2 a. Ocoee slates and conglomerates. 

14. Veins of zinc ore are found at this point in the 3 c. Knox dolomite.

west of depot. On the side of the Hols ton River opposite Knoxville high knobs covered with dee] 
red soil are conspicuous, which are made up in good part of a dark ferruginous limestone, called Iroi 
Limestone, and which belong! to the 4 b. Naahville (Cincinnati) group. 
16. Lenoin. Depot on junction of the Lenoir or Chazy limestone and the Enox dolomite. Th 
former lies to the southeast, and the latter to the northwest 
17. About one mile east of Ooltawah the railroad passes through a jjap of the White Oak Moun 
tatn.s in which is an interesting section embracing 4 b. Nashville, 5 d. Niagara, Devonian (10 c. Blacl 
Shale) and 13 Sub-Carboniferous rocks. 
18. From Knoxville to Cane Creek the stations are either on the Enoz divisions or the Trenton. 
19. Elk Valley is on a fault, and in the upper part of the narrow valley the Trenton, the re&lt;Clinton ore, the Sub-Carboniferous limestone, and the Coal Measures may be seen and studied. 
20. Although Professor Safford knows the geology of the country passed over, he has not travelec 
on this railroad, and therefore the sub-divisions of the Lower Silurian are not given. From Rockwoo&lt;to Chattanooga the stations are mostly on his Knox divisions, but in a few cases on Trenton.

Arkansas. 



GENERAL GEOLOGY OP THE STATE. Dividing the State diagonally from northeast to southwest, 
beginning near the easterly boundary of Randolph county and running thence past Grand Glaise and 
Little Rock, through to Fulton in Hempstead county on Red River, (consequently nearly in the line 
of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain&amp;Southern Railroad), almost all the State, east of said line, will be 
found of the 19. Tertiary formation, except along the river bottoms, where it is 20. Quaternary. The 
northern portion, west of said line, is mostly 2-8. Silurian, with some 9-12. Devonian and 14. Carbon- 
iferous further south ; the middle western part of the State being 14. Carboniferous, while the south- 
west part (namely, from Arkadelphia and Murfreesboro south and west) will be found 18. Cretaceous. 

In consequence of the above general arrangement of the geological formations in the State, it 
will be readilv perceived that the St. Louis, Iron Mountain&amp;Southern Railroad runs mainly near 
the junction between the Silurian, Carboniferous and Cretaceous of the west side, and the 19. Ter- 
tiary, with some 30. Quaternary, of the east side. Further, that the Arkansas Midland is chiefly in the 
19. Tertiary and 20. Quaternary, while the Little Rock&amp;Fort Smith Railroad passes through the 14. 
Carboniferous formation; also, that the Memphis&amp;Little Rock Railroad runs through 19. Tertiary 
and 20. Quaternary. 

The State affords abundance of manganese, zinc and kaolin. 

The expression, &quot;Quaternary over Silurian,&quot; is intended to indicate that the superficial deposits 
of the locality, opposite which the remark is placed, are Quaternary ; but that when lower formations 
are exposed by denudation, Ac., they would be found Silurian. A similar interpretation is designed 
to be given to &quot; Tertiary over Cretaceous,&quot; and the like expressions. R. 0.

408 AN AMERICAN GEOLOGICAL RAILWAY GUIDE. (IND. TER.) 



Indian Territory. 



The list of Formations is at the head of the Texas Chapter. 

Geology of Indian Territory. The eastern part of the^Indian Territory ia made up almost 
entirely of the representative sandstones, limestones, etc., of the Coal Measures, the former rock 
capping &quot;the mountains of the east, and becoming the prevailing feature in the lower hills and country 
westward, while the limestone which appears prominently in the mountain sides and valleys of the 
east, disappears almost entirely in the west, or is exposed only in the beds of the largest streams. 
Carboniferous coal mines are extensively worked on the south of the Canadian river, by companies 
who have leased them from the Nation. The Permian is said to cover an area south of the Wichita 
Mountains on the southwest, while the remainder of the western part of the Territory is thought to 
belong to the Triassic and Jurassic, except the regions of the mountains which are of granitic struct- 
ure, their granites flesh colored, and associated with greenstone, quartz, porphyry, etc. Dr. R. H.

5. Whitesboro. The belt of Lower Cross Timbers is crossed between this and Denton. 

6. Arlington. Lower Cross Timbers a belt of sandy land, 10 to 15 miles wide, timbered with 
post oak, and reaching from within the Indian Territory southward to the Brazos near Waco. 

7. Weatherford. Upper Cross Timbers similar in many respects to the lower belt with which it 
is united on the north of Red River, but is wider, more irregular in outline, and interspersed with 
high Cretaceous prairie outliers. It reaches southward from Red River along the western border of 
the Cretaceous, and crosses the Brazos nearly to the Colorado River. 

8. Big Springs. Llano Estacado, or the Staked Plain, lying north of this road, is a district of 
75,000 square miles in Northwestern Texas, besides the portion in New Mexico, and is a vast and level 



mit in every direction, not a sign of vegetation upon them, nothing but sand piled upon sand. 

9. -San Antonio. About 80 miles northwest or this place and 18 north of Fredericksburg, in Gil- 
lespie County, is a granite hill called Enchanted Rock, a huge granite and iron formation about eight 
hundred feet high, covering at its base several acres of space, its top being about four hundred yards 
square. Its name is derived from its magnificent appearance, for when the sun shines upon it in the 
morning and at evening, it resembles a huge mass of burnished gold. The Azoic rocks found in this 
central part of the State are mostly of the pink feldspathic variety, resist disintegration, and form 
high andprominent points or hills throughout the region. 

10. Fort Worth and Cleburne. The Lower Cross Timber Belt passes east of town. Professor E. 
P. Whitfield says, Fort Worth is an excellent locality for Cretaceous fossils. 

11. Pecos. Dr. R. H. Loughridge, in his U. S. Census Cotton Report, describes the several chains 
of almost treeless mountains m Western Texas, west of the Pecos River, as largely granite, with ac- 
companying sandstones and limestones. In some of the mountains characteristic eruptive rocks are 
reported as penetrating the later formations, and rising above them in huge masses or forming ver- 
tical columns, as in the Organ Mountains near El Paso. 

12. Sierra Blanca. The great mountain ranges consist, first, next the Pacific coast, and lying from 
ten to two hundred miles distant from it, the Cordelleras or Coast range, and second the Sierra Ne- 
vada, for which see the California chapter. The third is an irregular ill-defined chain, the Sierra 
Madre, and at El Paso we encounter the western flank of the fourth great mountain chain, the 
Rocky Mountains, which terminate in what is called the Organ Mountain. Going east from El Paso,

following the river, we encounter two other ranges of mountains at intervals of about eighty miles, 
called the Eagle Springs or Sacramento Mountains, and the Limpia or Gaudalupe Mountains, in pasts- 
ing through which the river forms a series of caflons (see Note 16). On the Mexican side of the river 
all these mountains arise again, and expand in width and height and attain a great elevation. 

13. El Paso is justly considered one of the garden spots of the interior of the continent. The 
climate is dry, but the settlements are irrigated by water from the river by means of a dam and canal 
and are not dependent on rains for their fertility. The place is more than two hundred years old, the 
settlement having t&gt;een commenced about 1680, when the Spaniards were driven from New Mexico 
by the Indians. It is situated in a charming valley, the Rio del Norte having escaped the mountain 
passes, here runs in an open fertile plain, stretching out along the river to the length ot many miles, 
all the houses surrounded by gardens, orchards and vineyards, and rich settlements, the result of 
judicious irrigation, with cornfields as far as the eye can trace the stream lining its gretc banks. 
Such a scene will always be attractive, but to a traveler who has passed over the lonesome plains it 
appears &apos;.ike an oasis in the desert. The mountains southwest of the town consist almost entirely 01

limestone, below which at the foot of the mountain are horizontal layers of compact quartzore sand- 
stone, such as underlie the basaltic and granitic rock for several hundred miles in the prairie toward i 
Santa Fe, and granitic and porphyritic rock seem to a small extent to have burst through the lime- 
stone and over-Town it. A. W. 

The Carboniferous limestone is supposed to underlie the whole extent of the country of the 
southwest, where the Cretaceous and Tertiary appear on the surface. Although of Carboniferous age 
it is not coal-bearing, being a marine deposit. An ocean existed in the Far West during the Carbon- 
iferous period, and the conditions were never such as to admit of the deposit of such materials as 
form coal beds. All the coal west of Kansas and Indian Territory is Cretaceous. 

14. Martin. Cretaceous rotten limestone forms the Brazos Falls, five miles south. 

15. Pecos River. On the Mexican side, five miles south of the river, is a singular peak called the 
Picotena, rising abruptly from amid the surrounding limestone ranges, shooting up a sharp conical 
peak of basaltic structure. This peak, by its height and external features, presents a most striking 
landmark. It is the most northern outlier of an extensive igneous development of the mountain 
range, rising in jagged peaks to Alpine heights, and presenting in the forest growth which clothes 
its sides agreeable features of verdure, contrasting strangely with the river valley and its bare out- 
line of desert hills. 

16. Sanderson. The river canons. Although the railroad, to shorten distance and for a better 
route, diverges from the river far to the northward, cutting off the great bend, yet the traveler may 
wish to know something of the general character of the river valley forming the Mexican boundary. 
The Rio Grande, from El Paso to the mouth of the Pecos River, south of Langtry station, is charac- 
terized by extensive canons. The river presents a series of basins, more or less extensive, with 
descending steps and then a canon. The scenery is unsurpassed for singularity and grandeur. 
Seventy miles below El Paso, south of Sierra Blanca, the Eagle Springs Mountains converge, and the 
river makes its way through them in deeply cut chasms, exposing the geological structure in sec- 
tional faces presented by its precipitous walls. At the gigantic canon of San Carlos twenty miles 
long, the river presents unbroken walls of limestone, from 200 to a perpendicular height of 1,500 feet. 
A faint conception only can be formed of the truly awful character of the chasm, which in ascending 
begins 85 miles and ends 105 miles above the mouth of the Pecos River, and is far from the railroads. 
Another, the San Vincente canon, is below the great bend to the northward of the Rio Grande, and 
equals the San Carlos in many places in ruggedness and grandeur. These canons were reported by 
Lieut. Emory to be among the most remarkable features on the face of the globe, namely, a river 
traversing at an oblique angle a chain of lofty mountains and making through these on a gigantic 
scale, what in Spanish-America is called a eaflon, that is, a river hemmed in by vertical walls. The 
river is from 80 to 300 feet wide, and at a few points narrows down to 25 or 30 feet, where of course it 
H very deep and rapid. Rep. Mex. Boundary Com.

Quaternary. Their origin will be a matter of doubt until their extent northward is fully ascertained.

MEXICO. 415 



GENERAL NOTE ON THE GEOLOGY OF MEXICO. 



As long ago as 1830, William Maclure, the father of American geology, visited Mexico ord re- 
ported in the American Journal of Science, that &quot;the regular order of original stratification was BO 
much deranged throughout that country by the intimate and frequent alternations of volcanic rocks, 
as to have subverted the original order of nature, and to have changed the class every mile. This 
leaves the geologist in doubt concerning the sub-strata, and would reduce most of his investigations 
to hypothetical results.&quot; In the previous year, probably the same observer reported in the same 
journal : &quot; Lava, volcanic tufa, trachyte, clay-slate and a little granite, with porphyry, are predominant 
rocks in Mexico. Volcanic tufa, trachyte and lava form about ninety-nine hundredths of the country. 
It affords an extensive field of volcanic rocks, none of which appear to be recent, nor is there any 
volcano in activity.&quot; His travels may have only extended from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico. 

Not being able to procure a detailed report of the geology along the lines of the several Mexican 
railroads, such general information is here given as to some localities as could be collected from the 
reports of travelers, and in attempting this, some valuable and unexpected contributions have been 
received from some of the Pennsylvania geologists, rendering important aid in an almost hopeless 
task. The reader is also referred to the notes on Texas as to the formations found along the United 
States and Mexican boundary, which, together with what is given in the chapters on New Mexico and 
California, will throw some light on the great table-land of Mexico, now traversed by the Mexican 
Central and other railroads. Also, see the General Note on the Geology of the Far West. 

In Mexico the altitudes are an interesting study. At the United States and Mexican boundary the 
lowest depression of the great table-lamd occurs, but even that is nearly 4,000 feet above the sea. North 
of this it ascends again even in the valley to 7.000 feet, and near the 49th parallel it is again depressed. 
South of the boundary line the plateau rises rapidly to the table-land of Mexico, where the 
mountains assume a loftier amd more rugged and diversified appearance than on the Texas side. In 
the more northern portions of Mexico the deposits in the valleys seem to be Tertiary ; and farther 
south they are probably the sams, and from the prevalence of volcanic deposits portions of them 
may be metamorphosed. We hare no reports of the Cretaceous. The mountains show surprising 
developments of Carboniferous limestone, and of Huronian and Laurentian formations. Probably 
they are an extension or repetition of the granitic, porphyritic, basaltic and other eruptive rocks, and 
of the Carboniferous limestone of our far Western States and Territories, and the latter of very great 
thickness. Any differences which Mexico may discover, will probably be such as the more recent 
and more extensive volcanic action, and an enlargement of some of the formations would produce. 
There is a boundless field for geologists in Mexico, the country is being made accessible by railroads, 
and there is a charm about the unknown which imparts an interest to that which, when known, may 
perhaps be neither interesting nor very important. At present there is surprisingly little generally 
known about the geology of Mexico, and this chapter is a first attempt in that direction. It is given 
as founded on imperfect observations. J. M. 

The Great Mountain Table-Land of Mexico. There is scarcely a point on the globe, says 
Humboldt, where the mountains exhibit so extraordinary a formation and magnitude as in Mexico. 
Switzerland is considered a very elevated country, but this opinion is merely founded on the aspect 
of a great number of summits perpetually covered with snow, and disposed in chains parallel to the 
great central chain. The summits of th Alps rise to 12,500 and 15,500 feet, while the neighboring 
plains are not more than 1,300 to 2,000 feet in height. The chain of mountains which forms the vast 
plain of Mexico is the same with that which, under the name of the Andes, runs through all South 
America; but the construction of this chain varies to the north and south of the equator. In the 
Southern Hemisphere the Cordillera is everywhere torn and interrupted by crevices like open fur- 
rows or transverse valleys. The elevated plains of Quito are not to be compared in extent with those 
of Mexico. In Peru the most elevated summits constitute the narrow crest of the Andes; but, in 
Mexico, as shown by the railroad altitudes, even the lowest valleys are from 4,000 to 6 ? 000 feet high, 
and the general altitude of the whole country, except a narrow border on the Atlantic and Pacific 
coasts, is 7,000 to 8,000 feet, and upon this are disposed the high volcanic peaks, less colossal, it is true, 
than the Andes, but still 16,000 to 17,000 feet, and, taken together, there is no such mountain on 
the globe, taking into view its extension northward into the United States. Peru and New Grenada 
contain deep transverse valleys, but in Mexico carriages (or in our day railroad cars) roll on from 
Mexico to Santa Fe, a distance of 1,500 miles, at altitudes of from 4,000 to 8,000 feet. On the whole 
road there are few difficulties for art to surmount, so little is the table-land of Mexico interrupted by 
valleys. 

The Volcanic Mountains. In the part of the great plain of Mexico between the capital and Vera 
Cruz, a group of mountains appears which rivals the most elevated summits of the new continent. It 
is enough to name four of these colossi : Popocatepetl, or Smoke Mountain, 17,716 feet; Iztaccihuatl, 
or White Woman, 15.700 feet; Citlaltepetl, or Orizaba, the Star Mountain, 17,371 feet, and Nauhcam- 
patepetl, or Perote, the Square Mountain, 13,414 feet high, and so called from the form of a small, 
porphyritio rock at the summit. Besides the four volcanic mountains mentioned^ there are the 
Navado de Toluca, the Volcan de Colima, and a modern one, the new Volcan de Jorullo. As a general 
statement we may say that the general level of the whole country being some 7,000 feet above the 
sea, these volcanic cones situated upon it rise 8,000 to 10,000 feet higher. 

The few observations that have been made by geologists are not sufficient to found an opinion upon 
as to the formations composing the core or main body of this vast mountain chain, or whether it is 
uniform throughout. Carboniferous limestone forms the visible portion at many places, and is no 
doubt an important element in its structure. There are other mountains of basalt or trap; others 
are Laurentian and Huronian, and at Mexico and southward are the chains of remarkable extinct 
volcanoes. J. M.

. Much of the superficial formations of this part of Mexico must necessarily be of vol- 
rhe plains and valleys in many places owe their present topography and physical basis 
of the high volcanoes, whose ruins and debris constitute the soil, being volcanic 



* The road also passes through the States of Tlaycala and Mexico, but the boundary lines on the 
railroad are not ascertained. 

1. Vera Cruz. The coast region extending between the beach at Vera Cruz along the Mexican 
Railway to the entrance into the gorges of the high Cordillera at Atoyac, fifty mile.-;, is a low, sandy 
and marshy plain. A. F. BANDELIEB.* 

The 19 b. Loup Fork Miocene, 2000 feet in thickness, has been proved over a territory six miles 
by eighteen, in the State of Hidalgo and the adjoining parts of Vera Cruz, north of this railroad, by 
Professor Edw. D. Cope, who visited the region, and obtained bones and teeth of Tertiary animals. 
Several thin beds of coal occur in it, with shales between, apparently composed of volcanic ash and 
beds of excellent clay. Am. Nat. Mag., 1885. It probably underlies this part of the railroad. (See 
Note 16, by Dr. H. M. Chance, as to the coal beds at Jimulco.) 

2. Jalapa. There is a branch railroad from Vera Cruz to Jalapa, and the table land and mount- 
ains at that place are reported to be principally limestone, doubtless the same with the Carboniferous 
limestone on the Mexican Central Railroad. There are many marble quarries, and some sandstone 
or quartzite. 

3. Atoyac. The Cordillera presents an abrupt dark-green front of lofty mountains, above which 
towers the snow-clad Orizaba. The railway enters the highlands through the narrow and very pictur- 
esque pass of the Atoyac, and the scenery changes. In appalling curves we wind our way upwards 
through groves, along fearful chasms and slopes covered with the most luxuriant vegetation of the 
tropics. It is the landscape of the tropics, resting, as it were, on the Southern Alps, where they 
descend towards the plains of Lombardy. The summit of Orizaba rises above the glorious landscape 
of this wonderful region, like a cone of molten silver, in a cloudless sky. A. F. B.

to the wasting of 1 ^ 

detritus or sand. These masses of volcanic debris thin out as they spread eastward to a fertile 
layer of bla^k volcanic soil of a sandy appearance, reaching nearly to the eastern brow of the table- 
land at the Rio Atoyac. A. F. B. 

5. Orizaba. Here the giant, of which glimpses were before obtained, bursts out into full view. 
The railroad at this city is 4,028 feet above tide, and the mountain 17,368 feet, and is twenty-five 
English miles distant to the N. N. E. A. F. B. 

6. Maltrata. From Orizaba, the ascent by the road increases in steepness, and the scenery grows 
correspondingly wilder. The graceful palms gradually disappear, and beyond Maltrata the r]se 
becomes extremely rapid. We are left in doubt as to which should be most admired the sublime 
grandeur of nature, or the remarkable efforts of man to improve every chance, every inch almost, 
for establishing safe, rapid transit. 

7. Boca del Monte. We pass through tunnel after tunnel, until at last Boca del Monte is reached. 
The air blows cool, even chilly; dark pines cover the mountain sides, and on our right towers, in close 
proximity, the summit of the Volcano of Orizaba. Less than nine hours have carried us one hun- 
dred and seven English miles by the railroad, but a horizontal basis of less than fifty miles ; and in 
altitude through three zones, representing a vertical stratum of 8,000 feet. We have passed through 
a series of changes and contrasts in vegetation and climate of the most striking kind, and perfectly 
characteristic of Mexico. A. F. B. 

8. Esperanza. The region through which the road passes in the vicinity of Esperanza, is a cold, 
/ather barren looking highland, without any of the wildly picturesque scenery of the lower mount- 
ains; but the change is so sudden, that its very bleakness, with enormous prickly pears, dwarfish 
and ill-shapen palms, and tall maguey plants as types of vegetation, and the gigantic pyramid of 
Orizaba towering in full view to the east, has&apos; the effect of a successfully performed change in theat- 
rical scenery. A. F. B. 

9. San Marcos. A downward grade is struck beyond Esperanza, the highest point is passed at 
Guadalupe, and then the insensible and gradual decline to the central basin of Mexico begins. More 
and moro th^ iBolated peak of Malinche or Perote becomes prominent above the surrounding land- 
scape. It is 13,470 feet (English) above sea level. 

10. Huamantla. Beyond Huamantla the traveler is treated to a change in scenery again, and 
one of a very peculiar nature. Two remarkable sights burst into view almost simultaneously; the 
two great volcanic peaks of Mexico looming up like immense monuments. The most northerly,

with perpetual snow, and resting on a broad platform, which very gradually descends into dark forests. 
It has three summits; the northern, the highest, is 15,662 feet. While this mountain is lower than 
Popocatepetl, it is much more massive, its base being twice as long. From the west its long, icy crest 
appears, strikingly like a woman in her last repose, in a white shroud, lying on her back upon a steep- 
sided platform. The other, Popocatepetl, or moke Mountain, lies south of the former, and therefore 
at a greater distance from the railroad. It ppears as a perfect cone, slightly truncated, or rather 
with a cup-shaped summit. This concavity is the line of the crater here visible lengthwise, this 
part of the wall having fallen in, in the year 1664, whereas from Puebla it disappears, the top of the 
mountain rising above it to a sharp point. The height of Popocatepetl is 17,682 feet, being 314 feet 
higher than Orizaba. It thus appears to be the highest point of Mexico and of North America. The 
crater of Popocatepetl is a valuable mine of native sulphur. Its vast cup has a diameter of half an 
English mile, with such precipitous sides that it is considered impossible to descend into it, unless 
by means of a rope and crane. 

The skeleton or frame of the mountain is formed of dark porphyritic and basaltic rocks, while 
its ribs and protuberances are covered over and smoothed down by an enormous deposit of volcanic 
scoriae, to which is due the regular form of the peak. The rock of the other mountain is more com- 
pact, lighter colored, sometimes reddish, seldom amygdaloid, or spongy and very uniform. The 
limits of vegetation reach to about one-half the height of the mountain, a vast forest of pines of 
various species. Above this for two or three thousand feet the slopes are composed of dark gray or 
dirty red volcanic sand, with few crags and rocks protruding. Above this begins the ever-varying 
snow line, above which eternal snows cover the final slopes of the volcano, wherever they are not too 
steep to permit its lodging. Geologists state that Popocatepetl has had no eruption or emission of 
lava for centuries, but earthquake shocks occur every year in its vicinity, and the neighboring 
inhabitants are occasionally startled by dull sounds, like a plaintive moan uttered by a sleeping giant. 
History records the emission of smoke at various times. It is a tedious, but not in the least degree 
dangerous, journey to ascend it and stand on the brink of the crater, a yawning caldron in which the 
smoke of the three solfataras may be seen often mingled with the whirling clouds of a regular snow falF. 

The two summits of Popocatepetl and Yztac-cihuatl are connected by an apparently eroded 
ridge, which presents itself like a deep gap, notwithstanding its mean altitude of 10,000 feet, so that 
they shoot up in bold relief like perfectly isolated masses. Their bases are hid by lower mountains 
running northward, and the railroad rounds the outer spur of these ranges in order to descend into 
the valley of Mexico from the northeast. We, therefore, see the volcanoes in the course of six hours, 
in going from Vera Cruz to Mexico, successively from the east, northeast, north, and finally upon 
reaching the city of Mexico from the northwest. It was while Cortez and his Spaniards were yet in 
the higher timbered regions of Popocatepetl, they enjoyed that first glorious view of the valleV and 
the lakes which Prescott has so graphically described. A. F. B. 

11. Mexico. Few countries inspire so varied an interest as the valley of Mexico. It is the site 
of an ancient civilization of American people, and recollections the most affecting are associated with 
the city of Mexico and more ancient monuments, such as the Pyramids of Teotohuacan, dedicated 
to the sun and moon. Those who have studied the history of the conquest, delight to trace the 
military positions of Cortez and of the TIascaltee army. The naturalist contemplates with interest 
the immense elevation of the Mexican table-land, and the extraordinary form of a chain of porphy- 
ritic and basaltic mountains which surround the valley like a circular wall. He perceives that the 
whole valley is at the bottom of a dried up lake. The basins of fresh and salt water which fill the 
centre of the plain, and the five marshes, are to the eye of the geologist the small remains of a great 
mass of water which formerly covered the whole valley. HUMBOLDT. 

The valley of Mexico, however beautiful it may appear under certain aspects of light, is in fact 
the remnant, not of a deep mountain-lake, but of an enormous marsh, formed by the accumulation, 
without natural outlet, of the waters collected on the tops and running down the slopes of the high 
ranges surrounding it. In the very centre of the Lake of Tezcoco flat barges or scows sometimes are 
in danger of grounding. The descriptions furnished by eye witnesses 01 the conquest by Cortez, of 
the beauty and fertility of the Mexican valley, need not surprise us. The effect from a distance, on a 



clear day, in the limpid and transparent sky of these altitudes, 7.349 English feet above sea-level, is 
enchanting. To the little band of Spaniards, traveling along the lake shore by the sides of the culti- 
vated patches which the Indians had grouped around their puablos, near the placid water, the first 
which they had seen since leaving the coast, the sight must have been charming. And when, through 
the filling up of the marsh, parts of it became transformed into sober corn fields, we need not wonder 
at the regret expressed by some respecting the change. It was the feeling which we ourselves 
experience at seeing the picturesque supplanted by the useful. A. F. B.

12. Very interesting human remains were found in January, 1884, some two and a half miles east 
of the city of Mexico, imbedded in a rock composed of silicified calcareous tufa. They are described 
and illustrated in the American Naturalist, for August, 1885. 

12. Mexico. The valley of Mexico is eighteen and one-third leagues or fifty-five miles long, and 
twelve and a half leagues or thirty-seven miles in breadth. The crest of the mountains which sur- 
round it like a circular wall, is most elevated on the southeast, where the great volcanoes La Puebla, 
Popocatepetl, and Iztaccihuatl bound the valley. . The city is no longer built in the midst of a lake, 
connected with the continent merely by three dikes, owing to the diminution of water of the lake 
Tezcuco. Humboldt pronounced Mexico, undoubtedly one of the finest cities ever built by Europeans 
in either hemisphere, but much less from the grandeur and beauty of its structures, than from its 
uniform regularity, its extent and position, leaving a recollection of grandeur which he attributes to 
the majestic character of its situation and the surrounding scenery. The beautifully cultivated valley 
forms a singular contrast with the wild appearance of the naked mountains which enclose it, among 
which the three famous volcanoes above named, with their enormous cones covered with perpetual 
snow, are the most distinguished. 

14. Guadalupe. Dr. H. M. Chance, mining engineer, and lately an assistant on the second Geolog- 
ical Survey of Pennsylvania, who has been over this road, describes the plateau on which it is built 
as resembling to the traveler a fiat valley, for mountains are seen on both sides of the railroad. But 
the chains, upon close examination, are seen to be simply a series of ranges, broken at many points. 
The flat plateau seems to have been formed by Tertiary (?) deposits, filling in what were formerly deep 
valleys between these mountain ranges, thus forming a network of level connected valleys, the Ter- 
tiary deposits filling them up above the lower connecting ridges, leaving them in the condition of 
half buried mountains. This description by Dr. Chance is probably as true as it is picturesque. 

Between Zacatecas and the City of Mexico, Dr. Chance had less opportunity of examining the 
geology than at at Zacatecas, but he thought the mountains on this part of the route are Laurentian 
or Huronian, consisting of granites, porphyry, etc., and that the plateau or apparent valleys are Ter- 
tiary or Quaternary. The mountains nearer Mexico are partly volcanic, and at some points north also 
volcanic deposits are seen. These lava beds generally lie west of the railroad and form &quot;buttes&quot; or 
flat top mountains, the lava beds protecting the soft Tertiary deposits from erosion. (See Note 15.) 

15. Zacatecas. In the Zacatecas mining region an entirely different series of rocks from those to 
the northward is seen, apparently Huronian schists, with porphyry and Laurentian granites. This 
same series also occurs all along the range extending northwest, and lying, as at Chihuahua, twenty 
to one hundred miles west of the railroad. It probably also comes up in some of the ranges east of 
the railroad. H. M. C. 

16. Jimulco. The coal at Jimulco occurs in the plateau Tertiary deposits, and is apparently a 
lignitic bed of fluvio-marine origin. The bed opened in 1885 was too largely mixed with clay, etc. to 
be of any commercial value. See Note 1. Dr. Chance examined the mountains only at Jimulco, and 
found them to consist of an enormously thick series of limestone, partly metamorphosed, and prob- 
ably of Upper Carboniferous age.

18. Peronal and Conejo*. This whole country is one large network of encasea valleys, connected

19. Mendoza. From the topographical appearance of the mountains and the natural escarpments 
peen all along the rnail for three hundred miles from above Chihuahua, to within fifty miles of Zaca- 
tcoa~, Dr. Chance thinks the mountain rocks to be of similar character throughout this distance to 
those at Jimulco, namely, a very heavy formation of metamorphic Upper Carboniferous limestone.

and t&apos;rrt hytic, r.-d, blue, whit&quot; and gray. W. 

The Mountain* West of Chihuahua. Dr. Wislizenus was, during the Mexican war, detained six 
months a i.r. . in the Sierra Mad re Mountains, about ninety miles west of Chi- 

liuahu*. The p; . feet above the sea, and the highest peak of the chain of mountains, 

directly above thf ]&gt;la&apos;--, c:illfi the Bufa, a prominent landmark, is 7,918 feet. This is in tn- 
h^art of the Sierra Madre, and there were- some renowned silver mines there, all found in the por- 
I Myritio rocks, the prevailing formation in this part of the country. He reports the geology of the 
TV as quite uniform, and although he roamed in hunting for months in that vicinity over the 
- the whole western portion of the State of Chihuahua, the connecting 
n the Ror-ky Mountains of the north and the Andes of the south, he observed no other 
formations than porphyritic, except stratified limestone. These mountains contain old mines of sil- 
ver, gold, lead, iron and tin, which were celebrated in their day. 

21. Fresnillo. General Aspect of the Country. From a short distance south of El Paso nearly to 
Zaoate^as, some seven hundred miles, the plateau on which the railroad is built ia (in 188. r&gt;) little 
better than a desert. The grass is generally scattered and bunched, and there is very little gi- 
be seen at all, the principal vegetation being cactus and scrubby mesquite, and there is an almost

I See Note 4 in Texas chapter. 

entire absence of trees. But wherever the road approaches one of the principal water courses the 
scene changes. Irrigating ditches are seen on both sides of the stream, which is fringed as are the 
ditches by trees. These spots are as oases in a desert, arid the land is apparently very fertile. C. 

22. Rancheria. A porous, black-looking basaltic rock known as amygdaloidal basalt is very com- 
mon throughout the whole of Mexico. Below it, in New Mexico and at El Paso, is a compact quartoze 
furruginous sandstone, appearing as if changed by volcanic action. W. 

23. Samalayuca. After leaving El Paso, Texas, or Paso del Norte, Mexico, to the west is a 
mountain chain, and to the east the receding valley of the Bio del Norte, from which, in going south, 
a high chain of mountains soon separate you, the road passing over a wide sandy plain covered with 
mesquite and similar shrubbery, and then runs for many miles through sand hills or &quot;dunes,&quot; that 
are apparently of recent age. These sand hills similar to those in Texas, are an immense field of 
steep sandy ridges, without shrubs or vegetation of any kind, looking like a piece of Arabian desert 
transplanted into. this plain, or like the bottom of the sea uplifted from the deep. 

24. Paso del Norte and El Paso. See Notes 12, 13, 16, &apos;and 17 in Texas chapter. 

25. Dr. Persifor Frazer, who passed over this road says, the valley traversed by it is a calcareous 
formation, much crushed and altered, which is clearly newer than the Upper Carboniferous mountains 
between which it lies. It may be 19 c. Pliocene or that and Quaternary, but no fossils have yet been 
found, and it may be 19 b. Loup Fork Miocene. 

26. The Caudola Mountain is granite, also the Panuco, and a spur of the former reaching towards 
and near Bustamante. They protrude from the Upper Carboniferous. There is a large trap mesa 
about seven miles northeast of Caldera. P. F. 

27. The limestone mountains on this road are reported, by those 1 who have seen them both, to be 
similar to those on the Mexican Central (See Notes 16 and 19.) It forms steep, often rugged, moun- 
tains, rising on an average 2,000 feet above the plain. It is metalliferous, containing silver and lead 
mines, and has all the appearance of the limestone found at El Paso and Chihuahua, but as yet we 
have no report of the discovery here of any fossils. 

28. Aguasc.alientes. Here are famous hot springs, as indicated by the name. The place is a 
celebrated resort for invalids, and one of the cleanest provincial towns in Mexico. Population 
reported 20,000. H. M. C. 



There are several other railroads in Mexico, but as yet I have learned nothing in regard to their 
geology.- J.M. 



INDEX OF RAILROADS. 



N. B. Branches, or minor roads, will generally be found under the name of the 
main or controlling line. The latest names, owing to the constant changes, can not 
always be given, but in some instances roads, given in the body of the book under an 
old name, will be found indexed under the new, as well as the old. The Guide is in 
itself an Index, and thin Index is only an additional help to the traveler.
