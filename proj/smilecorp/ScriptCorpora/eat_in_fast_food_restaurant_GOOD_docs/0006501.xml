Ecommerce - dealing with complaints and aggressive online clients
 

Ever heard of anyone threatening to sue over a $2 purchase?
 Welcome to ecommerce!

There&apos;s something about the partial anonymity of online business
 that leads some clients to believe that
 rattling sabers is a great way to resolve conflict and the first strategy to
 engage.

I&apos;ve been involved with bricks and mortar business since the
 1980&apos;s and ecommerce since the mid-90&apos;s. I have noticed that customers have a
 greater tendency to come out swinging when online transactions don&apos;t quite go the way they
 expect. 

If you&apos;ve experienced your share of aggressive online
 clients or are just venturing into ecommerce, I hope this article can
 provide some valuable advice for dealing with these unpleasant incidents.
 Some of the following principles can also be applied to non-aggressive
 complaint resolution.

The&quot;customer is always right&quot;myth

Like many people, in my pre-Internet days of retail, I was
 taught by various employers that the customer was king and always right.
 Sure, customers are king to a certain degree, but times have changed. We
 live in a more aggressive,&quot;I want it now&quot;type society. Business
 is now more competitive and client loyalty can be very fickle. Competition
 has given consumers more power, as has the availability of consumer advocacy
 groups and hungry lawyers.

Consumer protection is a very positive thing, but it has led
 some misinformed people to believe that they can demand beyond what they are
 entitled to from a merchant.

Regardless of whether the client is in the right or in the
 wrong, their aggressiveness can cloud the real issues and challenge rapid
 resolution. This scenario can be a real time-sucker, distracting you
 from attending to core business - they need to be dealt with quickly and
 effectively.

Types of aggressive online clients

My experiences over the past few years in dealing with
 aggressive clients in a online environment has allowed me to categorize a person quite
 quickly. The&quot;I&apos;ll call my lawyer&quot;and&quot;I&apos;ll tell everyone on
 the Internet&quot;types can usually be broken
 down into 4 groups.

The clueless/illiterate client. 

These are people who shouldn&apos;t be using a computer to engage
 in online transactions without some further training. For these people, an
 Internet connection is a WMD - a Weapon of Mass Disruption.

These people have little to no online experience outside of
 browsing and believe that everything should be so intuitive that it
 requires no mental effort on their part at all. They are the ones most
 likely to order the wrong goods, record their delivery details incorrectly
 or repeatedly enter the wrong password into a client account interface :). Their
 email communications are usually poorly constructed and they expect the
 recipient to be a mind-reader.

Instead of acknowledging their own incompetence, they will
 invariably blame the technology. 

Here&apos;s a classic example. A client once contacted me stating
 that their access details didn&apos;t work. I couldn&apos;t find a record of them in
 our system. I inquired about this and they became a little impatient about it. I asked them to confirm the username and password - they sent me a blank
 email. I then asked them to send me a copy of a receipt. They sent me a
 photo of their house. After a week of back and forth trying to extract some
 sense from them, they sent me the receipt. It was from another company. They
 had signed up with *that* company, not ours and then proceeded to suck up
 several hours of my time in research and communications while we tried to
 resolve where the problem was. Of course, during this time they tried the&quot;I&apos;ll take further action!&quot;spiel.

The client with personal problems

Ever had one of those days where everything went wrong from
 the moment you opened your eyes? Online vendors make wonderful scapegoats
 for people who are experiencing personal problems. The anonymity of email or
 live chat can bring out the worst in those people. Instead of separating
 problems, they bundle them all together and fire the accumulated frustration
 at you.

The scammer client

These are the people that make a career of complaining and
 aggression. They do this in order to extract free services from ecommerce
 merchants - it&apos;s just schoolyard bullying brought into the adult world. They will kick up such a stink that you give them freebies or
 discounts just to get them off your back. Expect no loyalty from these
 people. Once they&apos;ve squeezed you all they can, they&apos;ll just move onto the
 next target.

The exasperated client

Out of all the categories, this is the only type whom
 deserves your utmost efforts to assist. These are the clients who have
 experienced legitimate problems and have been passed from pillar to post
 within your organization without any resolution. In their frustration, they
 become aggressive - still not acceptable, but more understandable.

Dealing with aggressive online clients 

The way you initially respond to an aggressive client is so
 important. It sets up the battlefield for a rapid victory or a long and
 bloody campaign. Equating customer support to war isn&apos;t a good mindset and I
 usually wouldn&apos;t draw that comparison, but once the client gets
 unnecessarily nasty,
 that&apos;s just what it is - a battle of minds.

Get it right and you can resolve it
 quickly. Get it wrong and it can drag on for weeks and cause you all sorts
 of legal problems if you&apos;ve identified the&quot;type&quot;of client
 correctly.

Probably the best way to illustrate a handling process is
 via a fictional example:

Example ---------------

&quot;Support,

I purchased a downloadable flomble with my credit card and
 the download link didn&apos;t arrive. Your site is (expletive) crap and a scam. I
 don&apos;t have (expletive) time to deal with this - my dog just got ran over and
 I don&apos;t need this (expletive). I expect you to refund my money and give me
 access to the flomble to make up for wasting my time otherwise I&apos;m going to
 call my lawyer and I&apos;ll sue your (expletive). Furthermore, I&apos;m going to post
 complaints about your (expletive) (expletive) company on every forum and
 blog on the Internet and tell people never to buy from you! Call me on my phone
 immediately as email confuses me and I&apos;ve emailed you 20 times already
 without response.

John&quot;

End Example -------------

You can laugh, but I&apos;ve seen this kind of email on occasion. In this type of complaint, it&apos;s difficult to categorize which
 type of aggressive client&quot;John&quot;is. He actually fits into quite a
 few categories; but we can&apos;t be sure at this point if he&apos;s also a scammer.

How to respond to aggressive complaints

John has threatened legal action, even though this is the
 first that you&apos;ve become aware of the problem. Bear in mind that in most
 instances, the client actually has no intention of calling up their lawyer.
 In most cases they won&apos;t have one; but you must tread cautiously. The threat
 about posting negative feedback around the web is probably the one to take
 more seriously as it&apos;s easy and free for them to do and can have a massive negative
 impact on your reputation - whether they are in the right or not.

So, going forward, remember
 that the goal is to not score points for personal satisfaction or to retaliate for spiteful comments,
 but to resolve the issues as soon as possible. Also bear in mind that
 however you respond, it may be reproduced and published somewhere.

There is one of two outcomes you&apos;ll want to achieve

 
resolve the issue with view to getting rid of the person
 altogether. 
resolve the issue with view to maintaining an ongoing
 relationship. 

Personally, I prefer the first goal. I really don&apos;t want
 clients who are abusive and aggressive as it may be a habit for them; but in
 John&apos;s case there is a hint that perhaps the issue *may* have been a
 failing on my company&apos;s part.

Let&apos;s give John a response. Even though John has demanded a
 phone call, if you do not offer phone support, then there&apos;s no reason why
 you should have to call him in the initial response. Also, an email response
 provides a written record in case things should get out of hand so you can&apos;t
 be accused of saying something you actually didn&apos;t say.

Example response -----------------------

John,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I wasn&apos;t aware you
 were experiencing problems until I received this email from you a few
 minutes ago. I have checked our support system and haven&apos;t been able to find
 any of the the previous emails you stated you sent.

I&apos;m responding to you via email as we don&apos;t offer phone
 support and this way, we both have a written record. 

John, I&apos;m sorry to hear about your dog; I understand this is
 a stressful time for you and I&apos;m eager to
 resolve this issue as quickly as possible. However, I do ask that you
 refrain from using abusive and vulgar language as it&apos;s unnecessary; I&apos;m here
 to help.

John, could you please provide me with some details of your
 purchase. Either please forward me a copy of the receipt, or if you didn&apos;t
 receive or no longer have a receipt, please provide me with the following details:

 
Your full name 
The date that you purchased the flomble 
The email address that you used when purchasing 
The last 4 digits of the credit card you used. 

Once I have that information, I will investigate with our
 team, check our billing systems and follow up with you within 24 hours. In
 the meantime, I&apos;d also like for you to check something for me - is it
 possible the email that would have contained the download link may have
 wound up in your bulk email folder or in the deleted items?

John, I can assure you we aren&apos;t a&quot;scam&quot;business
 and there&apos;s no need for you to go to the wasted expense of contacting your
 lawyer as it&apos;s really not necessary.
 We&apos;ve been involved with ecommerce now for nearly a decade and we&apos;re always
 more than happy to assist our clients when there is a problem.

While I also certainly recognize and respect the fact that
 you are able to post negative comments about our company around the Internet
 John, please do bear in mind that you&apos;ll also be accountable for anything
 you do choose to write about our company. Perhaps you may wish to give this
 situation a little more time before taking such an action because, as
 mentioned, we are indeed eager to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.

Sincerely,

Blah

End of example -----------------

There&apos;s a number of points achieved in this style of
 response:

 
Addressed the person by name in a number of instances,
 therefore giving the signal that they just aren&apos;t a&quot;number&quot; 
Shown that you responded quickly once you were aware of
 the problem 
Addressed each point made in the complaint 
Asserted that the issue will be resolved 
Gave a clear indication that vulgarities, aggression and
 threats will not be tolerated 
Liability for the problem has not been accepted as there
 isn&apos;t enough information provided to do so 
Asked for all the details needed to investigate fully
 without having to go back and forth with questions 
Defended the credibility of the business 
Haven&apos;t apportioned blame on the client. 
Made no offer of compensation at this point, just
 resolution. 

In the majority of cases, a response like this will help
 defuse the situation if the clients&apos; claim is legitimate. If they cannot
 provide the information, especially a credit card number or some sort of
 payment details, then it&apos;s likely
 they are a scammer. Never, ever accept liability from the outset if
 the circumstances aren&apos;t clear - this could work against you later.

Resolving the situation

It&apos;s important that once you have received the information
 that you follow up as promised. Failure to do so will only incense the
 client further and give them greater basis for a case and an excuse to
 become abusive again. How you resolve the situation depends on the scenario.

If your company is at fault

If the fault does turn out to be on your end, it doesn&apos;t
 mean you need to give the client exactly what they demand if they are asking
 for more than what they are legally entitled to. Give them some
 choices:

 
A full refund 
A partial refund, plus the product 
A credit on their next purchase 
Another companion product for free 

The idea is to give the client some power, but not all of
 it. This will give them a clear signal that you while you are meeting your
 obligations in the transaction, you aren&apos;t a doormat. Sincerely apologize for the
 inconvenience, but don&apos;t grovel - mistakes happen.

If fault cannot be determined

If it&apos;s not clear who was at fault, you may still wish to
 provide one of the above. If you do provide a discount or freebie, ensure
 you record it somewhere. This is for tracking purposes so that you can
 identify repeat&quot;offenders&quot;. A number of major fast food
 restaurant chains keep complaints books, not just as a QA (Quality
 Assurance) tool, but to identify freeloaders. 

If the client is at fault

If the client is at fault, then they should be gently
 advised as such. There&apos;s no use not addressing the fact as they will learn
 nothing and probably continue making the same errors. A gentle rap on the
 knuckles is sufficient:

&quot;John, the reason you didn&apos;t receive the download link
 was because you entered www.john@kdfjkfdjl.com instead of john@kdfjkfdjl.com
 in the order form&quot;

In these instances, it is suggested that you only provide
 the client with what they ordered; there is no need to provide the product
 for free - they received your attention for free when the problem laid
 squarely with them.

Continuing aggression

If the client continues to be aggressive in their responses,
 tell them in a professional way again that while you want to assist them,
 you will not tolerate abusive or vulgar language; and if they should
 persist, you will cease communications until such time that they can behave
 in a civil manner. Any direct physical threat made to you and your staff
 should be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency immediately.
 Ensure you keep a copy of all communications.

Remember, that regardless of the tone of the client and how
 much it may hurt you - do not match their aggression, just be assertive.

If they *should* call their lawyer and their lawyer contact
 you, you can then show your attempts to resolve the situation and also point
 out how aggressive and abusive their client was. That should earn them a
 slap on their wrist from their lawyer and minimize the possibility of
 further legal action.

Your staff and aggressive clients

It&apos;s important that your staff be trained in dealing with
 aggressive clients. In fact, wherever possible, aggressive communications
 from clients should be immediately escalated to you or to a senior manager.
 This shows the client that someone in the upper ranks of the organization
 has taken special&quot;interest&quot;in them. This&quot;interest&quot;works in your favor in two ways:

 
It shows the client that you feel their complaint is
 important. 
It shows the client you don&apos;t allow your staff to be
 bullied or abused. 

Prevention as a strategy

The old saying of&quot;an ounce of prevention is better
 than a pound of cure&quot;is very relevant in online business. Ensure that
 your ordering/delivery systems, faq&apos;s and help documentation are spot on and
 you&apos;ll have less of these sorts of issues to deal with.

Set up your site to
 require as little mental effort on the clients&apos; part as possible. It&apos;s a sad
 fact that most of us don&apos;t like to think too much these days. Live
 chat/support software and effective shopping
 cart software can also be of great benefit in heading off complaints.

Aggressive clients in ecommerce are not a passing fad. In
 fact as time goes on and our world generally becomes more aggressive, you&apos;ll
 see more of them. It&apos;s important for all of us as ecommerce merchants to
 send a clear signal to our clients - we want to deliver the best possible
 service to them, but that abusive and aggressive behavior will not be
 tolerated.

By the way, it doesn&apos;t hurt to have an online-savvy lawyer
 of your own on stand-by for dealing with continually unreasonable clients
 who just don&apos;t&quot;get the message&quot;. A brief&quot;cease and
 desist&quot;letter from a lawyer to them can save you many hours and much
 stress. Plus there is a degree of satisfaction without having to sink to the
 level of the person :).
