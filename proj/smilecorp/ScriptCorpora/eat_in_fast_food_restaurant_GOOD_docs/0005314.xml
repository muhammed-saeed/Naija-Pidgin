 Even as climate change turns up the heat, we go on fracking 
 July 10, 2012 | By David Horsey In the midst of a broiling summer that is burning up crops and killing people, a lot of Americans, including most of the leaders of one of our two major political parties, do not think climate change is a problem. Like ostriches with their heads stuck in the tar sands, they want to go on fracking like there&apos;s no tomorrow. The dubious good news is that there is far more oil and natural gas in North America than anyone knew until very recently. If fully utilized, it could end America&apos;s dependence on oil from the Middle East. CALIFORNIA | LOCAL

 Hey, cabbie: You&apos;re welcome 
 July 22, 2007 Your article on Las Vegas tipping [&quot;Right at the Tipping Point,&quot; July 1] is pretty much right on the money, but taxi drivers are getting greedy. When you give drivers a 10% to 20% tip in San Francisco or New York, they say thank you. But when you similarly tip a Vegas cabbie these days, you often get a dirty look and/or a rude remark.

 The Dream may be over soon for the NBA-Olympic partnership 
 July 9, 2012 | By Mike Bresnahan LAS VEGAS - It was a peculiar time for David Stern to open such a dialogue, but the time and place signified his seriousness. This might be it for the Dream Team concept in the Olympics. The NBA Finals were 45 minutes from tip-off last month when the league commissioner said it himself - cognizant that NBA owners fretted every four years about players being injured with the extra month of activity . . . that the players themselves began to question whether they should be paid to play for Team USA . . . and, finally, that the NBA wasn&apos;t making an abundance of money by lending its assets to the national cause of thumping (take your pick) TRAVEL

 Five cities, five costs 
 July 8, 2012 It was $82 for a cab from Haneda Airport in Tokyo into town and more than triple that from Narita. The good news: It&apos;s not that expensive to eat in Japan. Or really any of the four other places we tried. The Associated Press sent reporters on a typical tourist&apos;s itinerary one weekday in June in New York, Paris, Tokyo, Dubai and Buenos Aires to compare prices. There were some pleasant surprises. One was just how affordable it is to be a tourist in Dubai, which is perceived as one of the world&apos;s most expensive cities. TRAVEL

However, the Viking Serenade on Royal Caribbean Line suggested appropriate tipping by leaving envelopes under cabin doors for service by stewards, waiters, the maitre d&apos; and busboys. And why not? Their service, especially in the dining room, was impeccable, making a four-night cruise a real holiday, with persons of 46 nationalities on board to serve us. JULIA M.
