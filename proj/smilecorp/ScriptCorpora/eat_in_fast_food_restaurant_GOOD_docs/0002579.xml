CoCo Joe’s is now open

I like this blog, kinda wish it was updated more!
I’m wondering if you have any updates on a place called Oriental Dragon Sushi Bar….I saw it while I was driving down Perryville…it’s in that shopping center with Hollywood Video and Jimmy John’s near Woodman’s. Any word?

Ryan—Thanks for your feedback! I’m glad you like the blog, and I’ll try to post more often for you. I actually have a call into First Rockford Group about Oriental Dragon, so check back. Hope to have something more on that soon.

CoCo Joe\’s has really good food–you won\’t be disappointed if you go there! So glad something moved into the old Dairy Queen spot, because that was such a nice location for that neighborhood.

I finally decided to stop and try this place out. WOW! what a disapointment.
I ordered a large choc. dipped cone. The girl that served it looked like she just got done shopping at fredrick of hollywood and bought out the entire walmart jewlery counter. She hands me this 3inch cone with 10inches of icecream on top with this water down chocolate dip on it, icecream dripping and spewing from all the cracks. I ssaid this doesnt look good, where’s the chocolate? and with a deer in the head lights look says…I dont know and runs off with a pissed off look. comes back with something that sorta looks a little better. unfortunatly I take this mess and pay for it. No have a nice day No Im sorry an no receipt. unfortunatley the chocolate dip wasnt that good and i know have icecream dripping all over me while driving. A real Icecream cone Disater.

Hopefully this isnt they way these guys run their buisness all the time but im kinda guessing it is. well I think ill stick to DQ and skip this place next time.

Im betting this place wont last long.

My boyfriend&amp;I ate at this place last Saturday. Both ordered the everyday special–dbl hamburger w/fries&amp;drink for $3.99 and we both asked for cheese to be added. So we get this to go, are driving down the road start eating our food&amp;no cheese on the burgers. Okay easy enough mistake…except we got charged for it (wasn’t given a receipt either). Food didn’t taste bad but by later that night we didn’t feel that good. The boyfriend felt the worst, I was okay. Finally figured out he must have gotten food poisoning from this place.

I advise not to go here..I certainly won’t be going back! Yuck!
