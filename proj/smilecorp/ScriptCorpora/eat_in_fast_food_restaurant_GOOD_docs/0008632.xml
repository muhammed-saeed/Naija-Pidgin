 Tumblr user lolwhut The offending receipts 
​ 
 UPDATE : Chick-Fil-A has just issued a statement that confirms the above incident happen, which should shut up the skinheads and conservative who believe racism doesn&apos;t exist anymore.
 
 As reported by the always-great Angry Asian Man , which first broke the story:

 Please understand and accept our confirmation that the inappropriate, and unthinking behavior of a young team member at one of our restaurants does not support any claim or even suggestion of racism at our restaurant. The individual clearly violated our operating standards; the matter was addressed and discussed immediately with the guests on the spot; and a confirmation was provided that the employee was immediately dismissed for the individual behavior.

Our Chick-fil-A restaurant Operators and their employees try very hard every day to actually go the extra mile in serving ALL of our customers with honor, dignity and respect. The circumstances here are a simply case of immaturity, failed judgment, and human error....it has nothing to do with the service and operational standards of our Chick-fil-A restaurants which are consistently rated at the highest level of service in the foodservice industry. &quot;

Will this placate Asian-Americans and all good people who are already sick of the Southern chain&apos;s gay-nasty ways? Stay tuned...
 
ORIGINAL POST, Dec. 10, 1:27 p.m. : The fast-food chicken-sandwich
 giant Chick Fil-A already has a horrible reputation among LGTB folks 
for the company&apos;s gay-averse ways and atheists for their Godboy 
mentality, but now there&apos;s a new group they just might permanently 
offend: Asians.

 As first reported by Angry Asian Man, UC Irvine student Kelvin Lee posted on his Tumblr page the above receipt , which he said was given to him by a fellow UCI student, an RA who took his residents to a local Chick Fil-A this (which one isn&apos;t disclosed, a fact we&apos;re trying to find out). 1 | 2 | Next Page &gt;&gt;

To live in a society where it&apos;s not ok to mock or put down anyone&apos;s ethnicity, language, culture, etc.
 
What the heck? Uh... that&apos;s totally not true. I&apos;m Asian American, and I&apos;m proud of it. Also, I honestly can&apos;t believe you just generalized all Asians into your preconception of a &apos;Classic Ching-Chong&quot;. Truly, that&apos;s absurd. Have you ever read the book&quot;Battle Hymn of a Tiger Mother&quot;? Look at their family, then look how their daughters got into Harvard on a full scholarship. Lots of Asians live in the US with a US Residence, we don&apos;t eat dogs and cats (the Hindus probably are shocked at us eating beef, you know. not everyone view animals the same way.) I can&apos;t even understand why I&apos;m explaining this to you! Please, change your mindset of an Asian. It&apos;s so cruel and unfair how you think of us.
 
Ching and Chong are upset but they are the biggest invited bigots in the USA. These dog-eating, cat-eating with bad body odor get here and they get our Uncle Sam taxpayer money, get wealthy and look down on us. LOL, you look at my culture as bad but you eat dogs and cats, asian men love to sex down their daughters, they have bad BO, they have ugly teeth, can&apos;t play hockey, can&apos;t play football, two inch penises, and y&apos;all are the only failures in all of races to be nuked. Fucque an Asian, I hate asians and I wish they would leave the USA.
 
I am Asian, and I find it funny. Haha, look at that! It&apos;s in gigantic capital letters across the top even. CHING CHONG.It may be stupid and/or racist, but it&apos;s still funny.
 
Who gives a damn? It was probably some high school kid thinking it was a funny joke. Come on now, you want to harp on the only corporation in America that still publicly displays it&apos;s connection with God and christianity? Well, now I suppose these idiots will tell us Chick fil-A must be open every Sunday. Move on.
 
Don&apos;t think you&apos;d think it would be f***** funny if your nationality was being trashed..... Remember..... what goes around ALWAYS come back around.....!
 
You been sippin&apos; STERNO again?!??? FOOL!!
 
Racists are simply ignorant and insecure -- no matter what their ethnicity.
 
But was it&quot;there pleasure&quot;, though, THAT&apos;S the question.  Many people 
don&apos;t realize that Chik-FIL-A trains/expects their mgt&amp;associates 
to say&quot;my pleasure&quot;instead of&quot;you&apos;re welcome&quot;as a response to&quot;thank
 you&quot;.  The underlying reason for this is that they&apos;re providing a 
SERVICE (with pleasure, ostensibly) and are by no means a CHARITY.  Then
 of course, they rake in BIG BUCKS on the True Sabbath (which is 
actually Saturday), and of course are closed on Sunday to indicate 
(ostensibly, again) their compliance with&quot;mainstream church-ianity&quot;.  A
 company of dildoes, to be sure.  Great job Chink-Fil-A, and by all 
means, Thank You...

Seems like the person to blame is server&quot;Lia&quot;.
 
You mean they have a notorious Christian FundaMENTAList reputation -- i.e, they are closed nationwide on Sundays, even in shopping malls.

Religion = Superstitious Nonsense for Ignorant Imbeciles.

Period.

... but they do make a damn good chicken sandwich.
 
If god wanted man to eat chicken, he would have created Chick-Fil-A !
 
These comments seem proof enough that racism is still alive and well...
 
Exactly!
 
Concocted scam possibility.

Aware of the immense amount of white self-guilt and the mass media attention easily accrued how difficult would it be for a couple minority-types to have GIVEN those names to the order taker then grabbing the receipts as proof of&quot;racism&quot;and commence the lawsuit?

Or do you assume folks do not lie or use media for self-gain or any of a multitude of possibilities?
 
And here come the skins...
 
Find a Mandarin or other Chinese dialect speaker and take them along to the closest&quot;China town&quot;area of decent size.

Works best if they speak English with no Chinese accent and act as if they do NOT speak Chinese.

While sitting there; have them quietly translate some of the comments made about the presence of the foreigner (you).

Yeah....&quot;racism&quot;is limited to the self-loathing guilt-ridden Whites of the USA.

Do the same with a fluent Spanish speaker.

The USA has filled its folks, especially you fair-skinned scum with so much self-guilt that non-whites are taking advantage of you and laugh either in front of you or behind your backs.
 
&quot;racism doesn&apos;t exist anymore&quot;Simple ill-educated minds can find confirmation of their beliefs nearly anywhere.

Don&apos;t omit the oft-sen separate areas upon grocery store shelves for white and wheat breads, etc.

Obvious proof of white separatism.

And if there are more offerings for the white beads, well, ample proof of white superiority.

Sheesh... political correctness must assuredly result in the eventual collapse/downfall of the USA.

Now, run off and bleat ye ill-educated knee-jerk rhetoric spewing ill-educated well-indoctrinated citizen-sheep.
 
IM SURE  SHELL GET  BETTER JOBS...SHE WAS AN 18 YEAR OLD FIRST JOB OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL......THE YOUNGINS LIVE N LEARN.....
 
THIS IS ALL JUST  ANOTHER FUNNY STORY IN THE NEWS.....GIVE IT A FEW MORE DAYS AND IT WILL GO AWAY......I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THESE TWO BOYS CRY AND COMPLAIN ABOUT EVERYTHING...WHERES OUR SENSE OF HUMOR????  I&apos;M SURE THE CASHIER WASN&apos;T TRYING TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF THAT PLACE.....I&apos;M IN AWW  WITH A LOT OF THE NEWS TODAY...ITS A WASTE OF TIME....
 
The cashier should have gone with Harold and Kumar instead. It would be funnier and she still would have kept her $5/hr job.
 
the location was the chick-fil-a at The District on Jamboree and Barranca... it is the only nearby chick-fil-a to UCI.
 
Yeah, Mitch is proud of the hand car wash he runs out of his home garage...
 
The proprietor (who is of foreign decent) is one of the kindest and sweetest businessmen I have ever run across.  He was and is deeply disturbed by the events and he is incredibly welcoming to any type of person that steps foot inside his establishment.  The fact that one horrible and insensitive human being caused so much harm to so many with their moment (hopefully it was just a moment and not a lifetime) of cruelty should not bring down such a beacon to the community.  I will continue to support this Chick-fil-A due to their history of outstanding service and I applaud the victims here (and their friends) for being brave enough to stand up for what was right while understanding and expressing this is not an epidemic at this location.
 
And Dave STILL pwned you haha
 
Sudaca se refiere al patrón tuyo.
 
I being of Polish ancestry,I have at my age heard every joke or nick name there is,it&apos;s not even funny anymore
 
HAHAHAHAHH!  You made me laugh out loud at my desk.  

I saw this on CBS news.  Trust but verify.  I know there are racist or at least people who do stupid things that appear to be racist.  And I also know there are people who whip out the racist card when the wind blows the wrong way.  

You live and learn huh?
 
Huh? We&apos;ve been commies since day one...
 
Wassamatter Gus, the spotlight moving away from YOU?
What is all this touchy-feely, PC socialist garbage anyway?
Oh, I thought I was at the OC Register site, not OC weekly!
My bad!
 
As far as that goes, most of the penis pumps are made in China these days, so needledickism should not be so much a problem...
 
So someone lost their job because a pair of customers have no sense of humor? What about Rosie ODonnel, who made fun of asian speech with her&quot;chin-chong-chang&quot;speach mocking of them. Did Rosie get canned? No, she actually has a new TV program.
Maybe it&apos;s a liberal thing, rather than a race thing.
 
Keep eating those fries and you&apos;ll find out sooner rather than later.
 
Anyone who is going to really defend the cashier&apos;s actions are real idiots.  Am I offending you? Good.  The fact is, if you hold any professional position, whether min. wage or high paying, you have to be Professional.  You can not make derogatory statements about other ethnic backgrounds without repercussions.  No matter what anyone can say about this situation, it is wrong.  Yes, Ching Chong is sensitive to Asians because it has always been use as a derogatory word against Asians.  Growing up in a non-Asian community, it has been used commonly and other words as well. I grew up in bad area and there were only 5 white people in my school.  We often get into fights and other stuff ever since elementary school.  This is common for minorities in almost all communities who have been oppressed, whether you are White, Asian, Black, Hispanic, etc.  That is how many gangs formed.  You can not put an example of someone putting Smith or John Doe on a receipt because those are not used as a derogatory words against anyone.  They are just common names.  It is obvious why the cashier chose Ching and Chong duh!  If you do not know someone&apos;s name, well don&apos;t put anything.  If the receipt had n*gger, cracker, white trash, b*eaner, etc. I would feel the same way for anyone who receives that receipts not just for Asians.  Come on, you might do you racist jokes with your friends and there are many comedians that do it.  Heck, I can laugh at those jokes, shoot even on KROQ, but to straight up put some racist comment on a receipt, is a no go for anyone, it is just plain racist and ignorant.
 
Geez, what do you need? A cashier saying&quot;We ruve you rong time&quot;while drawing a Fu Manchu mustache on the receipt. I&apos;m sorry to break this to you yet again, but racism does exist here in Orange County!
 
Sorry if im a still a doubter I&apos;m thinking Chik Fil A just wanted to make it all go away.
 
Dude Cleveland is one of the most racist places I have ever been  and I have been to Tennessee and Alabama.  

Beachwood is known as little Gaza or the Gaza Strip 
Pepper Pike is Jew Pike 
Chagrin Park is where Chagrin Falls keeps all their Black folks
East Cleveland is called the Jungle

The Flats
55th and Kinsman 
Tremont
 
I can go on and on and on.
 
Chikfila cracks me up,&quot;We&apos;re not racist -- we fired that bitch!  By the way, we think that all our non-Xian customers are going hell.  Would you like some fries for your journey?&quot;
 
Easy: they have a notorious anti-LGBT reputation. Shall we elucidate?
 
Dont get suspicion twisted with defending...  I&apos;m not saying it was right but if memory serves me it was a case of selective outrage.
 
&quot;chain&apos;s gay-nasty ways?&quot;WTF kind of language is this?
 
There&apos;s the story!
 
Actually, Chick-fil-A did the right thing. Some idiot kid did something stupid by typing that into the register and was fired immediately. Chick-fil-A apologized and acted responsibly. So, where&apos;s the story? People like to over exaggerate an issue where none exists.
 
Uh...hmm...if the employee doesn&apos;t understand that such statements are offensive and oppressive to asians, then that person has a problem with asians. It&apos;s called ignorance and insensitivity. Those are problems. Know what I&apos;m saying? The whole,&quot;Oh, I didn&apos;t mean&quot;Chink&quot;like that&quot;argument is a non-starter.
 
If what this person did annoys you, YouTube Rosie Odonnell Ching Chong and watch her Ching Chong tirade, then boycott Her.
 
Yes, all seven of you that are left can feel smug. Last one out onto eastbound 90 turn off the lights, OK?
 
Come on Mitch, you can do it. Elbows up, side to side...
 
its kinda lame that we are lashing out and labeling the restaurant horrible and racist when it was one person. By people saying that Chickfila is racist they are doing the very thing that they are accusing the restaurant of. I am pretty sure this has happened at other restaurants but people dont lash out the same way. Yes it was wrong but saying the restaurant is horrible for one person is not right either.
 
&quot;Cincinnati by the Sea&quot;...I&apos;m stealing that!
 
Ah..Orange County...same old intolerant biblethumper-ruled hellhole.  Orange County is a place us flyover-country-folk here in Cleveland can feel smug and superior about...we don&apos;t have the racists and fundies and anti-Semites that OC has.  Our county council (Cuyahoga County) has 3 GOPers out of 11 members..the OC Board of Superviors is STILL 100% Republican...in December 2011.  Jesus.  Orange County.....Cincinnati by the sea.
 
By your (as usual) pendejo logic, then you now love cholos!
 
Best way for any restaurant to deal with is to reprogram the register so the cashier can’t add input.

Every receipt has a number … just call the last two digits Like “Number 63 your order is ready”
Don’t even ask for the customers first name, because it might just pronounced it wrong and it turns out to be a cuss work in some 3rd world language.

If I went to some Asian restaurant and they put “Smith” or “Jones” or “Johnson” on my receipt, I would be laughing so hard I would keep coming back for some more play.
 
Anyone got the race of the perp yet. I&apos;m still betting it was a &apos;hispanic&apos;/latina.
 
Oh shit, Klavito hates Rand (and presumably Randians). I&apos;m going to have to rethink my position on that cult.
 
She probably doesn&apos;t speak English, or Chinese.
 
Hey people lets look at this for what it is, Chick fil A did not do this , an employee did and she was immediately fired for her actions, why are you all talking about the company when they did the right thing, they apoligized to the customer on behalf of there employees misconduct. People have to take responsibility for there own actions the restaurant was not at fault here the employee was she is the racist or actually the stupid ass that was trying to be funny, and it backfired on her . So stop arguing about something that has nothing to do with the story and grow up. Who cares if chick fil a believes that there employees should be with there families on sundays or if they are christian based company , if that bothers you then don&apos;t eat there ,that is what is wrong with the people in this country if it offends one person then it should not be well too bad . That is why we live in the United States of America you have a choice if you don&apos;t like something you can choose to not do it or not go there but stop acting like you dont.
 
If that happened it&apos;s not racism just stupidity....I&apos;m going to guess the employee thought it was funny(it wasnt) and probably has no problem with asians. If people weren&apos;t offended so easy they would just use this as an excuse to get free food for a while at the expense of a not so brite employee.
 
I don&apos;t! And I don&apos;t play the&quot;apparent&quot;game--there are many scoffers here who just got pwned--just like you haha!
 
So, the author whines about people who stereotype and discriminate (racists), by, hmm, stereotyping and discriminating (lumping the skinheads and, apparently, single conservative)?  How does the author expect us to take him seriously?
 
A.S. is stupid.
 
See, this freaking name policy gets them into trouble constantly. They always mispronounce my name as a woman&apos;s name when I go there.

On the other hand, you can have a bit of fun with it, since they will call your name a few times: Tell them your name is Bueller.&quot;Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?&quot;
 
What is the point, exactly???
To create a hypersensitive society that coddles the individual into a stupor?

What qualifies any of you to be thought police?
 
hmmmm... what if it was different... what if they were two white guys and a cashier picked Smith and Johnson...no one would care.  By the way, I live in Irvine and believe me...Ching and Chong is probably a very common last name in that&quot;diverse&quot;city
 
Oh, please...
 
That one smelled too... If you remember the guy had a joking relationship with the bartenders and then one day out of the blue he was offended.
 
&quot;[That&apos;s] really screwed up. Bye, Lia!&quot;
 
Now, you&apos;ve gone too far!  Seriously, the message in A.S. is a good one.  Take off your red beret; it&apos;s out of fashion.
 
Obviously you don&apos;t know sarcasm  (im korean)
 
This doesn&apos;t hold a candle to the joint that put&quot;McStinkyn*gger&quot;and&quot;McN*gshit&quot;on a black dude&apos;s credit card receipt. Lia needs to step up her game.


Also...I don&apos;t believe this ever really happened. Seems troll-ish. Waiting for verification.
 
Shhhhhh. Dont tell anyone!
 
It&apos;s offensive and troubling. While Orange County is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the U.S., in my opinion, it is becoming an increasingly geographically and culturally segregated population, especially among younger people.
 
909Jeff is Timmy Keller in disguise!!
 
lol, Ching&amp;Chong, thats jsut too cool dude.

www.Total-Privacy [dot] US
 
I knew there was a reason I do not like the place. I did not know they were a&quot;christian&quot;business, I just knew from the one time I tasted food from there it was bland tasteless garbage! 
Now I know why! LOL
 
I believe you all have been hoaxed, once again.
Not only did this not happen to the guy that originally posted the receipts, it was from his friends students.
I bet some kids did it as a joke, told her their names were Ching and Chong and now trying to turn it in to a racist thing, or just pulling yet another hoax over everyone.
 
ok Dave, my translation software does not recognize those characters, what were you saying?
 
LOL I had a friend get insulted when I referred to her race as either hispanic or latino, (I forget which) she angrily retorted&quot;I am Mexican, from Mexican Indians&quot;(referring to Chiapas I believe)&quot;I am not Puerto Rican or Spanish or Guatamalan&quot;. 

But I do understand the resentment, many of my friends, (white or asian) refuse to use the term Mexican, using the term&quot;Spanish&quot;trying to be polite instead of what they really mean as wetback. It is difficult to be politically correct when the correct terms seem to change frequently.
 
I&apos;m offended that your handle is John Galt, the product of the figment of a lunatic woman&apos;s imagination...
 
Seriously? There are people that find this to be&quot;offensive&quot;?  My god, how do you people get through life?  Know what?  I&apos;m offended that you&apos;re offended.  Deal with THAT.
 
Dos Chinos at Filet De Pollo! LOL.
 
my problem with this is that I know the students who put that on the receipt would be crying to the NAACP if someone wrote the n word on their receipt.  if you&apos;re gonna dish it, take it as well!
 
She shouldn&apos;t have any trouble getting her job back at McDs. Afterall, her cousin is the manager.
 
&quot;This is just another incident in a growing list of PR issues from a company that hides behind Christian values&apos; as an excuse to promote hatred, intolerance,&quot;Christians have had their beliefs for 2000 years... Their not hiding and its not an excuse.  

Why is it you cant be tolerant of what they believe?  Why is it that the Christians are being bigots?  Arent you being bigoted against them? 

I&apos;m not advocating for the Christians... In as much as I&apos;m pointing out that generally its a case of the pot calling the kettle black.
 
Why would I care if they are closed on sunday?  Some areas in NJ force all businesses of certain types to be closed on sunday (google blue light laws).

Its more of this Angie individual seems to think that just because they are a &apos;christian company&apos; they are somehow different then every other company on the planet.
 
No, it&apos;s really not a double standard. A double standard means there&apos;s one set of rules for one group and a different set of rules for another. The rules are the same here for everyone: don&apos;t use unprofessional, racist or otherwise inappropriate epithets at work, whether it&apos;s directed at Asians or Caucasians.&lt;I&gt;Y, a propósito, escuincle, sabes bien que soy neojerseíta, entonces no comprendo por qué me estás tratando (¡y tan groseramente!) de suramericano. Deja de escribir tus pendejadas con esos ojos de becerro ahorcado y cállate, que los adultos hablen de cosas seriosas.&lt;I&gt;
 
blah blah blah... And its a travesty that they are closed on sunday too right?
 
United States of America... The only country in the world where the poor people are obese and own 2 TV&apos;s!
 
So just because a company is a &apos;christian based company&apos;, they can do no
 wrong and are the perfect shining examples of how a company should be?

This is just another incident in a growing list of PR issues from a company that hides behind &apos;christian values&apos; as an excuse to promote hatred, intolerance, etc.
 
I used to tell short-order cooks my name was Harry Pitz.
 
More likely the one in Tustin (@ the District) than Irvine.  The location in Irvine is too far from UCI.  Tustin is much closer.  But there may also be one in Newport Beach or Costa Mesa.  So several possibilities.
 
an example of a&quot;first world problem&quot;
 
This thread is full of WIN, but in order for it to become EPIC, we need to hear Lia&apos;s side of the story.  Where are you Lia?!
 
Hey when I told the people at Baja fresh my name was Nest there were tickets too.
 
I said it was a claim, Jeff, a guy who wrote about the incident, and there are ticket stubs--that&apos;s a story.
 
Okay...

Ive had enough of you... You have posted about how appalled you are, and how people don&apos;t understand whats its like to be discriminated against.  Yet it took you four posts to take off on Christians... Yeah real diverse and tolerant of you.  Which by the way this whole story is based on Heresay.  I have never been to a Chik Fil A where I WASN&apos;Tasked my name.  You&apos;re ruthlessly chastising a cashier who works for minimum wage at a slop shop on the word of a couple college student,  because we all know that college students have never pulled a prank before... HELL I used to do it when I was in college, I&apos;d tell the cashier my name was Nest so when my food came up they would be up there shouting what sounded like Next! (Hey college students do stupid shit) 

Chick Fil A is a conservative southern Christian organization I&apos;m surprised it took this long for something to come up... I would hold of on Judgement until the FULL story is available.

And where do you live that you get stared at for being married to a Latino?  I&apos;m thinking your own insecurities are what you may have a problem with.  No one stares at me and my Latina Wife... Or when I&apos;m hanging out with my half black brothers.  And if they are I wouldn&apos;t notice because I don&apos;t live my life worried about what complete strangers think about me. 

I dont blame Gustavo for publishing this story just to say I&apos;m a bit put off that he rushed to put it out with an obvious bias without knowing the full details. C&apos;mon Gustavo you&apos;re the boss now... Lead by example!

And lastly, Danielle I do know what it feels like to be discriminated against and interestingly enough it was by the Chinese when I was in Hong Kong.  You see, segregation is still legal there and I tried to go into a Chinese only restaurant and an old Chinese man tried to physically remove me...  But I don&apos;t get my panties in a bunch about it.
 
Still a double standard, even if you don&apos;t like people pointing it out, sudaca.
 
Yeah, so tough. I guess that&apos;s why non-white people are streaming, by the millions, into the societies created by white people.
 
Obviously someone doesn&apos;t know the meaning of &apos;anecdote&apos; or &apos;likelihood&apos;.
 
Stop your ethnic whining, gabacho: you sound like a Chicano Studies grad from the 1980s.
