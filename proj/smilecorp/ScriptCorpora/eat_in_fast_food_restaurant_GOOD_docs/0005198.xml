 Roswell opens its alien arms to boy battling brain cancer 
 Submitted by KOB.com Staff Tuesday, September 21st, 2010, 7:21pm 
A Michigan boy battling brain cancer got his wish Tuesday in Roswell.

Johnny Dobb, 9, met an alien and recieved an autograph. City officials invited Johnny and his family to Roswell to celebrate his birthday after hearing about Johnny’s battle with cancer and his belief that if he met an alien he would be cured.

Dozens of companies donated gifts and supplies to the Dobb family for their visit. Johnny’s family says they got more than they ever expected.

“This is absolutely amazing,”said Jennifer Dobb, Johnny’s mom.“We never dreamed that this would happen. We thought we would drive into Roswell and see some alien diners and go home. We were definitely not expecting anything of this magnitude.”

Johnny underwent radiation treatment in Phoenix and his family was able to stop in Roswell while on their way home to Michigan.
