 English-English Dictionary 
Here&apos;s a short dictionary of some of the more common differences in
word usage between British English and American English, especially
words that may be misunderstood. Other vocabulary differences will
make you appear quaint, but the person to whom you are speaking will
probably understand you.

 Other English Differences 
You may also encounter British English words which have a
significantly different definition in American English. For example, 
in American English the
noun &quot;slip&quot; is used to refer to women&apos;s undergarments, not men&apos;s underwear.
Try to avoid using any form of slang, since it is likely to be
misunderstood or even be found offensive. Also avoid using the words
&quot;ass&quot;, &quot;buns&quot;, &quot;fag&quot;, &quot;fanny&quot;, and &quot;queer&quot;, which have pejorative
meanings in American English.
The word &quot;Asian&quot; means a person of 
Chinese,
Japanese,
Korean,
Philippino, or 
Vietnamese origin in American English. (In British English it refers
to people from Bangladesh, India, or Pakistan.) Likewise, the word
&quot;Indian&quot; refers to an indigenous American in American English, not
necessarily someone from India. The word &quot;Indian&quot; is somewhat ambiguous in
American English, so the word &quot;Native American&quot; is preferred.
