 &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; Make sure you get the original 2007 British version.
So many funny moments, I love swearing in a British accent. Oh and Uncle Alfie on the crapper...&quot;it&apos;s touch and go&quot; and &quot;you missed a bit&quot; - Classic &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; This is so funny, Jane Fonda&apos;s Mum and all the stairs is hilarious and when she gets drunk....ya gotta watch it! &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; Make sure to watch BOTH versions, the theatrical and the director&apos;s cut...let me know which one YOU liked best! &quot;Mr. Holland&apos;s Opus&quot; I love Richard Dreyfuss, since Jaws and this movie is so uplifting and beautiful. &quot;Serendipity&quot; I think this is one of my favorite movies of all time...well at least the one with NO vampires in it...ha!

 Touch of Kindness 
 
 

or something. I had Jeff run to the fast food restaurant and bring home hamburgers and fries, and I have been&quot;running&quot;to the can all night...such fun eh? What a nice way to start my post...sorry about that. So when I say I gotta run...I mean it. Ha!

So today was the last of my 10/10/20 Birthday card class and I have a few of the cards that I want to make up, and I promise I will put them up on my blog to sell ok? I am gonna actually have fun tomorrow (unless I still am having my&quot;issues&quot;) and going to lunch and some shopping with my sweet friend Melissa. (hey huuny bunny!)

I wanted to use my new set from the new mini catalog coming out May 1, cause well, it is a coloring one and that makes me happy, plus I had some cardstock left over from this card , and I wanted to use it up. I love having card guts around.

 
Stamp Set: Touch of Kindness

Paper: Old Olive, Very Vanilla, Cherry Cobbler, Watercolor paper, Baja Breeze, Old Olive DSP

Ink: Jetblack Stazon, Sahara Sand, Crumb Cake, Tempting Turqoise, Baja Breeze, Soft Suede, Pumpkin Pie, Daffodil Delight, Cherry Cobbler, Old Olive, 

Misc: Pinking Hearts border punch, Striped Basic black ribbon,finial press embossing folder, jewelry tag punch, vintage trinkets

See how the punch is longer?

 
I showed you how to do that a while back, here it is again in case you missed it.

 Birds&amp;Fish 
 
 

When I was looking around the internet trying to come up with some quick and cute cards this one stood out big time by Danielle Daws, and I knew I wanted to do it. I only changed it a tad, by layering and changing the ribbon, but that is it. Thanks for the cute card Danielle.

 
I love the Aviary set and I had it to work with for my Convention demonstration this year, and it is so much fun. So that is probably why I loved the card, it is I guess you would call it monochramatic, and it is pretty quick to do, I did use the stamp a ma jig to get my bird cages lined up and to put the little bird in the cage, oh and yeah the greeting too...have I ever told you how much I love my stamp a ma jig? Don&apos;t you?

 
Stamp Set: Aviary, Apple Blossoms

Paper: Very Vanilla, Basic Black

Ink: Sahara Sand, Basic Black

Misc: Striped Basic Black ribbon cut in half

So the other day when I showed you this card , I said I would show you how I got the longer jewelry tag punch and I totally forgot so here it is...oh and I did the fish tail too...

 

 

My laptop has a movie maker or something on it, so I want to see what it does, I didn&apos;t have time to do anything but upload the video so nothing fancy schmancy with it.

Did you watch American Idol? If not, stop reading.

I really liked how they did this and I am very excited for the people they picked, I am glad that Clint, the red headed guy and Rachel are gone, they were horrible. I wish the dark haired Lauren could have been around longer but other then that, it was great. I am glad Stefano and James are together, as they seem pretty tight.

I am excited for this year, and even though they are starting out with 13...eww...not a lucky number, I think this year is gonna be good. I think the guys are pretty strong. I think it will come down to Lauren, Pia, James and Scotty near the end, that&apos;s just my two cents.

Well I better hit the hay, I got a busy day tomorrow, I got cupcakes to make (real ones, not the balls) for Saturday and errands to run, so this old gal better get some shut eye.

Have an awesome Friday and thanks so much for stopping in!

Some Kind Words
 
 
&quot;Thanks for the video. Have been wanting to do this and once again...you have inspired me. :)&quot; - Gladys 
&quot;Thank you so very much for continuing to show samples and &quot;how to&quot; instructions and videos of your fantastic and creative projects. I can&apos;t even express how much it is appreciated.&quot; - Kim 
&quot;You totally crack me up girl. I love you, and we have never met.&quot; - Wilma 
&quot;If I wasn&apos;t a demonstrator already, I&apos;d be joining your team. :) Thanks for always sharing your ideas and excitement for SU! My upline quit several years ago, so I&apos;ve been blessed to have sideline sisters that help and encourage. Convention was a blast... like a bunch of crazy family getting together for a reunion! now I&apos;m going to &quot;go, go, go&quot;... LOL&quot; - Shelly 
&quot;I highly recommend this tutorial. I have dabbled with water coloring and didn&apos;t think I was too bad at it, but this tutorial has a number of helpful tips in it that immediately helped improve my technique. Even with the low price, I was apprehensive to purchase it because I felt a video was needed. You have managed to do it with a very reasonably-priced PDF. I am sorry I didn&apos;t purchase it sooner.&quot; - Dorrie
