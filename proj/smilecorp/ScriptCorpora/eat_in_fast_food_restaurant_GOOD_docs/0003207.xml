Kids help clean up Castlemilk Park

 May 18 2011 by Carla Callaghan, Rutherglen Reformer 

PUPILS from two Castlemilk schools have helped clean up a local beauty spot with the help of a fast food restaurant.

In conjunction with McDonald’s, children from St Bartholomew&apos;s and Miller Primary School helped to clean up Castlemilk Park.

The 66-strong team donned high visibility jackets and armed themselves with litter pickers to cover the area.

Undeterred by the torrential rain, McDonald’s franchisee, Kate Walker and her team ensured the area was free of all litter, regardless of its origin, collecting over 20 bags of rubbish throughout the morning.
 
The event, organised by Castlemilk McDonald’s Business Manager Adrienne Nelson with the backing of Glasgow City Council, was held in support of Keep Scotland Beautiful’s National Spring Clean campaign.

Delighted with the pupils’hard work, Kate Walker said:“I would like to thank St Bartholomew&apos;s and Miller Primary School pupils, our Business Manager Adrienne Nelson, the local council and our staff for all their help and allowing us to make this happen.

“We’ve all got a responsibility and I think if we all contribute to tackling the problem then litter can be reduced in our community.

“We all know that litter is unsightly and causes a damaging effect on our environment, and litter picks are a chance for local people to give their community a sense of civic pride.

“I feel it’s important my colleagues and I do our bit to stop litter blighting the area and help restore those places in need of a spring clean.”

Donna Hegarty, Programme Manager at Keep Scotland Beautiful, added:“Our thanks go to all the McDonald’s staff who have already committed to picking up some litter this spring to return their local area to a litter free zone. But there are still a large number of unclaimed open spaces and we’d encourage everyone to consider helping out and making this year’s National Spring Clean the greatest ever–don’t leave it for someone else–grab a litter picker and join in!”
