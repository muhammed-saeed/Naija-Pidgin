I have gone at lunch a couple of times. We got back to work on time. The service isn&apos;t too bad. The food isn&apos;t too good. The chips and dip are great though. The music was comparable to a German Speed Rock Band (described by a co-worker).

Golden China Tips
 Cheap lunch, great food!
 
Sarah M. If you get an order to go, DON&apos;T call it in. They cook the food way too fast! Order at the counter and you&apos;ll wait about 5 minutes. Seriously
 
Jamie G. Crab Ragoons are the best! :)
 
Jessica P. Best place for lunch. Super cheap&amp;super good.
