 A Slice of Heaven 
 The best things often come in small packages. That&apos;s exactly what I got after trying out a cupcake from this newly opened store beside Jamba Juice.  
 While I was waiting for Gus to get off work, I chanced upon this stall beside his workplace. I assumed it was just a temporary stall since a bigger place behind it with the same name was being constructed. Thank God for boredom. Since I had nothing to do while waiting, I decided to take a look at the different cupcakes and cookies they were selling.  
 Being a baker myself, curiosity got the best of me. I wondered how one cupcake could cost as much as the ones I was seeing. It looked like regular cupcakes. I assumed people were also paying for the place where it was being sold, thus the unusually high price of each cupcake. I got one without asking what it was. I just picked the most classy-looking cupcake I could see. 
 I picked a chocolate cupcake with rosette icings on top, which, judging from the color and texture, was made of caramel. I paid P60 for a cupcake that looked like another cupcake I usually buy for P11. But, I had to find out. Was it worth my P60? 
 
 
 Chocolate Yema Cupcake (P60) 
 The answer is a big, fat YES! The first bite was all it took. The cupcake was so full, the icing, to die for. The cupcake was filled with cake, not just air. It was heavy, unlike other cupcakes I tasted. I knew this was real cupcake. Not just aired batter baked to perfection. And the caramel rosettes? Turns out it was yema. Cooked condensed milk. The sweetness complimented the rich chocolate flavor of the cupcake. It wasn&apos;t a battle between two sweets. It was a union of bitter and sweet. 
 Wow, I can&apos;t believe how poetic I sound describing this cupcake. It really is a must try. No wonder this was their best seller. For P60, this is definitely worth it!  
 Grab yours at Slice Bonifacio High Street. They are currently on their soft opening, so you can also taste their other non-sweets specialties like the Brown Arroz Caldo, and Seafood Puttanesca. 
 Price Range: P60-110 (for the baked goodies -- cupcakes and cookies) 
 5 out of 5 for Slice (their staff were very friendly and accommodating)

 안녕, Jang Ga Nae 
 For our monthly date, Gus and I decided to go Korean. We were supposed to try Ye Dang, but we decided to check the Korean carinderia I was telling him about. We didn&apos;t end up eating there because he wanted a Korean place where he could grill the samgyeupsal himself. We eventually found ourselves in one of the more formal restaurants along Escriva Drive, which had table grills -- Jang Ga Nae. 
 Since we were both very hungry, we immediately ordered what we were craving for: bibimbap, and samgyeupsal. While waiting for our meals to arrive, the server brought us a pitcher of cold tea (yes, cold tea!) We were actually surprised, but very pleased, with the cold tea. It was the first Korean restaurant we&apos;ve been to, which served cold tea instead of just plain water. 
 Cold Tea 
 As much as we were pleased with our drink, we were a bit bothered because no one had served us our appetizers yet. We started to look around to check if the place served appetizers, even just a small plate of kimchi, but saw none. We started to wonder if this Korean restaurant would also be the first to NOT serve appetizers. Thankfully, after a couple more minutes, someone arrived with four plates of appetizers -- sweet potatoes, beansprouts, pickled cucumber, and the traditional kimchi. Not long after the server left, another one came with another set of appetizers -- tofu, another kind of kimchi, AND Korean pancake. Yes! They served pajeon as an appetizer! And that&apos;s not where it ends. After thinking that all the appetizers have been served, the server came with a big bowl of salad! 
 
 Appetizers 
 After the surprising appetizer attack, we were also served with two bowls of soup. This was very new to us because we usually just get appetizers whenever we dine in a Korean restaurant. No complaints though. We loved it. Around 10 minutes later, our meals arrived. Sadly, Gus still wasn&apos;t able to grill his own samgyeupsal because the restaurant only allows table grilling if you order two or more servings of samgyeupsal , or any other meat. We got his samgyeupsal already grilled, with big lettuce leaves, fresh garlic, and sauce to accompany it.  
 
 
 Samgyeupsal (P240) 
 My bibimbap came soon after. It didn&apos;t have any meat in it. Just pure vegetables, rice, and egg. It was a bit surprising because I was used to eating bibimbap with a little meat in it. It was good bibimbap, although I still prefer Korea Garden&apos;s bibimbap. 
 
 Dolsot Bibimbap (P300) 
 A few minutes into our main dishes, which we enjoyed greatly, we realized how full we already were. The appetizers were so filling we almost didn&apos;t get to finish the rest of our food. But we still finished everything to the last piece of meat! And of course, the meal won&apos;t be complete without dessert. We enjoyed a refreshing slice of pineapple to cap off our meal. For free! 
 Free dessert! 
 The verdict? MUST TRY. You will surely be satisfied after eating in this Korean restaurant. They have a generous spread of appetizers, the food and service was great, and they had warm towelettes at the end of the meal. A very filling meal for P600. Little pleasures in life. 
 Price Range: P250-400/person

 Eat My English 
 At first glance, one would think that this little hole-in-the-whole restobar is of Korean origin. With Korean restaurants and karaoke centers surrounding it, one would be quick to assume that this too, is a Korean establishment. It is not. Eat My English is a restaurant/bar that serves affordable Filipino, and American dishes, alcoholic beverages, and your usual pulutan (snacks to go with your beer/shots). 
 We chanced upon this restobar while looking for a 24/7 restaurant that serves Beef Steak or Beef Tapa. The name of the place caught our attention so we decided to have a look-see. To our surprise, they offered both at very reasonable prices so we decided to stay and check the rest of the menu.  
 I decided to get my Beef Tapa, as originally planned. For only P98, I got crispy beef tapa, egg, and garlic rice. The tapa was really good, a mix between salty and sour, not the typical sweet tapa other restaurants would offer. Their vinegar mixture complimented the salty/sour flavor of the tapa. The garlic rice was real, garlic rice. Not just a cup of rice topped with garlic flakes. However, the serving was not enough for one meal. I had to roder an extra cup of rice to finish my food. 
 Tapsilog (P98) 
 Gus ordered Pork Binagoongan. Their version of binagoongan was a real &quot;must try&quot;. The sauce was a dish on its own. As they would say in Filipino, &quot;Sauce pa lang, ulam na.&quot; It was so good, he also needed an extra cup of rice to finish everything. This meal is only P85. 
 Pork Binagoongan (P85) 
 While waiting for our food, we decided to try their kropek. Their serving of kropek came with two kinds of sauces -- vinegar, and peanut sauce. Surprisingly, the peanut sauce complimented the kropek. You can also try mixing both sauces for a different twist. The price is a bit steep though. 
 Kropek with Peanut Sauce (P95) 
 Since both of us are soup people, we decided to try their Clam Soup. They were very generous with the clams that we both thought that this was a good buy for P110.00. However, don&apos;t expect anything special with this soup. It is just your regular bowl of clear soup with sauteed clams. But don&apos;t get me wrong. It was still delicious.  
 Clam Soup (P110) 
 We are definitely recommending this place for those who want to chill/relax after a hard week&apos;s work. They have good, inexpensive food, and alcoholic beverages (Yes! Inexpensive beer can be found here), though the rice serving on the meals is a little less than your usual, you might need an extra cup. The ambiance is also not as good as your typical restobar though, but still, it&apos;s something you can bear, considering the inexpensive food and drinks. 
 Price Range: P100-150/person

 Best Friends Pares and Mami House 
 It&apos;s been a while since my last update. I&apos;ve a lot of entries waiting to be published, but I just don&apos;t have the time to finish all of them yet. Fortunately, I&apos;ve some time to finish one today.  
 A few months back, Gus and I decided to try this &quot;pares&quot; house along Aurora Blvd. It looks like your typical pares house -- simple tables and chairs, open air, fancy/colorful designs, and tiled floors. If you haven&apos;t seen other pares houses, you might think this is just a fancier eatery, or sidewalk restaurant. But don&apos;t let it&apos;s cutesy, or simple exterior fool you. Best Friends Pares House offers delicious, inexpensive meals fit for a king!  
 Gus ordered the Beef Pares Meal, which came with a bowl of soup, two pieces of siomai, and UNLIMITED rice. All for the very low price of P89. 
 
 Beef Pares with UNLIMITED Rice 
 I ordered their Lechon Kawali Meal, which also came with a bowl of soup, a side dish of chopsuey, and a big cup of rice. As you can see in the photo below, their chopsuey serving was good enough for one more meal, not just as a side dish. Their serving of rice was also bigger than your usual cup of rice. All this for just P89 too. 
 
 
 Lechon Kawali Meal with Chopsuey 
 Best Friends Pares and Mami House prides itself in serving clean, delicious, and affordable meals, which, in our opinion, they succeeded in doing so. The food was delicious, we had everything we needed and wanted in a meal -- a bowl of hot soup, vegetables, more rice, and the assurance that what we were eating was clean food. For those midnight cravings, or spontaneous dates, drop by Best Friends Pares and Mami House for a delicious and affordable meal. They are located along Aurora Blvd. just a few block away from the Anonas LRT Station. They are open 24 hours.  
 
 Price Range : P50-100/person

 MUA Experience 101: The First of 2012 
 This is my second attempt, a successful one I guess, at being a &quot;make-up artist.&quot; My fried needed someone to do his model&apos;s make-up for one of his photoshoots. Since I am also an amateur at what I do, he decided to let me do the make-up of his model (he&apos;s a budding photographer) so I can practice my skills too. His theme was something along the lines of fierce. Here is my attempt at making Iza, the model, fierce. 
 I began prepping her face by applying a primer all over. I used Skin Food&apos;s Black Egg Pore Primer . I then combined Etude House&apos;s Nymph Aura Volumer #2 with Skin Food&apos;s Peach Sake BB Cream #2 in a 1:3 ratio. Skin Food&apos;s Peach Sake BB Cream, I think, is best for girls with a more Filipina-like complexion. It is not too white, and it doesn&apos;t make the skin look oily after application. 
 For her cheeks and lips, I used Tony Moly&apos;s Backstage Sure Tint in Peach (02) . It made her cheeks and lips look very much alive, but not in an overpowering sense. I also added a drop of the Nymph Aurora Volumer on top of her cheeks to give it a certain glow. 
 For her eyes, I lined it with a thick layer of Maybelline&apos;s Waterproof Gel Liner , for that rockstar, I-am-fierce effect. I finished the whole look by dusting Majolica Majorca&apos;s Skin Remaker Pore Cover in OC20  all over her face, and neck. 
 
 Again, I am still getting to know make-up so don&apos;t expect expert-like make-up results. Here she is. :)

 MUA Experience 101: December 2011 
 I am no make-up artist. I just enjoy hiding my pimples, pimple scars, EYEBAGS. That&apos;s it. The first time I learned about make-up was sometime during my late elementary years. My best friend was a looker. And with that, she possessed different sized, and colored foreign objects. A cylinder with colored, &quot;clay-like&quot; paint inside, pink powder, powder that came with a built in mirror, black, sticky liquid that&apos;s supposed to make your lashes longer, etc. Being the nerd that I was back then, I never really knew what these were, and what they were for. All I knew was that, these things make a woman, beautiful. Oh yes. For a smart kid, I was pretty shallow and stupid. 
 Now that I know just a little bit more about make-up, I was asked by my boyfriend&apos;s sister to help her put some on for a friend&apos;s debut. I am not promoting myself as a make-up artist, nor is this a tutorial. I&apos;m just documenting my first ever, official make-up session with someone else. I have yet to learn so much more about make-up, and creativity before I can teach others professionally, or make a living out of it. For the pros out there, constructive criticisms, and tips are very much welcome. :) Here is my first try at being a make-up artist.  
 Model : Gin Yu 
 Products Used : Skin Food Black Egg Pore Primer, MAC Studio Finish Concealer in NC20, Etude House Precious Mineral All Day Strong BB Cream in Sheer Glowing Skin #2, Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer #2,  herbench/ Paintbox PrettyWhenPinched, MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation in NC30, (not shown in photo)  Majolica Majorca Jeweling Eyes Eyeshadow Quad   in PK785 . (Model&apos;s Own)  IN2IT  Eyeshadow Duo in CE39 Natty, Fashion21 Eyeliner in Black, MAC  Frost in AC9. 

 
 I prepped her face by applying Skin Food&apos;s Black Egg Pore Primer. From what I&apos;ve been told, this will help the make-up stay longer on her face. I evened out the color of her under eye area with the rest of her face by applying concealer on it. I used MAC&apos;s Studio Finish Concealer in NC20, and applied it using a &quot;tapping&quot; motion. After applying concealer, I combined EH&apos;s Precious Mineral All Day Strong BB Cream #2 with their Nymph Aura Volumer #2 in a 3:1 ratio, and smoothed it all over her face. The volumizer will give her look a certain &quot;glow&quot;. 
 
 I let her make-up set for a while before applying a dot of herbench/&apos;s PrettyWhenPinched on her cheeks. I got a small amount of EH&apos;s volumizer, and spread it on top after. I wanted to make her cheeks glow, not just rosey matte. 
 
 
 Gin applied her own eyeliner on the upper waterline of her eyes since I wasn&apos;t too confident in applying eyeliner on that part of the eyes, and because this is where she usually applies it so there was no way I could line her eyes for her. Since I have yet to master the art of applying mascara, I decided to leave that out, and just curl her lashes the primitive way. Good thing she has long eyelashes, leaving the mascara out wasn&apos;t such a big deal. :) I proceeded with coloring her lids using IN2IT&apos;s Duo Eyeshadow in CE39 Natty. I swept a golden yellow shade all over the lid, and added a brown shade from the middle to the outer corners of her eyes. I used a pearly white shade from Majolica Majorca&apos;s PK785 palette to highlight her browbone.  
 
 For her lips, I used MAC&apos;s Frost Lipstick in AC9. I finished the whole look by dusting MAC&apos;s Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation in NC 30 all over her face. 
 
 
 So, what do you think? ;)

 Hello, ladies. Meet your new best friend: Jeunesse Anion Sanitary Napkin 
 Last Christmas, I was introduced to a new product. I was supposed to promote the product before it hit the shelves, but I&apos;ve been busy with other things lately that I haven&apos;t had time to write. But, late is better than never, as they say. I am proud to introduce to you all, Jeunesse -- a new sanitary napkin that will amaze women everywhere. Yes, I use the word amaze because that&apos;s how I felt when I saw the demo of this product. 
 
 It looks like any other sanitary napkin, only thinner. It comes in two kinds, day, and night, and before you pass judgement on this thin napkin, let me tell you how absorbent it is. That&apos;s what&apos;s important to us, girls anyway, right?  
 
 
 Day Pad. Actual product. 
 Jeunesse uses a super-absorbent polymer, which makes it retain more liquid. It also has an anion strip, which helps eliminate odor. Compared to the others I&apos;ve tried, this is by far the most absorbent sanitary napkin I&apos;ve come across. I&apos;ve seen it work its magic with my own two eyes, and it&apos;s what got me convinced. Yes, yes. With stuff like this, it&apos;s hard to believe without actually seeing. So, for the benefit of the people reading this, I&apos;ve documented the little absorption experiment I did on this napkin. See pictures below. :) 
 I used colored water to make the experiment results easier to see. Two sheets of tissue paper were used to check the absorption rate of the napkin. 
 I poured three tablespoons of the colored water onto the pad. 
 This is what three tablespoons look like.  
 This is how the pad looks like a few seconds after. 
 The experiment. 
 As you can see, the two sheets of tissue paper I used were not as wet as one would expect a minute after pouring the liquid. There were tiny dots, but that&apos;s as much of the wet part you&apos;ll see, even if you try this experiment yourself. 
 The result. See for yourself. 
 Now, is that pad absorbent or what? 
 Jeunesse Anion Sanitary Napkins are available in Watsons branches.

 cheers for really cold beers: Wing Hub 
 One thing I really appreciate is a bottle of cold beer and inexpensive (not overpriced) pulutan , or drinking food, to go along with it. I&apos;m one of those people who just has the need to drink randomly to relieve stress. A bottle will do. But it has to go with something I can munch on. 
 
 
 Last October 21, we discovered this place amidst an array of drinking places in Metrowalk that served really inexpensive, Beer-Below-Zero. In the Philippines, Beer-Below-Zero or BBZ, is the term coined for really cold beer. Beer with a temperature of below zero, thus the product name. These are usually priced more expensive at around P55-60 (around $1.40) a bottle, or an additional P5 ($0.12) per bottle of your beer&apos;s regular price (if a bottle costs P45/$1, BBZ would cost P50/$1.20). This place is located beside Marina in Metrowalk, and it&apos;s called Wing Hub. 
 
 
 
 Beer Below Zero and Potato Wedges (P40 and P45) 
 For a pub that serves BBZs, this was a definite to-go place. Their beers-below-zero only cost P40 a bottle. You can also enjoy a basket of really good, freshly cooked potato wedges or french fries for only P45. If you want more than just potatoes to go along with your beer, or if you have no intention of drinking, this place offers more choices. From buffalo chicken wings, to sizzling gambas, to sweet treats like cheesecake. Plus, the staff are really friendly, attentive, and efficient. They&apos;ll have everything you need in a minute. With a smile on their face. Visit the place and explore it yourself. :) 
 Price Range : P85-300/person

 when cravings attack: Moshi Moshi 
 Last year was a year of cravings. It was the year I craved for the perfect fresh lumpia, the perfect green mangoes with shrimp paste, the perfect orange quail eggs, and so many more cravings I wanted to satisfy. One of these cravings included a Japanese favorite -- gyudon. It started with one of our foodtrips in Megamall, where the gyudon I had tasted so sweet. From that day on, I&apos;ve been craving for the perfect gyudon taste that will satisfy my taste buds. Nothing too sweet, nothing too salty, nothing bland. After months and months of searching and trying out different gyudons from different restaurants, I found one very close to home. 
 
 We decided to drop by Moshi Moshi to check the place out. It&apos;s a new Japanese restaurant located in the heart of Katipunan, right across Ateneo de Manila University. It was an interesting Japanese restaurant because they not only serve Japanese food, they also sell some Japanese food products like Kit Kat in Strawberry, Melon, and Cookies and Cream flavors. The interior was quite different from most Japanese restaurants I&apos;ve been to. It wasn&apos;t formal, it wasn&apos;t too modern, or too zen, it felt like Japan, but not really. The restaurant&apos;s interior and lighting made you feel fresh, with its green theme, grassy area, and bright lighting. It makes you feel relaxed and at peace, without the common zen, or black and white features. 
 
 
 
 Now let&apos;s get down to the food. We only ordered three dishes because it was a bit late already, and they were about to close. My craving, Beef Gyudon; my favorite Japanese dish, Kani Salad; and milk tea. 
 
 I had the Kani Salad, and honestly, I had a bit of a hard time eating it because the lettuce was not shredded. It was arranged garden salad style, with the lettuce leaves piled one on top of the other. But that did not discourage me. I had to know if this Kani Salad was worth going back for. I plunged my fork into the pile of lettuce, crabstick, and mangoes, and took a bite. Yes, the lettuce leaves made it hard for me to just chomp the whole thing down, but, the effort was worth it! They nailed it! The right combination of all the flavors and the JAPANESE mayo on top! The mangoes weren&apos;t too sweet and they weren&apos;t too bland in taste too, so everything just made the whole thing delectable. It was also a very big plus that they used Japanese mayo. It makes Kani Salad taste even more delicious.  
 
 
 
 Kani Salad (P99) 
 Gus had the gyudon but he made me eat some of it because of my constant craving in finding the perfect gyudon, and he thought I might like this one because &quot;it wasn&apos;t sweet, and it had just the right saltiness to it.&quot; True enough, this gyudon was really good. Better than the previous gyudons I had, which were either too sweet or just weird in taste. I enjoyed eating the gyudon too much that I didn&apos;t notice I had finished it already. It is just a bit more expensive than most gyudons but I think it&apos;s worth it. The quantity made up for its P170 price. 
 
 
 
 Beef Gyudon Level Up (P170) 
 Finally, the milk tea. We heard that the milk tea was not good so the management had to tweak it a bit, but when we finally tasted it, it tasted pretty good. I was expecting weird tasting milk tea, something either too bitter to taste like tea or something close to the taste of water, but no. If I had to choice among the drinks Moshi Moshi offered, I&apos;d still choose my milk tea. 
 
 Milk Tea (P55) 
 So what&apos;s the verdict? Is this place worth going back to? Definitely. For a simple late night dinner, we really enjoyed the food. The staff also greeted us with very warm smiles that it made our stay even more enjoyable. Who would want to have dinner in a place with rude and snotty attendants, right? Moshi Moshi is the right combination of good food and good service. With the bonus of having really good and relaxing ambiance. Check it out for yourself! 
 
 Price Range : P150-250/person

 midnight adventure: Emperor&apos;s Dimsum and Teahouse 
 This entry marks the end of the backlog of blog entries I have for 2011. Start the year right by getting rid of the old stuff, right? :) 
 I shall begin with our midnight adventure last September 30, 2011. Oh, I guess this is one of our anniversary dates since it was on the 30th. We usually go out and celebrate our monthly anniversaries by discovering new food. Anyway, it was a midnight adventure because we had this at around 12:30 am. We were hungry, and looking for a non-fast food restaurant that was still open at that time. If I remember correctly, I was craving for some hot rice and a real, unprocessed, dish to go with it. Since we were in the Greenhills area, we decided to take a look at Emperor&apos;s Dimsum and Teahouse, and ended up having a filling midnight snack. 
 The food attendants served hot tea and pickled vegetables, which were oh-so-good, while we were looking at their menu. I&apos;ve always loved how they automatically serve hot tea after sitting. The pickled vegetables I&apos;ve only noticed now, but maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;ve always been excited when ordering xiao long bao from this restaurant. I guess I finally took notice of it when Gus started eating it, and I&apos;m glad I finally paid attention. The pickled vegetables were really good! A good way to start your eating adventure! 
 Pickled Vegetables (free of charge) 
 House Tea 
 After looking through their menu, we ordered a serving of xiao long bao. We always, always, order at least one serving of dimsum whenever we go Chinese because we both love dimsum, and because the xiao long bao in this restaurant is also one of my favorites. It&apos;s the first xiao long bao I&apos;ve tasted here in Manila that closely resembled the one I fell in love with in China four years back. It wasn&apos;t dry, and the inside was really soupy. Soup-filled! If I&apos;m not mistaken, xiao long bao is known for the soup inside. Most of the xiao long baos I&apos;ve tasted here in Manila fail in that aspect, but not Emperor&apos;s. You will definitely feel and taste the soup inside. The filling is also good. Not too little, not too much, and the taste compliments the soup. A serving has six, big, soup-filled pieces, all for the low price of P98. Trivia: Around two-three years back, it was only P88/serving. :) 
 
 Xiao Long Bao with Red Vinegar Sauce (P98) 
 After ordering our dimsum appetizer, we were finally able to decide which main courses to get. Gus wasn&apos;t that hungry so he got a serving of Fish Fillet in Beancurd Sauce Rice Topping. He found the dish really good, he finished it in such a short while, even if he wasn&apos;t that hungry. He asked me to try it and even if I wasn&apos;t in the mood for fish that night, I found this dish really good too. Not too salty, not too bland, and with just the right mix of fish fillet and vegetables, which were NOT soggy.

 If he got seafood, I got pork. To be honest, I was choosing among a number of dishes. Dishes that ranged from noodle and rice, dry and wet, chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, but in the end, the name of this dish caught my attention so I ended up getting it. I ordered the Steamed Pork Spareribs in Lotus Leaves. Thankfully, this dish was so good, I didn&apos;t regret getting it. Even if it was steamed, the spareribs was so full of flavor, it was a joy nibbling on it. Just a little of it made me eat so much rice! I found the presentation interesting too. It was so fun eating this dish.

 Overall, our Emperor&apos;s Dimsum and Teahouse experience was great. The food was good, the service was good, and the price was very good. We only spent around P420 for all these delicious and filling dishes, and we had no problem with the service. The staff was quick and efficient, and they were very attentive to our needs despite the hour. 
 Price Range : P150-200/person
