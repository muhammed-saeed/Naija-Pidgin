	<description>you try to order flarn at a fast-food restaurant. ... you keep seeing Babylon 5 explode in your cup ... you try and drain energy from life support</description>
	<body>
		YOU KNOW YOU&apos;VE BEEN WATCHING BABYLON 5 TOO MUCH WHEN...


 your hairstyle matches Londo&apos;s. your sexual fantasies include Delenn. your color is hot pink. you believe that in a past life you were a member of the Grey Council. you can&apos;t shake the feeling that DS9 is B4. the only ancient history you know is Babylon&apos;s. you pretend to blackmail Londo. there is a hole in your mind. you think vulcans are members of the Psi Corps. you wonder who would win a fight between a Minbari and a Vulcan. your .newsrc contains only the line &quot; rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5:
 1-183406 &quot;. you keep saying &quot;data crystal&quot; instead of &quot;diskette&quot;. you finger sinclair@b5.mil.ea and wonder why doesn&apos;t it
 work. ... then you remember that he&apos;s now sinclair@ea_embassy.minbar.gov . ... it doesn&apos;t work either, and then you conclude it must be a problem
 with the nameserver. ... so you try valen@ ... aw, skip it! someone uses insecticide, and you shout &quot;Do you wanna kill N&apos;grath? Are
 you mad?&quot;. ... then you don&apos;t understand why everyone stares at you. you try to watch Mutai fights on ESPN. ... you actually call them to complain about it. you want to brain wipe someone you really hate. you think Darth Vader is a Vorlon. you think Chekhov was really Bester doing an undercover spying mission. you want to become member of the Third Fain of Chudomo. you believe the Grim Reaper is a soul hunter. you wonder what did Captain Kirk do during the Earth/Minbari war. you want to know if there are any xenobiology courses in med school. you ask politics experts wether Al Gore has got the flu already. you are upset because CNN doesn&apos;t report anything about Ragesh 3. you wonder what&apos;s wrong when you calculate your age as&gt;300. your biggest worry is Narn expansionism. ... but recent events change that to Centauri expansionism. you fart, and that makes you think of Vorlons. you keep on thinking what went wrong in the Battle of the Line. your first son has just been born, and you can&apos;t think of any names other
 than Londo, Lennier and Kosh. you pretend to spend some vacations on Mars. ... and book a reservation on the Red Planet Hotel. your dreams include something scary about flutes made up of bones. you&apos;re afraid that your soul will escape if you&apos;re cut open. you think Ivanova is God. you ask the Air Force recruiter about the Starfury Training Program. you go to the produce section of the grocery store and ask if their spoo
 is fresh. your wardrobe consists of nothing but white, military-pressed collarless
 shirts and military pressed slacks. you wonder who would win a testosterone battle between Garibaldi and Tim
 Allen. you tell the plastic surgeon you want to have an operation to make you an
 anatomically correct Centauri. you have a bumper sticker that says &quot;My other car&apos;s a Starfury&quot;. you have a bumper sticker that says &quot;Warning: Fully loaded Cobra Bay in
 trunk&quot;. you have made a PPG. you start scouring the world to try and find enough Quantium-40 to make
 a jump-point generator. you change from zip then fasten to fasten, then zip. your WWW client&apos;s hot list has over 100 entries and 95% of them point to
 Babylon 5 pages. you keep a notepad and pencil next to your bed so that you can write down
 what Kosh says in your dreams, should Kosh happen to appear. ... and you go through at least one notebook a week. ... and to be sure, you also write down everything your father says in
 your dreams. at work, you don&apos;t go to strikes because of fear of the Rush Act. you go asking everyone &quot;What do you want?&quot;. you wonder why Lt. Barclay bears a striking resemblance to that demented
 war vet in Downbelow. ... and you wonder how Bester and this war vet got to different
 Enterprises in different centuries via the same rift that ate B4. the phone rings, and instead of picking up the receiver you tap the back
 of your hand. you go to the aquarium and wonder if there&apos;s any significance to the fact
 that there&apos;s a kind of fish called the Garibaldi. you call your cable operator and ask what cable package comes with ISN. you are watching Letterman when the camera flashes to the audience. Two
 women are sitting quietly, not laughing at the jokes and wearing black
 gloves. You immediately shout, &quot;Psicorps!&quot;. you wreck your car on the highway by spinning the wheel fully around
 while traveling at 80 miles per hour, trying to imitate Sheridan as he&apos;s
 leaving the station in All Alone in the Night . you wonder where the hell is that clean, efficient Minbari power source
 for your new motorcycle. you catch yourself looking for rangers in the background while watching
 an opera. you skive off work just to see what the TV listings magazines have to say
 about the new episode within an hour of them appearing on the shelves. you call your travel agent and try to arrange passage to Minbar and get
 directions to the Earth embassy. you&apos;re planning your vacation, and the only place that appeals to you is
 Molari State Park. you bite into some fried chicken and say, &quot;Hey, tastes just like Narn!&quot;. you see &quot;Norton utilities for people&quot;, and your brain sees &quot;Morden
 utilities for people&quot;. you&apos;d like to introduce your sister to Lennier. you begin fantasizing political conspiracies at your family reunion. you wish you could stand up when driving your car. the entire weekend is devoted to preparing and eating one meal. while watching football, all the blockers look kinda like Kosh. conversing with a Star Wars fan you claim that &quot;My Shadows can kick your
 Dark Side&apos;s butt&quot;. Barney and Baby Bop look like a viable alien race. ... until you realize that one is purple, and the other is green. you begin to wonder if Bester and Deanna Troi are related. you fantasize about how JMS would have written The Andy Griffith
 Show . you realize that the &quot;Psychic Friends Network&quot; is actually the PR
 division of the Psi Corps. you are spending the night in a shelter to wait out hurricane Erin, and
 your only thought is &quot;I&apos;m going to miss Babylon 5 tonight for sure!&quot; you are disappointed that your newspapers religion page doesn&apos;t list a
 Foundationist church. your dreams don&apos;t simply include B5 characters and scenes, instead they
 are full new episodes. you trust the Psi-Corps, because the Corps is your friend. you try alligator at a restaurant, and all you can think of to say is
 &quot;Tastes like Narn!&quot;. you have always been here. you go to the basement and expect to find a moment of perfect beauty in
 the darkness. you look for airlocks to shove irritating people through. &quot;Scrag &apos;em&quot; and &quot;Space &apos;em&quot; have become part of your normal vocabulary. you call B5-related conversations &quot;dis-kosh-ion&quot;s. you think genies were Shadow agents. you back off whenever people ask &quot;What do you want?&quot;. you see a spline-based screen saver, and immediately wonder if Abel Horne
 has just interfaced with Control via that computer. you actually try to make sense out of which side the red thing on
 Ivanova&apos;s uniform is facing on a particular episode. you turn a mis-printed M&amp;M upside-down and see the Psi Corps logo
 instead of an &quot;m&quot;. you ask jewelry stores if they carry gravity-control rings. you offer to bring the little pieces of red fruit to a friend&apos;s wedding. ... and then can&apos;t keep yourself from saying &quot;And so it begins&quot; during
 the ceremony. you wonder wether Cylons have anything to do with the Shadows. you wonder wether Starbuck is a ranger. you&apos;re not thinking what you&apos;re thinking. you&apos;re bored of paying taxes for subsidizing those martian twits. you get a headache and wonder if you&apos;ve been through Sector 14. you start wondering why Oliver Stone didn&apos;t mention the Psi Corp&apos;s
 involvement in the Kennedy assassination. buying candy from a vending machine, you buy whatever is at selection B-5
 (or you at least look there). ... because B1, B2, and B3 are broken. ... and the candy in B4 disappears before you can press the button. you cut yourself just to verify your blood is red - not yellow or
 green. Quentin Tarantino appears on a call-in program, and you call to ask if it
 was Ambassador Kosh in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction . you look up the name &quot;Morden&quot; in your local phone book. ... and when you find one, you call him up and ask him to have his
 associates pay a visit to the Warner Bros. exec who decided to delay
 broadcast of the final four season two episodes. ... and then you start reading the obituaries in Variety hoping to see news that a Warner Bros. exec died under mysterious
 circumstances. you start dating someone because when you ask &quot;What do you want?&quot; they
 reply &quot;Never ask that question!&quot;. ... and later break up over a green/purple argument. you are watching ALIENS and you think the Alien queen is really one of
 the Shadows and wonder how Ripley is going to see her through its
 &quot;invisibility&quot; screen. you constantly call all world governments to come together before the
 coming of the Shadows. you feel you&apos;re being nibbled to death by cats. at a relative&apos;s deathbed, you begin forming a wall of bodies, in case a
 Soul Hunter appears. you see a beautiful girl wearing purple smiling at you, but decide not to
 approach her because you&apos;re wearing green and realize that it could never
 work out. you commit murder because you were disturbed while watching it. you are shopping for a new vehicle and the only ones that you are
 interested in are Ford Rangers and Dodge Shadows. ... and you ask the salesman to demonstrate the hyperspace capabilities
 of the Dodge Shadow. ... but you hesitate when you realize that once you&apos;re in one of those
 things you&apos;re never... quite... the... same... (but you do as you&apos;re
 told!) ... and you make sure your wife WON&apos;T get anywhere near one of those. you look for Mr. Garibaldi to hug when you&apos;re feeling insecure. you want to build a statue to Zathras. your car sings to you while you&apos;re sleep. you ask people &quot;Who are you?&quot;, and when they don&apos;t answer correctly, you
 stick their fingers in an electrical socket. you rack your brain trying to figure out how the Forces of Light are
 going to defeat the Shadows, especially considering how dangerous the
 Shadow ships are to other ships. you check the WWW Lurker site every day for the latest news, and spend
 your lunches and breaks at work studying the home page sections. you have memorized Signs and Portents and The Coming
 of Shadows , after having seen each episode on tape about a hundred
 times. you have memorized an enormous quantity of B5 trivia, and consider
 yourself an expert on the subject, even challenging people to quiz you on
 anything about the show. you plan an expedition to Z&apos;ha&apos;Dum to rescue Sheridan&apos;s wife. you consider killing President Clark yourself, but then realize that it
 wouldn&apos;t really help the situation. you threaten someone you hate with the phrase &quot;You will know pain, and
 you will know fear, and then you will die.&quot;. you actually have said &quot;Absofraginglutely&quot;. you want a &quot;Ba-bear-lon 5&quot;. ... then you hijack a shuttle and search for THE &quot;Ba-bear-lon 5&quot;. you wonder why the UN has not passed a resolution condemning the Centauri
 for their aggression and use of outlawed weapons. you want UN peacekeepers sent to the Narn homeworld. you accidentally cut yourself and all you can say is, &quot;Dead, Dead,
 Dead...&quot;. you check for Narn before entering a elevator. you try to buy a TV station that runs B5, and then try to have its call
 letters changed to KOSH. you don&apos;t trust anyone named &quot;Sebastian&quot;. you panic when someone asks &quot;Who are you?&quot;. you look for an investigative reporter to do an expose&apos; on the
 Nightwatch. you put a Vorlon on top of your Christmas tree. you start looking for &quot;attributes&quot; on your stomach. you have just been thru a life threatening situation and all you can
 think of saying is &quot;Thank the Great Maker.&quot;. you decide that your wife would look good bald. you begin to become attracted to Vir. you start talking to household appliances and your car. you see the headlights of an oncoming car and you think it&apos;s a couple of
 Vorlons. you begin wondering when the rangers are going to overthrow the Grey
 Council. you wonder how to hide a Narn war cruiser in your backyard for sanctuary. you begin to plot the death of Psi Corps for what they did to Talia. you mark the upcoming episode titles in your datebook. you decide it&apos;s better not to tell yourself what it is that you do not
 need to know. entering a church, you find the Holy Water but can&apos;t help wondering where
 the Minbari and Human blood is. while driving, you suddenly have an irresistible urge to &quot;punch it&quot;. your boss tells you he expects you to read his mind and you immediately
 suspect he may be a Psi Corp spy. you are suddenly afraid of your own shadow and want to ask Delenn what it
 means. you start having romantic feelings for G&apos;Kar. someone asks you what time it is and you reply, &quot;It&apos;s the dawn of the
 third age...&quot;. you listen to the music instead of the song when you seek for meaning. you arrange a meeting with someone at the hour of scampering. you are happy now that the case of Jack the Ripper is finally closed. you consider the possibility that the world is right and you are wrong. instead of pulling the emergency brake in a train, you tap the back of
 your hand and shout &quot;Computer, emergency override! Open train doors!&quot;. you consider a strain on you to be seen by many people. you start referring to your children as &quot;pouchlings&quot;. you think NRA means &quot;Narn Resistance Alliance&quot;. the only day that has any meaning is the day when B5 is telecast. you start growing coffee in your closet under grow lights. the highest compliment you can give your girl/boy friend is that they
 look like a &quot;dream given form&quot;. you toss off proverbs like: `A little learning is a three-edged sword.&apos;. you&apos;re angry that you can&apos;t find a bar that serves Jovian Sunspots. the only senator&apos;s name you can recall is Hidoshi. you wonder how the Millennium Falcon can go into hyperspace without a
 jumpgate. your goal in life is to become a technomage. you name your newborn daughter Delenn. your bedroom starts looking like the Downbelow. people get irritated by your talking in Vorlonesque statements - you
 always say &quot;good&quot;. you think the FBI has been remiss in not using monks to seek out the
 Unabomber. you&apos;re driving on the Cross Bronx expressway, and upon seeing the exit
 for the Sheridan expressway you think &quot;Wasn&apos;t Sheridan born in 2214?&quot;. you go to the sporting goods store to get a cat hunting license. you refuse to go into a bar because you fear that even a small amount of
 alcohol will cause you to go into a homicidal rage. you ask your doctor about getting gill implants. you go to your local flower shop to special order a G&apos;Quan Eth plant. you wonder wether the Wookies are members of the League of Non-Aligned
 Worlds. you see a spider on your wall and the first thing you think of is how
 much it looks like a Shadow ship. ... then you&apos;re afraid to smash it for fear of being cut in half by a
 purple ray. ... Heck, you aren&apos;t even going to touch it with your bare hand! ... Then you concentrate your thoughts on the spider in an attempt to
 make it go away. you reverse a .wav of the season 3 theme and play it back to check for
 secret messages or Shadow voices. you change your hairstyle to match Delenn&apos;s. you accuse your co-workers of being PsiCorps and Nightwatch plants, and
 your boss of being a Shadow agent. you&apos;re playing Battleship and you grin knowingly whenever someone calls
 B5. you can&apos;t get hot water for your shower, and you wonder if you&apos;ve done
 anything to piss off Ivanova. you&apos;re watching a news report on the Bosnian peace talks, and when they
 show a map showing how the country is to be divided, you swear that the
 borders are shown outlined in flame. you are tempted to mindwipe your rebellious teen so you can start over. you fear the midterm is going to explode if you don&apos;t answer all the
 questions. you search your local bookstores continuously trying to find a copy of
 the Book of G&apos;Quon. you step into an elevator and say &quot;Blue 2&quot;. ... and then you wonder why this travel tube doesn&apos;t respond to voice
 commands. you classify your days as &apos;arc&apos; or &apos;non-arc&apos;. you stare at pennies far too long. you try to collect people&apos;s fears using a video recorder. you dream about friends speaking cryptically while birds are perched on
 their shoulders. it takes weeks for you to recover after you read a mention of the
 excellent &quot;psych program&quot; at CLARK University. your Netscape&apos;s home page is http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/whatsnew.html . you start to find Narn females attractive. you make octopus spaghetti because you&apos;re expecting Drazi visitors. you&apos;re watching &quot;Golden Eye&quot; and think the line goes, &quot;Only three men I
 know use a Walther PPG. Two of them are scragged.&quot;. you think Santa Claus is a Shadow agent because he always asks &quot;What do
 you want?&quot;. you think The Fugitive deserves a makeup Emmy - G&apos;Kar made a
 very convincing one-armed man. somebody calls you a bonehead, and you retort &quot;But I&apos;m not Minbari!!!&quot;. you avoid answering questions by impersonating Mollari and saying, &quot;When
 the room stops spinning.&quot;. you think that calling someone a liar is a capital offense. you tell your girlfriend she&apos;d look great with a bone hairpiece. you see a commercial for Motel 6, and then you spend the next half hour
 wondering what happened to Motels 1 through 5. after watching the end of Screamers , you wonder what did
 Sheridan know in There All Honor Lies . you look up the word &quot;Vorlon&quot; in the dictionary to find clues to the
 story arc. on the subway, you inspect the seats of other passengers after they stand
 up, just in case... you want to know if the evil teacher you despise is still out sick, so
 you ask your friends &quot;Have the Shadows returned to Z&apos;ha&apos;dum?&quot;. ... and you talk about B5 so much that they actually know what you mean
 and who you&apos;re referring to. you have been seen wandering around mumbling something about how &quot;a lack
 of information can KILL you&quot; on the day of final exams. your 330M hard drive holds over 73 megs of B5 video, audio, and texts...
 and counting. you have used the phrase &quot;... because you can&apos;t have larger
 ideals if the smaller ones are compromised&quot; at least three times on essay
 tests. you ask your AP physics teacher how to build a jumpgate. you start ending your prayers with &quot;In Valen&apos;s Name, Amen.&quot;. people ask you where you are, and you reply &quot;The name of the place, is
 _________&quot;. in a game of DESCENT, when you&apos;re cloaked and about to nail somebody, you
 send the message: &quot;Watch out for Shadows. They move when you&apos;re not
 looking.&quot;. your 6-character ATM code is &quot;B5KOSH&quot; you refer to caffeine sodas as &quot;stims&quot;. you have a bumper sticker that says &quot;Sheridan/Ivanova for 2264&quot;. a friend of yours won&apos;t tell you a secret he knows, and you think &quot;If I
 only could get a Dust dose...&quot;. the idea of digging in your backyard more than a few inches scares you to
 death. you yell at the television when the characters on the show violate Earth
 Force protocols, and you&apos;re watching DS9. you break off a friendship with someone because you find out he&apos;s a
 NightWatch man. you are a student, yet you look forward to autumn because you know the
 new season of Babylon 5 is going to start. you feel all smug after eating scrambled eggs. ... and then you tap the back of your hand and say &quot;Hey, Sheridan, guess
 what I just had for breakfast?&quot;. after watching Messages From Earth , you think back to War of the Worlds and realize that H.G. Wells was right
 about keeping an eye on Mars. you prop up one end of your bed so that it&apos;s inclined about 45 degrees. ... but you sleep safely in the knowledge that someone will catch you if
 you should fall. in Physics class, you refer to your studies regarding optical principles
 as &quot;The Geometry of Shadows&quot;. you make a note to remember to dust yourself off once in a while. you start looking for the Pak&apos;ma&apos;ra section in the mens&apos; restrooms. your university&apos;s PR department decides they must review all WWW pages prior to posting, and you begin calling
 them the Nightwatch. ... when asked why the Computer Science department itself is subject to
 the PR department&apos;s approval, you answer &quot;Because we have lost our teeth,
 and we have forgotten how to bite.&quot;. ... and then you seriously consider locking them all up in one room to
 convict them of unconstitutional behavior. you want Narns on the police force. you want to kill Barney the Dinosaur by dropping him into a room full of
 Drazi. you ask your history professor if he&apos;s considered joining with one of
 those Vindrizi thingies. you call your friends in for a code 7R. you spend so much time outside of your body that you sometimes forget
 where it is. you are watching your old tapes and start playing &quot;Spot the Markab&quot;. you put a bucket on your head and impersonate the ancient Vorlon god
 Boojie. your cordless phone picks up interference, and you think there are
 Shadows on the line. being reminded of someone you dislike, you scream &quot; &lt; that
 dude&apos;s name &gt; tavotna chog!&quot;. every time you take out a butter knife you cut your hand as Narn
 tradition dictates. you&apos;re reminding a Calculus student of the definition of the hyperbolic
 cosine function, and you experience a mysterious impulse to begin
 answering all questions with useless vague monosyllables. you see an article in a travel magazine extolling the ancient cities,
 art, and social tolerance of a foreign country, and you feel compelled to
 rewrite the article. you start referring to Geneva as &quot;Earthdome&quot; and you use &quot;Homeworld&quot;
 instead of Earth. you chant &quot;Za ba ga bee&quot; in front of your motorcycle. your favorite hockey team is the New York Rangers, even though you live
 in Pittsburgh. your favorite baseball team is the Texas Rangers even though you live in
 Kansas City. your favorite soccer team is the Glascow Rangers, and you&apos;re Catholic! you&apos;re writing about the Underground Railroad for history and you type
 &quot;telepaths&quot; instead of &quot;slaves&quot;. you start wondering when Scully and Mulder will capture a Shadow. you think the Worm might be the Nexus&apos; evil twin brother. you go out and try to collect donations for the families of the
 Churchill&apos;s crew. you use a short sword to kill cockroaches. as you kneel before the porcelain altar, your one comforting thought is
 that it can&apos;t be a real hangover, otherwise you would not remember it! you express mortification by gasping, &quot;In Valen&apos;s Name!&quot;. you think that the show starring Roma Downey and Della Reece is called
 &quot;Touched By a Vorlon&quot;. you see anything with a snake light attached to it, then you back away
 slowly. you make sure those aren&apos;t eyeballs spread on your toast. government inspectors come to visit your area of your worksite, you put
 a hand on your forehead, lift it and look at it. ... and when they leave, you banefully say, &quot;They&apos;re here.&quot;. everything makes a very satisfying thump (or did I mention that?). your shoes are too tight and you have forgotten how to dance. you think regret can be harvested. you start using the verb &quot;to butt&quot; in your conversations. you start reciting the Lord&apos;s Prayer and it comes out, &quot;Our Ivanova,
 which art in Heaven...&quot;. you have a dream in which your guardian angel appears to you, and it&apos;s in
 an encounter suit. your dirty sexual fantasies start to include Morden. you&apos;re disappointed because your computer doesn&apos;t sound like Harlan
 Ellison. your computer does sound like Harlan Ellison. you write Betty Crocker to get advice on how to prepare spoo. you reach for your usual breakfast cereal, Basic 4 (which you often
 abbreviate as B4), and then a scratchy voice in the back of your head
 suddenly declares, &quot;Breakfast not Zathras skill.&quot;. you register a domain with DNS just so you can post to USENET from youhavealwaysbeenhere@babylon5.org . every day, in the locker room, you change the combination on all of the
 4-digit locks to read &quot;2260&quot;. ... then plan to change it to &quot;2261&quot; when season 4 starts. you expect 36-hour long news reports. you begin seeing your own death in your dreams. ... and a one-eyed Narn has an active part on it! you wonder why PBS doesn&apos;t show any Narn opera. ... then you think it must be because the PBS executives prefer Centauri opera. you want NASA to name its next space shuttle the &quot;White Star&quot;. you wonder if the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet damaged the transfer point on
 Io. you see someone you don&apos;t like and fear a glowing triangle will appear
 on your forehead. you look in the Bible for references on how to fight Shadows. you start taking vibe showers because your house can&apos;t handle that much
 water. you spend countless hours researching what exactly are the first two
 ages of mankind. you keep a Narn translator at your side when reading the bible. you think that Obi-Wan was a technomage. you&apos;re in perpetual fear of tomorrow&apos;s boom. you practice Vir&apos;s finger-wave, in case you ever happen onto Morden. you fantasize about having a surgically implanted bone on your head. you try to book passage to the rim. you put wires on your head hoping to become a pilot for a Shadow ship. your worst nightmare is walking into C&amp;C naked. you start thinking of Minbari drinking games. you really get what Kosh is saying. you look for animals in the sides of Vorlon ships instead of doing it on
 clouds. you think that F-16 pilots are Gaims working for the Air Force. you wonder wether Predators dare to hunt down Shadows. someone attacks you, and you expect to find a PPG lying on the floor. you think that Mulder and Scully are doing a very bad job - after all,
 undeniable proof of extraterrestrial life has been widely known for about
 a century. you suspect that the Streibs were the ones who kidnapped Mulder&apos;s sister. you wonder what did C.S. Lewis know about Narn history. you expect people to suddenly take off their face and reveal they&apos;re
 Drazis with a mask. you say Or-Londo instead of Orlando. you can&apos;t get the words &quot;Signs and Portents&quot; out of your head. you cancel vacation plans so that you don&apos;t miss Babylon 5. your teacher gives you a large assignment without explaining why, and
 you have the urge to shout &quot;UP YOURS!&quot;. ... a while after that, he appears in your dreams apologizing. you wonder what kind of insurance discount you can get for installing the
 Vorlon Defense System in your car. ... and you try to find out if there&apos;s an option package on the Ford
 Ranger that includes it. the player for your team strikes out, you mutter &quot;not the one&quot;. the phrase &quot;Six of one, half a dozen of the other.&quot;, sounds like an
 obscene Centauri joke to you. your will stipulates that when you die, your clothing is to be placed
 next to your car. you look out the window at a skyscraper and wonder whether it&apos;s big
 enough to open its own jump point. you move into your new apartment, notice that the next street over is
 named &quot;Sheridan&quot;, and consider relocating there. you go spelunking in canyons trying to find an access way to the heart of
 the Great Machine. you petition NASA to rename the international space station as Babylon 1. you pull your car into a public parking structure and surrender control
 to C&amp;C&apos;s docking computer. ... and then explain to the person you crashed into how substandard chips
 caused the collision. ... and when they ask you how your car flipped over, you explain that
 the chips didn&apos;t properly match the rotation rate of the parking
 facility. you announce that your floor is seceding from the rest of the company. ... and for the rest of the time you wear black outfits at work. ... and you charge the mailroom rent! you call up the local radio station and request &quot;Too Shy&quot; by
 Koshagoogoo. you wonder why Oliver Stone never investigated the death of President
 Santiago. you become strangely obsessed with oranges. you wonder why you&apos;ve never seen Lady Morella and Ambassador Troi
 together. you like to sing &quot;Vorlons We Have Heard on High&quot; at Christmas. the phrase &quot;a pain in the neck&quot; has sinister connotations. the introduction to the old radio program The Shadow leaves
 you in a fetal position. you call a Packers/Vikings game &quot;The Drazi Bowl&quot;. you try to summon a person by attaching a car battery to a full set of
 their clothing. every morning, when you must carry everyone&apos;s bags out to the car, you
 recite &quot;Zathras used to being beast of burden for other people...&quot;. a friend goes against your advice, takes a certain course you already
 took, and gets a horrible grade, you repeat the phrase &quot;I tried, I tried
 to WARN them... but it all happened, just the way I remember it...&quot;. you could swear for a second that the comments on your SAT diagnostic
 say &quot;Mathematics not Zathras skill&quot;. you wear black for a month after viewing Interludes and
 Examinations . you get extremely drunk in order to determine if you have a Shadow
 &quot;Keeper&quot; attached to your neck. ... and then you actually think you can see it from the corner of your
 eye. you go to the travel agent to plan a trip to New Vegas. you are the hand. the man in between is searching for you. you think the theme from 2001 is &quot;Also Sprach Zathras&apos; Sister&quot;. you go to Staten Island just to see the Garibaldi Museum House. in an attempt to experience what it&apos;s like to live on the station, for 36
 hours you lock yourself in the largest clothes dryer you can find and set
 it on the highest possible speed. your friend returns from Jerusalem, and you keep on touching him, his
 clothing, his luggage... ... and, of course, his plants! you have completely customized your computer with B5 wallpapers, sounds,
 icons and screensavers. ... and you are not the least bit embarrassed! your entries on this page are in the double digits. you rent every movie in which a B5 regular appears. encrypting data, you can&apos;t think of any passphrase other than &quot;Hello old
 friend.&quot;. ... and after some serious thinking come up with &quot;peekaboo&quot;, &quot;socks&quot;,
 &quot;fasten&quot;, and &quot;zip&quot;. you can&apos;t stand how the government keeps acting as though there was
 nothing of interest happening outside Earth. ... but keep it to yourself as you realize that publicly criticizing the
 government is not the wisest thing to do these days. you see a book by Alfred Bester and discard it as Psi Corps propaganda. driving in the road, you&apos;re surrounded by trucks, and you start screaming
 frantically &quot;Not like this! Not like this!&quot; and try to crash one of them. you go door to door looking for telepaths to help you in the upcoming
 Shadow war before Psi Corps can snatch them and ship them off to the
 Shadows. ... and then when your own family has you committed you start blabbing
 something about ISN and a conspiracy within the government and the chain
 of command. during a weekend trip to Escondido, California, you check in at the
 Sheridan Inn, and are a bit startled to see that the staff isn&apos;t dressed
 in spiffy black-and-gray uniforms. you wonder why common everyday words like &quot;Minbari&quot; and &quot;Z&apos;Ha&apos;Dum&quot; aren&apos;t
 in your spell checker. your spell checker actually recognizes words like &quot;Minbari&quot; and
 &quot;Z&apos;Ha&apos;Dum&quot;. you pass a road sign and you think it reads &quot;... your last, best hope for
 gas and food next 200 miles.&quot;. you expect to be able to buy only the sections of the newspaper you&apos;re
 interested in, just like Universe Today lets you do. you see someone that has a sore throat and dizziness, and you run away
 screaming something about a black angel. ... and when you see that the other persons in the area are doing nothing
 about it, you realize they&apos;re accepting their fair punishment. you&apos;re kidnapped, and you expect to be rescued by an Omega class
 destroyer. ... and expect to be helped by a Narn while trying to escape. you try to buy a Universe Today copy at your local newspaper
 stand. you refer to the 5-month period when no new episodes are shown as &quot;the
 great darkness&quot;. you are afraid that making a hole in the floor of your house could breach
 the hull and kill you. ... so you have a porthole installed in the floor and expect to see a
 starfield when you look through it. you pretend that your TI-82 graphing calculator is an identicard scanner. you answer the phone saying &quot;Garibaldi&apos;s Fashion Express, go.&quot;. you keep trying to remember if it was Romeo that was purple and Juliet
 was green, or the other way around. ... then get mad when your English professor doesn&apos;t know. every time your wife picks up a snow ball, you expect someone to startle
 her opening the door, causing her to drop and shatter it. you name your unborn son David in hopes that he&apos;ll be born with a Minbari
 crest. your boyfriend leaves for a long journey, and you implore him not to go
 to Z&apos;Ha&apos;Dum. you want to go somewhere, but you don&apos;t feel safe leaving home without a
 time stabilizer. you&apos;re ticked off that you can&apos;t buy Minbari fighting sticks in America. ... and as a result you go to Japan to continue the search. you try to open fuseboxes by saying &quot;I don&apos;t believe in luck.&quot; and
 turning your back on them. you drive 2 hours to your in-laws&apos; house to watch next week&apos;s episode on
 satellite - then drive home right afterwards. you visit where you used to work, but hide from your best friend in order
 to protect him. you&apos;re watching The Sentinel , and wonder why Marcus Cole
 lied about how his brother died. you start playing multiple characters on a MUD, naming your warrior
 Sheridan, the cleric Delenn, the mage Valen, the Psionicist Bester, and
 the ranger Marcus. you start confusing the DS9 wormhole with a jumpgate. you shave your head and get tattooed to look more like a Narn. you decide that NightWatch is behind the Communications Decency Act. you try to order flarn at a fast-food restaurant. you become extremely agitated when you can&apos;t find a listing for the
 Zocalo in your local phone book. ... and you then turn your house upside down looking for the 2259/60
 edition. you&apos;ve memorized G&apos;kar&apos;s &quot;need for freedom&quot; speech. ... it&apos;s been your .sig file for the last few months. you start printing your homework on transparencies. you&apos;re having second thoughts about that &quot;face on mars&quot; thing in the
 tabloids. the letter Psi causes pain. you get real nervous when CNN goes off the air because
 of technical difficulties. you wonder why the Mutai is not in the Olympics. you start dancing and singing around someone when they talk about sex. you wonder if Dax was a lurker before she was joined. your computer&apos;s startup message is &quot;You have always been here.&quot;. ... and the shutdown message is your father&apos;s voice saying &quot;It&apos;s alright
 son. As long as you&apos;re here, I&apos;ll always be here.&quot;. you see an &quot;EA&quot; in an old-style script on a business card and your first
 thought is &quot;I didn&apos;t know Clark changed the seal of the Earth Alliance
 when he came to power.&quot;. you and your wife are invited to a party and your reply is &quot;When it is
 time, come to this place. Call our name. We will be here.&quot;. we were right about you. you stand between the candle and the star. seeing someone in a green and purple shirt causes you a moral dilemma. before you start work at a new office, you have to give a good luck
 speech. you submit a TV series idea to Aaron Spelling called &quot;Charlie&apos;s Vorlons&quot;. you flunk your history final because you list the sixteenth US President
 as being Abrahamo Linconi. you read all the entries and you laugh all the way to the end, when
 suddenly you are gripped by fear at the realization that 307 of them
 apply to you. you won&apos;t let your girlfriend touch your snowglobe. your Christmas presents are pieces of scrap metal. you train in Centauri battle tactics when you&apos;re playing Descent. ... and in Descent 2, you re-enact the Battle of the Line with plasma
 cannons and afterburners. ... and then you use the Omega cannon and pretend to be a Vorlon ship. you wonder if the Jem&apos;Hadar will help in the battle against the
 Shadows. ... then realize the Dominion works for the Shadows. the only e-mail you&apos;ve received in the past few months has been from
 various B5 listservers. you buy a Packard Bell computer and in a little while find yourself
 mumbling &quot;Zathras can never have anything nice.&quot;. you go to an adult video rental store and ask if they have any Centauri
 porn movies. you arrive at gate B4 of the airport, and are not surprised to see that
 your plane has disappeared. ... so you conclude it must have been taken back in time to help win the
 Crusades. ... and then it dawns on you that you were supposed to leave from gate
 B5, because sooner or later everyone goes to B5. you start taking Ivanova lessons. you wonder if Jack-in-the-Box is serving Pak&apos;ma&apos;ra cuisine. before you put on new clothes, you tell a secret and give something away. you&apos;re in the middle of fifteen things, all of them annoying. you wonder why the Narn aren&apos;t participating in the Olympic Games. ... then you realize they refuse to go in protest for the Centauri-Earth
 non-aggression treaty. you can&apos;t help but wonder why there is not a single Drazi in free-style
 wrestling in the Olympic Games. you wonder what does the Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy say about the
 Shadows. ... and you&apos;re sure that its entry for Z&apos;Ha&apos;Dum is &quot;Mostly Harmful&quot;. you want to send the Vogon Constructor Fleet to get rid of that damn
 planet once and for all. you continuously think about what would happen to a Minbari that drinks a
 Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster. you want to drink hot jala instead of tea. you refuse to go aboard a boat named &quot;Icarus&quot;, because one from the
 crew looks just like Morden. every time you see the word Modern your mind reads Morden. you&apos;d rather have a gok than a cat. you think that you can NEVER watch too much B5. you walk past the ornamental duck pond at work and refer to the cute
 Centauri cats. you take an exceptional interest in Olympic rowing, held at Lake Lanier. you wonder why Centauri fencing is not an Olympic sport. you&apos;re reading the side of a bottle of vitamins and you understand why
 there is no vitamin B4, but you wonder why there&apos;s no vitamin B5. ... then you begin to wonder what vitamins B1, B2, and B3 are doing
 there. you histerically call &quot;Mitanu&quot; someone who&apos;s been on surgery. you believe John Gray&apos;s bestseller is called &quot;Men are from Mars - Women
 are from Minbar&quot;. you&apos;re whole life has been leading to this. you ask your doc for some stims because you plan to watch B5 episodes the
 whole weekend. someone asks you: &quot;Do you understand?&quot; and you say: &quot;No, but
 understanding is not required, only obedience.&quot;. you wonder if Garibaldi is in the elevator before the door opens and you
 enter it. you want to buy starlaces for your girlfriend. ... then you remember that it is difficult to buy them in a shop and you
 want to grow them for her. you wear black gloves even in summer. you think YOU are a telepath and are trying to run from Psi Corps. you think the Holy Trinity consists of Sinclair, Delenn, and Sheridan. you write to Kenneth Starr, demanding that he investigate President
 Clark&apos;s illegal activities. you read about the Raiders moving back to Oakland, and you are surprised
 since they were destroyed in Signs and Portents. you wonder what wine you should serve with flarn. you want the World Court to indict Lyndisty for war crimes. seeing a football player&apos;s helmet fly off after a hard tackle causes a
 flashback to the Battle of the Line. you can&apos;t decide between a G&apos;kar, a G&apos;van, or a G&apos;pickup. you wonder why do Pernese dragon riders have Narn names. while attending Yom Kippur services, you hear Londo&apos;s voice in your mind
 saying, &quot;Fasting, prayer and repentance? This, by you, is a good time?&quot;. you go into a restaurant and order breen. ... and the owner actually knows what it is because you&apos;ve been ordering
 it ever since you first saw Walkabout . you try to stay close to the Vorlon. you watch out for Shadows because they move when you&apos;re not looking at
 them. you feel all that remains now is honor and death. you want to hide a na&apos;ka&apos;leen feeder in your boss&apos; apartment - and
 call it &quot;just an April Fools&apos; prank&quot;. you spend long nights wide awake in bed contemplating on how many Vorlons
 can dance on the tip of a flame. your sexual fantasies involve a menage-a-trois between yourself, Talia
 and Ivanova. you plan a holy pilgrimage to Ivanova&apos;s birthplace. you call up toy companies demanding them to make Babylon 5 action
 figures. ... and tell them to make sure the Londo figure anatomically correct! you hold parties where you request everyone come barefoot. you think Madonna sings &quot;Like a Vorlon&quot;. you feel as though you&apos;re missing out because, as a human, you know
 you&apos;ll never get past &quot;one&quot;. the only interjection you use is &quot;not good&quot;. you look at people through drinking glasses so you can see the light
 refracting their soul. you call up the hair salon to make an appointment with Ivanova on
 Tuesday. you pass a billboard that says EA on it and you wonder what the Earth
 Alliance is advertising THIS time. you see a cloud in the shape of a huge hand reaching out and you wonder
 how you got into Londo&apos;s dream. inside an elevator, you take the time between floors. you handcuff yourself to your computer and call yourself Draal. your favorite song is The One by Elton John. ... and you call up your local radio station and have it dedicated to
 Delenn. you try to mail a huge box of freeze dried coffee to the B5 command staff
 for Christmas. your wedding gown looks like one of Delenn&apos;s outfits. ... heck, so do all the rest of your clothes! you buy yourself an old Chevrolet Nova, refurbish it, and add the letters
 &quot;IVA&quot; to the beginning of its name. you&apos;re more interested in Sheridan and Delenn&apos;s lovelife than your own. ... what lovelife? You gave that up to watch more Babylon 5! you go to the optician and order red contact lenses. the most pressing question on your mind is why the Shadows are not called
 Z&apos;ha&apos;dumians or Z&apos;ha&apos;dumites? you wonder if a Vulcan high priestess can reunite the missing piece of
 Kosh with his old ship. you watch reruns of Scarecrow and Mrs. King and decide that
 Sheridan was recruiting her for the Army of Light. people refer to Australia as downunder and your mind hears it as Down
 Below. you mess up on a recipe for a cake and you have to go back and start over

 laboratory reports because you&apos;re afraid the Earth Alliance will use them
 to make a biological weapon. you suspect the failed NASA probe to Mars was really captured by the
 Shadows, and NASA placed a homing beacon on the probe so we could follow
 it to Z&apos;ha&apos;dum. you&apos;re doing a marketing project for your internship and you&apos;re shocked
 to find that there are Fortune 500 companies named Valen Manufacturing,

 Narn Bat Squad. ... and you can&apos;t find one, so you start your own. every time you are introduced to a John, Jeffrey, Michael or Susan you
 mentally supply them with the last name of Sheridan, Sinclair, Garibaldi
 or Ivanova. you think about what it would be like to have dinner with Morden. you dream about a night with Londo. you envy Delenn because she married Sheridan (or vice-versa). you think YES&apos; song &quot;Hearts&quot; is a pro-Centauri song, because it clearly

 very first time you watch it. you swear to wash your own socks to keep Sargent Slaughter happy. you&apos;d rather drink bravari than any other alcoholic beverage. ... and when you do, you fear you&apos;ll suffer a heart attack. ... and you believe that saying you&apos;re sorry should be enough to get rid
 of the hangover. you quit coffee in order to get G&apos;Kar to lend you his book. you ask where the Shirley Temple is located. your have an inner voice that smiles. a friend of yours is assaulted and almost killed, so you decide to apply

 Beginning in the fiction/sci-fi section. ... so you put it where it belongs - the reference/world events. you&apos;ve driven all through car lots, airports, chop shops, etcetera,
 looking for a used starfury. you listen to the song In The Beginning from the movie Anastasia and realize they apply to John and Delenn. you go to your club, and you swear the front sign reads &quot;All MINBARI Must

 say: &quot;It was the dawn of the third age of mankind...&quot;. you hear the Steely Dan song &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot; and you think of Lizzie
 Sheridan. you turn on your cellular phone, and the message that appears is &quot;5 -
 BABCOM&quot;. you find a restaurant called &quot;Garibaldi Pizzas&quot;, and enter to ask wether
 they got Bagna Cauda in the menu. a student of yours, that hasn&apos;t worked in all the semester, asks you what
 does he have to do in order to pass, and you tell him [with a straight
 face] &quot;The avalanche has already started; it&apos;s too late for the pebbles
 to vote.&quot;. you petition the Ministry of Defence to re-equip the Air Force with
 Starfuries. you think that it was a Shadow talking when your modem got connected to
 the Internet. you&apos;re watching 2010 , and when they are near Io you think
 that they will run into the jumpgate that is over there. you don&apos;t trust anything or anybody that has the Clark name attached to
 it/him. you hold bi-monthly meetings debating wether JMS or Ivanova is the TRUE
 god. ... and you don&apos;t think it&apos;s strange that you&apos;re debating it with a bunch

 chess set (and even have recommendations as to which character should
 represent which piece!). you start running the tapes backwards to see if you&apos;ve missed anything. you get sued, and retain the law firm of Morden&amp;Associates to
 represent you because you know they can get you what you want. your company relocates you to Southern California, so you decide to move
 to VALENcia. you can only recite Emily Dickinson poems to the tune of The Yellow
 Rose of Texas . you watch the new Lost in Space movie and can&apos;t get over the
 fact that Will Robinson is building the Great Machine, Dr. Smith turns
 into a Shadow, and the first robot looks like Kosh&apos;s encounter suit! you begin referring to your karate instructor as the Muta-Do. your sexual fantasies include Sheridan. you&apos;re setting up a Windows NT network, and you name the NT Domain
 &quot;EPSILON3&quot;. ... and you name the primary domain controller &quot;DRAAL&quot;. ... and then you establish a trust relationship with the &quot;BABYLON5&quot;
 domain. ... and assign rights to users JSHERIDAN, SIVANOVA, and DELENN in the
 BABYLON5 domain. ... and you wonder why you can&apos;t name your workstations ZATHRAS, ZATHRAS,
 ZATHRAS, ZATHRAS, and ZATHRAS with slight differences in pronunciation. you make a Ranger fighting pike out of a toilet paper tube. ... and you carry it around with you everywhere you go because you never
 know when you might run into one of Morden&apos;s associates. ... and any time someone tries to break into your house, or steal your

 Lady of the Lake having a bone on her head. you refer to your vehicle as a Carfury. you look behind the mask that you are forced to wear and see only

 night! every time you leave a room, you picture a ship jumping into hyperspace. you do a presentation of it every time it&apos;s your turn in Acting class. you want to do your term paper based on Babylon 5. you brush your teeth with your fingers (preferably in gloves). ... and make a habit out of gulping the water afterwards. sometimes you think that the &quot;messiah&quot; in deep impact looks like a white
 star. you like the song Summer in the City just because of the
 line &quot;doesn&apos;t seem to be a shadow in the city&quot;. your jokes all end with the punchline &quot;zoot zoot&quot;. you sit for hours pondering the questions &quot;who am I&quot;, and &quot;What do I

 coworkers. you think your bombing Narn but your really throwing meatballs at your 5
 year old son. you blame the Shadows for El Niño. you blame the Vorlons for El Niño. you automatically assume that all companies with ASSOCIATES written in
 the name means that they are working for the Shadows. whenever you hear Sinclair speak in season 3, you write it on a mirror,

 drive on it. ... and then wonder if it ends in a dead end. you call Saint Michael &quot;Entil&apos;Zha&quot;. you walk into a dark room and say, &quot;Lights!&quot;. you contemplate the idea that JMS might BE God... ... but if he&apos;s an atheist, then that means nothing exists... upon bumping into someone, you babble, &quot;much apologizings - was thinking
 great thoughts - did not see you!&quot;. while rummaging through your disorganized toolbox, you grumble, &quot;this -
 is wrong tool&quot;, until you find the right one. as head altar-server in your church, you decide to call your trainees

 message. you phantasize about Lyta, Ivanova, Delenn, Talia and you alone on an
 island. your favorite song is I&apos;m the Very Model of a Modern Major
 General ... even though you don&apos;t care at all about Gilbert and
 Sullivan. you book your buddy and yourself on a hotel as honeymooners so nobody
 would suspect anything. you remember the time when your mother said she had eyes on the back of

 humans really went. you drop out of a diplomatic career, fearing an ambassador may require a
 physical &quot;sealing&quot; of the agreement. your Winamp playlist includes every track from every Babylon 5 CD ever
 made. ... and when one song ends, you start humming the next. you turn off the computer, and spend the rest of the day humming them. In
 order. your idea for a college thesis is why Deep Space Nine is ten times worse
 than Babylon 5. ... but you discard the idea because you feel it needs not to be proven. any time you speak to someone you end your conversations with: &quot;Stay
 close to the Vorlon and watch out for Shadows: They move when you&apos;re not
 looking.&quot;. you name your thesis on Morgana le Fay &quot;A Late Delivery From Avalon: Who
 is Morgana le Fay?&quot;. your Early English History Prof talks about the great council being made
 up of only warriors, and you wonder if Valen knew about this. whenever you are up between 3 and 4 am you pour yourself one tall glass
 of vodka, and four short ones - for the wolf&apos;s cubs. you spent your vacation checking all of JMS&apos;s posts about Talia winters
 to make a logical decision about whether or not she and Ivanova were
 lovers. you frequently ask friends if they&apos;ve received any messages from your

 speech about aligning the races. you wake up screaming, because you are still shocked from the
 Minbari/Earth War. you still cry at the end of Sleeping in Light after watching
 it a hundred times. you decide to take all of your money off your account and put it into the
 REAL telepath fund. every morning you wake up to watch the sunrise and think of John. ... and raise your left hand at the sun. you encourage you children to play tennis like Mary Garibaldi does. you start taking Sunday drives. you think the song Me and My Shadow should be called &quot;Me and
 My Shadows&quot;. ... then you wonder if it was Morden&apos;s favorite song. you think the song Born Free is really &quot;Born Vree&quot;. you name your newborn son David and you make him a little Minbari bone to
 wear on his head. ... and you make him keep it on indefinitely. you start a stop smoking program in honor of Neroon and use the Morden
 motto &quot;Quit while you&apos;re ahead...&quot;. you think the Jem&apos;Hadar look too much like the Drakh for their own good. you think Amnesty International doesn&apos;t understand the concept of &quot;human

 in light. you get a new copy of the AOL 4.0 software and exclaim &quot;I didn&apos;t know

 just looking for a better life. you refuse to run software from Electronic Arts because you know that the
 EA has been inflitrated by the shadows and you don&apos;t want to use shadow
 tech. ... and you&apos;re also worried that the software would contain subliminal
 messages from the Psi Corps. you find a new virus on your computer and you wonder what you did to
 irritate a technomage. you have to stop yourself from ordering spoo in a restaurant. ... because you remember that you better ask the waiter how fresh it is
 first. you refer to your backpack as being &quot;Omega Class&quot;, then when you get a
 new bigger backpack, you call it &quot;Warlock Class&quot;. you call the black and white chess-pieces &quot;Shadows&quot; and &quot;Vorlons&quot;. you plan to have your body cryogenically frozen with instructions to be
 revived in the year Babylon 5 goes online. ... the purpose of this is so you can save Marcus Cole from his written

 Room, where as Eric Clapton says, &quot;the shadows run from themselves&quot;. seeing the end of season 5 is your sole reason for existence. &quot;OH my gosh!&quot; turns into &quot;OH my KOSH!&quot;. you listen to the song Into the Fire from the Scarlet
 Pimpernel because you think it&apos;s for B5. you believe that King Crimson&apos;s famous song is called &quot;23rd Century
 Schizoid Narn&quot;. you petition the Department of the Treasury to re-print all of the money,
 because it says &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, and not &quot;In Ivanova We Trust&quot;. you begin taking calcium supplements, hoping that you&apos;ll grow an

 &quot;Babylon&quot;. you think the ship Red Dwarf is actually Babylon 4. you wonder why Zack never sang Ebony Eyes to Lyta. after counting the number of times the word &quot;shadows&quot; occurs in every
 song, you conclude Jimmy Page must have been an &quot;associate&quot; of the
 Shadows while he was with The Firm. you try and get JMS to put Major Atumbe in Crusade, just so you can see
 what he looks like. you spend hours trying to think of a way of writing a character you play

 shadows will be at your back.&quot;, and that totally ruins your day. you appreciate Swedish meatballs as a culinary masterpiece. you think I Walk the Line by Johnny Cash is an elegy in

 breakdowns - so you schedule your 23rd appointment with a shrink. you try to get a data crystal reader for your computer. you build a panel of crystals like the ones on the whitestars, and you
 use it as your keyboard. getting new glasses, you refuse to let them measure your head with that

 attempt to make him the CPU - but he gets out of control, so you put him

 foreign languages in order to warn everyone about the Shadows. you download pictures from the Hubble telescope and search them, looking
 for shadow ships. you try to write a political speech and realize that every other line is
 from B5. you can quote more B5 than Shakespeare... and you&apos;re a theater major. you write a computer program to randomly spit out combinations of 14
 words, in hopes of coming up with &quot;that&quot; 14. you play Magic: The Gathering, and everytime you attack with your
 creatures you say: &quot;We live for the ONE, we die for the ONE!&quot;. you hate to play Black in Magic: The Gathering because some creatures
 have &quot;SHADOW&quot; as an ability. someone offers peanuts to you, and you can&apos;t think of anything but

 you prepare dinner, for you fear someone will arrive with an
 assassination warning. you wonder where they got the Zarg that Arnie killed in Predator . after hearing a friend say something smart, you compliment him by saying

 especially from Lochley. the news ticker on MSN starts off &quot;Clarke poi...&quot; and you think President

 over...&quot; and you panic! Then you discover it&apos;s UK politics, and lose
 interest. you get a sailing boat and follow the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi wherever it goes. the name of the progressive rock band Spock&apos;s Beard doesn&apos;t

 would still try to cheat. you petition the government to chisel cities out of the Grand Canyon, but
 lament the fact the cities would not be crystalline. when people ask questions you don&apos;t want to answer, you start to chant
 &quot;Cee toh ree cho mon toh ray&quot; over and over again. you&apos;re a follower of Byron, even though you&apos;re a mundane. you are actually waiting for the Day of the Dead in 2062. you have an &quot;Army of Light&quot; uniform. you try to order zerka fabric. you keep calling your driver&apos;s license your identicard. you only buy gas at Sinclair stations, in the hope that it will transport
 you 1000 years into the past. while watching Grease , you wonder what Zack is doing as an
 undercover cop. when watching Secrets of the Soul you see yourself, not
 Lyta, in the Vorlon test tube. you believe that the future is always born in pain.
And you really know it when:
 you worship JMS.

If you want to add an entry, mail it to my address www@farah.cl .

This is the the original post in rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 . You may also find
it at Google Groups .

If you have a slow connection, and getting this list takes forever, then I
suggest you download the ykybwbtmw.zip instead:
it contains this HTML file and will take about a third of the time.

As of 1996/jun/02, this list has become more than 10 times larger than the
original one (350+ entries against only 35 in the original post in
1995/mar/10). I&apos;d like to thank all of the contributors, for having the will
of sending me their ideas (and also thanks to all of you who have had your
entries rejected - keep trying).

 THIS IS GREAT! As of 1997/feb/02, the list has become
more than 20 times larger! There are now 700+ entries. This sure means
Babylon 5 is becoming a classic.

 BIG CONGRATULATIONS go to Joanne Allan, who made the
1000th entry on 1997/aug/21!

 BIGGER CONGRATULATIONS go to Christopher McColm, who made
the 1400th entry on 1999/apr/13! This list has become FORTY times larger than
its original incarnation... impressive, isn&apos;t it?

 
A big THANK YOU goes
to James Wolf, who was kind enough to send me a videotape with the S4 final 4
episodes, when I needed it most.

Another THANK YOU for James, who sent me a second tape with In The Beginning .

An even greater THANK
YOU goes to Rain Lynham, who taped and sent me all of season
5.

 
Note: I get this asked a lot, so I&apos;ve decided to put the answer here: the
entry submitted by JMS was the one about &quot;Morden Utilities for people&quot; (but,
to be honest, he didn&apos;t send it to me - he posted it in rastb5, then I asked
him permission to include it here, and he granted it).

 
 This page was awarded as Best of Babylonia in 1997/jan/5 (too bad that WWW site
died).

 
If you can&apos;t get enough of this, look also at the You Know You&apos;ve Been Watching Crusade Too Much
When... list.

And be sure to read The Babylon 5 Bogus Episode
List that I also keep.
