Shore Dining, Part 2: Classics Craig LaBan is thankful for the Jersey Shore classics - both revived and still thriving - but is disappointed by newer high-end options. A stroke of snack-food genius V For Veg: Olympic rowers will officially be powered by a vegan product. Recipes with a legacy Heirloom restaurant recently hosted its first Heirloom Fine American Cookery recipe contest. The competition was inspired by heirloom recipes that channel a food and love connection. Single challenge: Cooking for one It can be a lonely challenge; it can also be a comforting, creative pastime. Here&apos;s advice from those who go solo. Wet and wild summer cocktail trends Carbonated cocktails in a bottle, punch bowls for sharing, and updated tiki drinks are the new pours this summer, as the cocktail scene in local restaurants and bars continues to keep pace with the city’s food revolution. Craig LaBan&apos;s online chat Here is an excerpt from Craig LaBan&apos;s online chat: Craig LaBan: Just got a chance to visit the barely year-old Dad&apos;s Hat Distillery in Bristol (see this coming Sunday&apos;s Drink column) which just launched its barrel-aged rye in the Pennsylvania market (along with its already available white rye). If you&apos;re really curious, Dad&apos;s distillery is inaugurating its open-to-the-public Saturdays this weekend with tours, tastings, and on-site sales thanks to the smart new Pennsylvania law allowing for on-site sales at craft distilleries, similar to wineries and breweries.   Gallery: La Petite Dauphine, in photos My Daughter&apos;s Kitchen: Vietnamese-Style Rice Noodle Salad Here is an excerpt from the blog &quot;My Daughter&apos;s Kitchen.&quot; From the time my children were in grade school, their favorite takeout dinner, hands down, was the vermicelli noodles and chicken topped with spring rolls from Vietnam Restaurant in Chinatown. I don&apos;t mean to suggest that they were super adventurous eaters, because they weren&apos;t. But my husband used to bring home this dinner for the two of us, and soon enough the kids wanted to taste what their parents were eating. Shortly thereafter, they wanted Styrofoam containers of their own.   Agave with your coffee? Finally...a way to enjoy agave without the hangover. That&apos;s right, agave nectar is made from the same plant used to produce tequila.

Parc (227 S. 18th St., 215-545-2262) opened on July 14, 2008. The French bistro celebrates its 4th birthday and Bastille Day this weekend with special dishes and drinks, and an accordion player. Eastern State Penitentiary (2027 Fairmount Ave., 215-236-5111, easternstate.org) celebrates Bastille Day with the experimental cabaret troupe the Bearded Ladies, starting at 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Things come to a, er, head as Marie Antoinette (a/k/a Terry McNally, co-owner of London Grill and Paris Wine Bar) is carried off, but not before throwing 3,000 Tastykakes to the rabble. Taco Bell upscales with Cantina line Chain: Taco Bell.Company description: This burrito is part of Taco Bell&apos;s new Cantina line, which the company describes thusly: &quot;Chef Lorena Garcia created Taco Bell&apos;s new Cantina Bell Menu by using bold and flavorful ingredients, including guacamole, citrus-herb marinated chicken, and freshly prepared pico de gallo.&quot; Nutritional info: 760 calories, 27 grams of fat, 1,960 mg of sodium.   Gallery: Seafood Unlimited&apos;s new mosaic Recipe: Agave-Barbecue Roasted Chicken 3- to 5-pound whole chickenKosher salt and ground black pepper For the barbecue sauce: NoBL brings Mediterranean flavor to Lansdowne Table Talk: Early crowds are finding ambition in Lansdowne at the gorgeous NoBL, a Mediterranean BYOB that opened last week.

Two cool popsicle recipes Here are two cool and delicious popsicle recipes you can try at home from Jeanne Chang at Lil Pop Shop in West Philly.

Here’s some advice on where to place your bets. Cheap Buzz: Gin drinking&apos;s easy in the summertime BUZZ: It&apos;s summertime again, so everybody&apos;s drinking gin-and-tonics. Ugh. Why anybody would drink something that smells like Pine-Sol is beyond me. Makes me queasy just thinking about it. Marnie: Believe it or not, Buzz, modern gin traces its roots to a 17th-century Dutch remedy for upset stomachs, among other ailments. Alcoholic tinctures of botanical ingredients were common medicines. Juniper berries were thought to help kidney problems, gallstones and the gout, too. Great beer is a state of mind Joe Sixpack: On &quot;island time&quot; a cold bottle of Heineken is the best beer in the world. Pork&amp;beans, always a cute couple But they play the field a lot, too, getting into sassy or sweet sauces, or even a salad. This pair was made to be fiddled with. Scallops With Thai-Scented Pea Puree Let&apos;s face it, sometimes dinner comes down to what&apos;s in the freezer. With a bag of Trader Joe&apos;s scallop, a bag of frozen peas and 20 minutes, you have a fabulous, easy dinner. Hot diggity: Philly&apos;s best dogs The once-humble hot dog is on a roll. Here&apos;s a guide to some of the top dogs, old-school and upscale. Mini-meals done organic Family-loving Food Network chef Tyler Florence has rolled out a line of organic, easy-to-prepare, yummy packaged food for the wee set (from babes to toddlers) called Sprout. Eats Beat: 5/7/12 Eats Beat: All things blueberry will be honored at the Blueberry Bash summer festival at Terhune Orchards. Culinary gift from a great grandmom Elizabeth Gilbert found a treasure in her great-gran&apos;s recipe book. Written in 1947 by Margaret Yardley Potter, a well-heeled socialite raised in refined Chestnut Hill, the book offers recipes folded into tart pose. Build uncommonly fine burgers Fresh grinding, blending of prime cuts yield today&apos;s perfect, pricey patties.
