We like Chipotle and have enjoyed them in several cities, including this one in Colorado Springs. The servings are generously sized. Each person in our family can get things that taste the way they want them to. And it&apos;s a great value for freshly made food with fresh ingredients. And the guacamole - the best!

Quick and tasty. Easy menu at a fair price - I eat here as often as I can. Good food - healthy alternative to traditional food.

Well here is for your confidence. Chipotle is rated the healthiest fast food restaurant in the world. Then in Colorado (since it originated here) we get the honor of having all natural ingredients...most of which come from here in Colorado. I just get a burrito with everything on it and devour it. The downside is that no more student drink... More

Chipotle is a favorite spot for everyone in my family and for good reason. The burritos are amazingly delicious and will not leave you hungry. You get to customize your meal as they make each order fresh and in front of you; everyone gets to have their food exactly as they desire. Chipotle pride themselves in serving good food from... More
