 Feeding extended family for a year I posted this on another forum and wanted to share with you as well. This is what I have learned from our experience over the past year.

How we fed 10 and sometimes 16 for a year.

Background:
Many of you have read my other threads where I shared that we have fed my daughter, SIL, grandkids and my parents for a year. That is 10 people. We also garden with the older daughter and her family of six. The younger daughter and family are moving out Friday after saving every penny and finally being able to buy a house after his job loss. SIL has worked two jobs and daughter has helped with our small farm.

Here is what I have learned for future difficult situations and wanted to share:
1. We have stored large quantities of food for years and canned most of our meats, vegetables and fruits that we raise ourselves and scrounge from sales, etc. That helped a lot with the learning curve. We store what we eat and eat what we store.
2. We always thought we had enough of everything stored for a year for all of us. We did not.
3. We used the usual LDS tables, etc. to calculate food storage and prepare for a disaster. I also had my own tables of what we eat and how much we needed. My own tables were a life saver. You must know what you eat and store plenty of it. See below for where I messed up.
4. The economy and having to buy food at increasing prices really took a cut into our budget.

Results of a year:
1. We used 200+ pounds more wheat than we had planned or thought we would need. That comes to around 600 pounds of wheat, maybe more because I did not count the wheat we bought from a local feed store. My record keeping must improve.
2. Extensions of rice, beans and noodles are absolutely essential to stop the budget buster. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to store beans, rice and noodles and LEARN to COOK them in hundreds of different ways. Having to work on this for variety took way too much time. Now, however, we are better equipped and have a notebook of recipes to help us. Everything from Pinto Bean soup from a fellow squirrel to Louisiana Hot Beans. Beans take practice. You must remember to soak them the night before to avoid the usual issues with beans. When we forgot, then we had to come up with something else to fix. Rice became the fall back. I&apos;m beginning to hate rice.
3. Buy an extra Crock Pot. We kept two going most weeks just to keep up. There is just not enough room on the stove to can as much as we needed to and cook meals at the same time.
4. Learn to make simple breads. I had a colon tumor several years ago and grinding my wheat has been a part of my life for years. I had no idea what to do, however, when children could not handle the wheat. We learned to soak the grains and sprout the wheat. It was a learning curve, however, that wasted precious time....... We are either soaking or sprouting most of the time. My main source for this was the book Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon.
5. Counter space in the kitchen. This seems stupid to most of you, but when you are cooking for so many and canning at the same time.....this becomes essential and saves lots of broken dishes and insanity. We learned to have everything in zones and broke things down into small chunks. Everyone had a different job, but the same job all the time. DD was responsible for soaking grains....I dehydrated the sprouted grains....she made the specialty breads.....I kept the bread machine going. It has to be streamlined. I can only imagine how difficult this would become without electricity and no bread machine. I&apos;ve done it, but with this many people.......it would be tough.
6. Fruit.....we vastly underestimated here. I use it for granola and oatmeal and eating. We dried 4 bushels of apples and canned peaches and blueberries. We ran out of apples by the end of December. I had to buy fruit.....A BUDGET BUSTER!! We are buying twice as many apples when they are in season this year to split among us and have dehydrated and canned six bushels of peaches for the year. I have also done 3 bushels of blueberries and we are working on the melons now.
7. Vegetables....You cannot have enough tomatoes. (I know this is technically a fruit.) We underestimated on pizza sauce and over estimated on tomato soups. I did not save enough for vegetable soups during the year. It takes a lot of planning to get this right. I should have thought it through better. I wound up having to either buy picante sauce or make my own after January or so when the salsa ran out. Green things.....broccoli wasted precious freezer space and needs to be dehydrated instead, green beans get old every meal, lettuce bolts when you have a really hot April.
8. Herbs.....I could not believe how much basil and oregano we went through. This was an area I had only guessed at how much we would need. This was a major shock! I used almost all of my cinnamon reserves and we ran out of garlic and thyme. I purchased a huge supply of dehydrated onions and separated it into jars. I have some left, but we need a very large amount. We use garlic for everything and lots in medicinal treatments. I planted three times as much garlic this past year and have some in the dehydrator now for garlic powder. We have gone through everything I had and have bought more during the year.
9. Medicinal herbs.....you need a lot for kids.....more than I had stored. Thyme was an issue as was the garlic as already mentioned. We used a lot more chamomile than I thought we would.
10. Meats. With so many people, we could never fix them plain. They were always fixed with an extender. We went through the meals I had canned very quickly. There were many days where we were exhausted from canning, taking care of children and dealing with my father with dementia. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to have an extended difficult period without having instant meals to fall back on. After this year, I plan to have half a cow canned in various ways on my shelves just to reach for when things are impossible. Given the cost of everything, we just could not run to the local fast food restaurant when we were too tired to cook. Being able to heat stews, soups and roasts to serve over rice and noodles was a life saver for me.
11. Medicines, etc...I overestimated on bandaids, underestimated on poison ivy fighting supplies and have been working on the jewel weed soap and salve when time permits. We had plenty of headache type products, but need tons more lotion. I had no idea how much we would need with all of us doing manual labor. Pain medication and those wonderful stick on pads for sore muscles.......I now buy those most every time they are on-sale.
12. Paper products. You can live without paper towels. It sure saves a lot of money, but it means you must wash more often. We did a mix of both. Some days paper towels were the greatest thing ever for wiping up spilled milk etc. Other days we had time for the towels and washing. When kids are sick, forget trying to use towels and wash.
13. Soap. I had exactly enough stored for a year. I usually make my own, but that was tough in the middle of everything. I have made some for fun in the last several months, but I made enough again to last for awhile. Dishwashing liquid and washing machine powders.......this was terrible. I was a total failure in storage here. This is an area that I need to stock LOTS more. I thought I was doing great but forgot how many times that kids have to change clothes and diapers need to be washed.

How to stay sane:
1. Clutter will be everywhere with that many people in a house. Get used to it and ignore the toys.
2. You can never have enough storage bins. Buy more.
3. De-clutter closets and organize the long term storage. I thought I was organized, but not enough. When the power fails and you have this many people in one house, stumbling for blankets and having to move food buckets is the pits!
4. Glasses. Buy lots of extra at yard sales or use the plastic throw away type and re-wash them for the long haul. We tried to keep up with everyone&apos;s cup to avoid washing, but that is really a job.
5. Keep the refrigerator free of left overs. Feed them to the chickens instead and keep things rotated well. We needed so much space just for produce as it came in from the garden. Some things ruined because there were just not enough hours in the day to can them.
6. We built a pea sheller. Time involved in shelling peas just was not worth it for us. Time was the real problem. There just is not enough time to keep cooking and working from scratch without cutting steps to the bare minimum.
7. Have a universal calendar for everyone. At no time should everyone have their own calendars when this many people are together. Everything went on my phone and my phone stayed in my pocket at all times. The alarms went off to check chick feed, broiler water, plant seeds, water the garden, turn off the water, check the canner, check the dehydrator. Alarms went off constantly, but there was no other way to keep up with everything.
8. God. What do people do without Him? This should really have been number one. Yes, my personal quiet time suffered, yes, my Bible study has been pitiful and sporadic, but I would not trade this year for anything. I have seen God at work in my life, my kid&apos;s lives, my grandkids lives in ways that will always be a blessing to me. I am so thankful. When peace returns next week and the kids move out, there will be time for my personal study and my personal Quiet Time....the last year has been a wonderful teaching opportunity for my grandchildren. We have sung praise songs together and read Bible stories together when I should have been canning and doing other things, but the dividends from our time together will pay back for years to come. There is always a blessing in the middle of a storm. You just have to trust God and wait for Him to show it to you.

 Wow I got tired just reading about all you did.

You could make microwavable heating pads to use instead of the stick on ones...it is a great way to use some of that rice.

 Wow again!
Thank you for posting.

So the children couldn&apos;t digest the whole wheat breads? What were their symptoms and how did you find out that wheat was the culprit?

So you sprouted then dehydrated the wheat?
Then ground the dehydrated grains to make flour that the kids could digest?

I haven&apos;t read the book you referred to, but this is the first time I&apos;ve heard about sprouted being less allergenic/easier to digest.

I will be rereading your post until it all sinks in.

I do have a lot of beans, rice and noodles in storage...
I cook a lot of traditional Mexican and I&apos;m learning Indian recipes. It&apos;s hard to try new cuisines when I don&apos;t know what a recipe will turn out like, I hate to waste food.

Do you have some suggestions regarding what most folks in your family really like?
I mean something different that surprised you when they all liked it? (We already do stir-frys over rice, and almost anything/everything over pasta or potatoes.&lt;-- all popular meals, but still get old after a while)

example: lentils are plentiful but not popular around here, I&apos;m going to try lots more veggies or more curry powder (or both) next time. If that doesn&apos;t work, I&apos;m going to cook then puree them, and use them for thickeners in soups, casseroles and stews until I use them up.

Again, thanks for sharing!

 We discovered wheat was the problem by process of elimination. Yes we sprouted and then dehydrated.

 Sorry Nature Lover, I got interrupted and did not answer the rest of your post.

Yes, we discovered that even though this was my daughter, she had been out of the house for 10 years. Her eating habits had changed. They love Thai and Curried foods. We had never really fixed those. Our eating was enriched by the blending of the various ways we cooked.

Mexican, Italian, Stir-fries, bean meals, Thai and Indian foods became ways to stretch the budget and make the same types of foods interesting. Often we had almost the same meals, but with different spices it was totally different. Chicken curried one night can be changed the next time the recipe is fixed to Thai by adding the chili peppers and coconut milk. The same is true with beans and lentils.

We love homemade pizzas, various types of meat over noodles or rice, bean soups with lots of spices and our favorite is Mexican. That comes from living 10 years in Texas. We make our own tortillas as well. I have to buy the mesa flour, but it is worth it to us.

Breakfast consisted of eggs, sausage, homemade bread or soaked oatmeal or soaked and dehydrated granola. Again, it was the grain issue for the kids so we had to soak the oatmeal in whey or yogurt to help&quot;pre-digest&quot;some of the grains.

 Great post! What did you do for beverages? Did you buy milk or use dry? How about coffee/tea - had you stored enough?

 we used to use the wide mouth pints for glasses , but we decided to use the wide mouth pints for canning , and now use the natural penut butter jars for glasses , if one breaks it is no big deal , heck even if they get junked up bad and i don&apos;t feel like scrubbing at it i just recycle it we use a jar or two of peanut butter every week so new glasses are always comming.

very good to hear your accounts of things , i can imagine how tiring it was , i feel like there isn&apos;t enought time in the day to work and keep up with the garden, chickens, projects and other responcabilities.

 Milk. We have a source for that, but yes I buy it. I give some of it to the chickens. I also store some powdered. Tea... I buy that with coupons and had a lot stored but did buy more as I normally would. We grow chamomile but I had to supplement. Coffee. We had to buy lots. I only store for myself but SIL drinks lots.

 This was a great post. I know if things really get bad I&apos;ll have 8 more people here and I keep that in the back of my mind when I&apos;m preparing. Have been trying a different ethnic recipe a week--new favorites are curries. Yum. I think I could deal with the cooking but the chaos is another after it just being me and DH for last 7 years. Thinking finding ways for everyone to have some private space will be important as two married couples and all kids over 18 but one. DEE who highly recommends the book Nourishing Traditions as a person who cannot tolerate straight wheat either.

 Your story is so inspirational!

I, for one, would love a list of your recipes. I know there are lots of&quot;storage&quot;cook books out there but they never really seem to fit with the average person whose not in a shtf but rather a personal change.

Also, I would love to know the size of your garden, your layout, who and how it was worked and some of your numbers in planting and harvesting as well as fertilizing and pest control. VERY interested. Diagram maybe? It would give a much more realistic and current look at gardening for a family&apos;s food.

Great post. Hope you&apos;ll take topics as individual items and more fully address them. It would be such a wonderful way to help others.

 I really enjoyed your post, and it brought to mind several thing&apos;s that I had not thought of. If the same thing happened to us we would have 4 and possibly 6 extra people, so I need to refigure quite a few more things.

 I&apos;ve always considered feeding extended family as a simple mathematical equation:

If X pounds of beans will last 6 people for 12 months, that same X pounds will last 12 people only 6 months.

However your post sort of reveals some flaws in my thinking. I&apos;ll walk through the bullet points:

-I have a shortage of diversity in my food preps. Most of my planned supplements come from meat, eggs, and both wild and domesticated plants. That would become a problem if I had to take on a large number of people.

-There are those in my extended family who would be more susceptible to events because they don&apos;t prep and also make poor life choices. They also shun&quot;real food&quot;and certainly&quot;real work&quot;. I have no idea how I would motivate them to pick up the load as you seem to have been able to do with your family. Or perhaps your SIL and her family simply suffered from bad luck and were really the type of people who were going to work hard to pick up the slack.

-Space is going to be an issue. 1300 square feet is barely enough for my own 6 person family. I don&apos;t know where I&apos;d put more people unless we built something additional. Also, I really need a lot of solitude for my peace of mind.

Again, a very admirable situation and thank you for posting it. It&apos;s left me with a lot of thinking to do and (hopefully) at the end some action to take.

 ERNIE, the space thing , we have a LOT of campers poping up in front , back and side yards all around town i have seen more than one household consolidated into a horse trailer with camper front , and several for sale as even horse people are going broke and selling. lots of fammiles moving in together , has to be as there is an empty house every third block now it seems with a house for sale or rent on every other block depends some on neighbor hood but there are a lot.

when space gets worth more you start to see people convert garages to appartments
and such

 Family or not, if someone refuses to pull their part of the load, they will be asked to leave. In a shtf situation there is no room for deadbeats. You want to eat potatoes then you WILL dig the garden, you WILL plant potatoes, you WILL hoe potatoes and you WILL dig potatoes. (And possibly peal, cook and mash them as well!)

I started a cookbook shortly after I started my food storage of recipes to use storage items. I&apos;m always watching magazines for recipes that can be adapted to storage foods. I agree 100% with using meat in casseroles or other ways where it is not the main dish. A pint of canned pork, chicken or beef can be stretched to feed a large group and it will taste great. As my family grew I did not put more meat into chili, I added more beans!

 A two car garage can easily be split into 2 or more bedrooms. Stud walls go up fast. At one time my mother, 2 sisters and a niece moved in with me. I had a 3 bd/2 bath rental and I put a couple of stud walls up in the garage. I covered one side with paneling. The side towards the laundry area I left uncovered, but put up a lot of heavy shelving. I covered the garage doors from the inside. All this was easily taken down, but my landlord was totally delighted to have two extra bedrooms and didn&apos;t want it removed.

 Wow, thanks for this post. I love the book Nourishing traditions and probably need to get my own copy as I keep checking out the one in the library.

Have you tried the bread made with yogurt in that book? I use it due to yeast problems in the family (although I use kefir instead of yogurt), and it is a little moister than most breads, but I thought one of the advantages was that it is supposed to be a little more digestible since the dough soaks for quite a while before baking.

On your herbs, were most of them home grown? I have found that I have to use less of home grown herbs since they seem to be much stronger (and fresher) than what is available in the stores. Especially for oregano, basil and rosemary.

 Thanks so much for the info! Lots of good info. It is one thing to try and plan things but to put it into action is entirely different. We have to be entirely gluten free here due to Celiac&apos;s so it puts a crimp in everything. I know I need to stock more rice and work on cooking more beans.
