July 4 Cocktail Plea: Give Me LiberTea or Give Me the Recipe

​ All sorts of recipes seem to come our way, including lots of cocktail ideas. Concerning the latter, we try to pass on only those that are distinctive in some way, or at the very least those that offer sparkling refreshment for Miami heat. The LiberTea, a Fourth of July marketing moniker cooked up by the Wild Turkey Bourbon folks, comes through in both respects. Lemonade and basil practically shout summer ; the tea, Wild Turkey, and honey liqueur add comfort and two kicks. We also like that this is the type of cocktail that can be prepared by the pitcher, in advance, which lessens the host&apos;s bartending duties.
 
 The LiberTea
 
 Ingredients (makes 1 pitcher):
 
4 cups water
4 cups lemonade
4 black tea bags
1 cup fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup Wild Turkey Bourbon
1 1/2 cups American Honey (honey liqueur from Wild Turkey)

 Preparation: 
In a large saucepan, boil 2 cups water. Remove from heat; add 4 tea bags of black tea. Steep 8 minutes; discard teabags. Add 2 cups cold water and lemonade; transfer to pitcher and chill. Add fresh basil leaves. Using a wooden spoon, crush basil until fragrant. Stir in Wild Turkey Bourbon and American Honey. Serve over ice.

 Alternative preparation for lazy hosts: 
Fill pitcher with ice-cold beer instead.
