 At a restaurant something different, fast food the same. When at the fast food joint I order off the dollar menu and it is for my dogs. They love to go to the&quot;hole in the wall,&quot;2 double cheese burgers no ketchup no mustard and small vanilla shake to wash it down.

I appreciate that. I knew she was trying to start an argument and that is why I didnt&apos;keep it going and let it drop. I read the post again today but I am NOT going to argue with her about my beliefs. She said she didn&apos;t want to argue but I knew better. Thank you for standing up for me.. she would have kept on and on until she got the last word. (and it won&apos;t be her last word..she will keep adding things to her last words, you wait and see). I am pretty wise with knowing things like that. I wasn&apos;t being racist, I was stating what I do believe is true. people like that will argue with a wall. again thank you

 We don&apos;t often eat at fast food, just when we are in the city on Sunday for church (and our church isn&apos;t having a Chinese food sale, to raise money for missions, which is quite often! yum!) Then I go to Maccas and have a Cheeseburger Happy meal, because it&apos;s small and it has a toy which I take to Bali with me when I visit orphanages.

 Depends on my mood and the restaurant.

I generally like to try new things all the time, if the option exists. This is how I find new favorites.

 I don&apos;t get something different every time, I tend to stick with something I have had at that particular restaurant before. I&apos;m a creature of habit when it comes to food though I don&apos;t limit myself to only having one or two items.

For instance: Perkins, either the spaghetti, the turkey bacon club with a salad, or an omlette.

 I like to have a number of things that I would choose to get....you know, so I at least don&apos;t have to order the exact same meal every time. Having at least two preferred meal choices is good enough, so I can switch between them.

 It really depends on the restaurant. Some places only have one or two vegetarian dishes, so I don&apos;t have many options. If there are several options, I will get something different.

 I WORK in a fast food restaurant so I might be different then others but I have tried nearly everthing on the A&amp;W menuboard but have stuck by my Mama burger, extra seasoning, just mayo and ketchup. Ooh, and fries with vinegar and tons of salt.

 I don&apos;t usually go to fast food joints, that would probably be a case of same thing each time. In a restaurant, I like to try different items on the menu each time I go. If something is really good, I will order it again whenever the mood strikes me.

 There are some much beloved places I will order the same thing each time, in fact we go there just to order that one dish. And then there are the exciting places where I will always try something new and love making discoveries and getting ideas for my own home cooking. Fast food I don&apos;t do often. Not much choice either.

 I do not visit fast food joints of any sort as the food tends to disagree with me and I pay almost as much as I would for a good meal at a restaurant. Generally I like to try different things particularly at a place that is new to me, though places I frequent I do tend to have my favorites.

 i am unpredictable. certain places such as Cracker Barrel, I always have the grilled catfish and the apple dumpling but my sides always vary.

if something is really good, i will order it again. there is really no telling what i will order certain times and even i surprise myself.
