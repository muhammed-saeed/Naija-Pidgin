EDIT: Per suggestion, I&apos;ve added a version with more subtle team logos.       I&apos;m not amazing at cropping to proper widths for average users because I use my TV as a monitor @ 1920 x 1080. I did make it smaller, so hopefully it looks ok and doesn&apos;t take up the whole screen in the preview. Let me know what you think. Thanks!  EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback. I did another, just in case those of you who like variety haven&apos;t gotten your fix anywhere else.       Aaaannnnddd mobile:       EDIT III: Ok, the high res are up thanks to imageshack who, it seems, is the only major image-hosting service that doesn&apos;t down-size your high-res photos. Anyway, enjoy!

J. Doh, E. J. Lee, M. Y. Ko, B. S. Oh, S. E.   2010-01-01    One of the medicinal materials produced by plants belonging to the genus Scrophularia, âScrophularia Radixâ (SR), has been prescribed for many centuries to treat diseases such as inflammation, abscesses of carbuncles and constipation. In China, the dried root of S. ningoensis Hemsley is the source of SR. In contrast, the root of S. buergeriana is generally prescribed as SR in Korea. Studies conducted to identify the bioactive compounds in these two Scrophularia plants have revealed marked differences in the contents and concentration of the compounds they contain. However, S. ningpoensis has been indiscriminately prescribed in Korea along with S. buergeriana as SR. Furthermore, S. koraiensis has long been used in lieu of S. buergeriana as SR in Korea. Therefore, a standard or method to...

Lord, J. B.   2010-01-01    Ribosomal genes and their spacer s have been extensively utilized to examine the biodiversity and phylogenetics of protists. Among these, the internal  transcribed  spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) are known to form secondary structures that are critically important for proper processing of the pre-rRNA into mature ribosomes. Although the secondary structure of ITS2 has been widely investigated, considerably less is known about ITS1 and its secondary structure. Here, secondary structures of the ITS1 were modeled for 46 ITS“types”from Symbiodinium, a diverse dinoflagellate genus that forms symbioses with many protists and metazoans, using comparative phylogenetic and minimum free energy approaches.

P.   1984-01-01    There are about 20,000-30,000 unique structural genes in a typical fungal organism like Neurospora or yeast. An analysis of fungal chromosomal rRNA gene repeat units (rDNA) suggests that they have the typical 5 x 8S, 16-18S, and 26-28S conserved sequences. In addition, these rRNA gene clusters contain Internal  Transcribed  Spacer (ITS) regions of 500-1000 nucleotide base pair (bp) size, which also contain the 5.8S rRNA gene. Thus, one transcribed repeat unit of rDNA containing the rRNA genes is approximately 6 kilobase pair (kb) in some fungal species. In yeast, an additional 5S rRNA gene is included in the 6 kb repeat unit. In many fungi, rRNA genes exist in multiple copies of 100-450. Each of the repeat units of rRNA genes is separated from each other by External Transcribed  Spacer (ETS) and a stretch of External Non- transcribed  Spacer (ENTS) region of 2-5 kb sizes. These ITS, ETS or ENTS regions are variable regions which may provide species specific characteristics for fungal taxonomy. Nuclesomal structures of rDNAs also conform to other chromosomal genes. Extrachromosomal rRNA genes of Physarum or Tetrahymena are organized as 5..--&gt;..3ES 3..--&gt;..5(pallindromes). Ribosomal RNA genes are also located within mitochondrial genomes of fungal species, as single copies comprising mostly 16S and 26S rRNA genes which are separated from each other by long stretches of DNA sequences of 1-5 kb size.

Anopheles kochi is reported for the Ist time from New Guinea, probably introduced by aircraft. This Oriental species was originally detected by analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified rDNA internal  transcribed  spacer unit 2 (ITS-2). identification was confirmed by morphologic examination. Size of ITS-2 is presented for 32 species of Australasian and Oriental anophelines to assist morphologic identifications for distribution and vector studies.

A.; Glasgow, H. B.; Burkholder, J. M.; Oldach, D.W. E-mail: oldach@umbi.umd.edu   2003-01-01    Complete small subunit ribosomal RNA, internal  transcribed  spacer 1 and 2, 5.8S, and partial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences were generated from multiple isolates of Pfiesteria piscicida. Sequences were derived from isolates that have been shown to be ichthyotoxic as well as isolates that have no history of toxic behavior. All of the sequences generated were identical for the different cultures, and we therefore conclude that differences in toxicity seen between isolates of P. piscicida are linked to factors other than genetic strain variation detectable by ribosomal gene sequence analyses     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)       19    http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/42840    Clements, Mark A.; Mackenzie, Anne M.; Copson, Geof R.; Molloy, Brian P.; Carmichael, Noel; Skotnicki, Mary L.       A second orchid species, Nematoceras sulcatum M.A.Clem. et D.L.Jones, has been found on subantarctic Macquarie Island. A history of its discovery and recognition is provided. The morphology, biology and ecology of the new species are compared with N. dienemum (D.L.Jones) D.L.Jones, M.A.Clem. et Molloy, the other species of orchid on Macquarie Island. Molecular studies based on the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA reveal the phylogenetic relationship of the two Macquarie Island species compared to others in the genus from New Zealand and its Southern Ocean islands.11 page(s)                                     Publisher: Springer                                                     Contributor: Macquarie University.

C.   2007-01-01    Out of 106 Trypanosomal DNAs from infected domestic animals, 77 (72.6%) were resolved into different Trypanosome species using primers based on ribosomal internal  transcribed  spacer -1 region in a single PCR (ITS-PCR). The remaining 29 (27.4%) Trypanosomal DNA samples were negative by ITS-PCR, but were positive by TBR-PCR, indicating that they were Trypanozoon Trypanosomes where the ITS-PCR could not resolve their identities. This was possibly due to the low amounts of DNA in the extracts which could not be picked up by ITS-PCR. The TBR-PCR was able to resolve all 106 Trypanosome isolates into 88 Trypanozoon and 18 others, which were identified and confirmed as T.congolense (6) and T.vivax (12) Trypanosomes. In addition, a total of 58 (89.2%) of the 65 (53 from cows and 12 from pigs) Trypanosome isolates from domestic animals in T.b.gambiense endemic areas in North West Uganda ... &gt;&gt;     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)         21    Molecular diagnosis of Trypanosome species    Viljoen, G.; Romito, J. M.   2007-01-01    Various parameters for handling samples, extracting nucleic acid and protocols for use of PCR to diagnose trypanosomes have been examined. The use of a commercial kit (Nucleon BACC 2, Amersham) was superior to other extraction methods. After comparisons, a touchdown thermocycling protocol was the procedure used. PCR testing protocols were successfully implemented using Kin primers that bind to an internal  transcribed  spacer region (ITS1) situated between the 18S and the 5.8S ribosomal subunit genes on nuclear DNA. Their sensitivity was lower than that of satellite DNA primers, particularly for T.vivax. A Kin primer-based PCR could detect and distinguish between a number of Trypanosome species in blood samples. The use of an ITS1 binding primer was 3-5 x cheaper than using classical species-specific primers since the number of PCR reactions per sample is reduced to one. ... &gt;&gt;     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)       22    Molecular markers for the different (sub)-species of the Trypanozoon subgenus    Claes, F.; Radwanska, M.; Buescher; Agbo, E.; Pas, F. W.   2007-01-01    Recently developed PCRs based on the internal  transcribed  spacer 1 (ITS-1) allow differentiation of the Trypanozoon subgenus, T.vivax and T.congolense based on differences in length of the amplification products. These assays also allow the detection of mixed infections by one single PCR assay. PCR assays for differentiating the different members of the Trypanozoon subgenus, however, remained a challenging issue. During the past years, species specific PCR&apos;s for identifying the different taxa within the Trypanozoon subgenus have been developed. For the detection of the two human pathogenic Trypanosomes, PCR-SRA for T.b.rhodesiense and PCR-TgsGP gene for T.b.gambiense were developed. For animal Trypanosomiasis, a T.evansi specific PCR based on the RoTat 1.2 VSG was developed. Only for T.b.brucei and T.equiperdum, no specific markers could be identified. However, ... &gt;&gt;     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)       23    rDNA-PCR assay for two members of the Anopheles culicifacies Complex    Manonmani, A. M.; Sahu, S. S.; Jambulingam, P.   2005-01-01    DNA probes based on the internal  transcribed  spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the ribosomal DNA were developed for the vector and non-vector species of the Anopheles culicifacies complex occurring in the southern part of India. Species specific differences encountered in the sequences of the ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA of An. culicifacies A and B were used as the basis for developing a species diagnostic PCR assay. Samples of An. culicifacies were collected from different villages of the Thenpennai riverine tract and Rameshwaram taluk of Tamilnadu state, southern India, where malaria is endemic. Adult specimens were collected from daytime resting places such as houses, cattle sheds, culverts and pit traps while larval stages were collected from riverine pools and from flowing water in the river of Thenpennai and irrigation systems in coconut groves and casuarina pits of ... &gt;&gt;     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)       24    Ribosomal RNA phylogenetics: the third dimension    Keller, A. Wolf, M. Dandekar, T.   2010-01-01    With integration of secondary structures, ribosomal genes have once again become very popular for phylogenetic analyses. This additional source of information to the nucleotide sequence provides a massive boost for taxonomic inferences. Herein, we propose that in the near future a further benefit for phylogenetics with such genes will be very likely by inclusion of the third dimension. For the first time, we determined the tertiary structure of the ribosomal internal  transcribed  spacer 2 for Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii by application of two different in silico prediction algorithms. We compared these methods with focus on phylogenetic usability. Further, we determined the tertiary structures for closely related green algae to provide a small phylogenetic example.

Lee, F. L.   2010-01-01    The objective of this study was to develop species-specific primer pairs based on the internal  transcribed  spacer region (ITS) of the ribosome DNA for species identification of the frequently found sourdough yeast species. Species-specific primers were designed by the alignment of sourdough yeast ITS sequences, which were then employed for PCR using the template DNA of sourdough yeast strains. PCR primers were shown to be specific for the following species: Issatchenkia orientalis (Candida krusei), C. humilis, Kazachstania exigua (C. holmii), Pichia anomala and P. subpelliculosa. Therefore, we conclude that our novel species-specific primers could be used to rapidly and accurately identify the most frequent sourdough yeast species using a PCR-based assay.

We identified Trypanozoon subgenus through a single PCR based on internal  transcribed  spacer 1 (ITS1) of rDNA. Trypanosoma evansi was identified in all isolates distributed in Thailand. Therefore, we analysed genetic diversity through a single PCR based on a repeated DNA coding sequence marker within T.evansi isolates from various animals. Fifty-four isolates of T.evansi originated from 6 species of hosts in 20 provinces of Thailand were compared according to the genetic patterns of this marker. The results revealed that T.evansi isolates had a high degree of heterozygosity at this locus related to the repeated coding sequence. Therefore, 4 group-specific genotypes, namely group 1 (3/5), group 2 (3/6), group 3 (4/5) and ... &gt;&gt;     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)       27    The use of ITS1 rDNA PCR in detecting pathogenic African Trypanosomes    Constantine, C. C.; Thompson, R. C.; Njiru, Z. K.; Kinyua, J. K.; Guya, S.; Kiragu, J. M.; Crowther, J. R.; Davila, A. M.   2007-01-01    There are 11 different pathogenic Trypanosomes in Trypanosomiasis endemic regions of Africa. Their detection and characterization by molecular methods relies on species-specific primers, consequently several PCR tests have to be made on each sample. Primers ITS1 CF and ITS1 BR, previously designed to amplify the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS1) of rDNA, have been evaluated for use in a universal diagnostic test for all pathogenic Trypanosomes. Blood was collected from 373 cattle and 185 camels. The primers gave constant PCR products with the stocks of each taxon tested. Members of subgenus Trypanozoon (T.brucei, T.evansi, T.b.rhodesiense and T.b.gambiense) gave a constant product of approximately 480 bp.

AMF were detected in 21 of 22 plant species analyzed. Mean mycorrhization levels reached up to 74.5% root length colonized. AMF diversity was analyzed based on 104 sequences of the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 6 species all belonging to the genus Glomus. There was no overlap between species detected as active mycorrhizas on roots (2 taxa) or as spores (4 taxa). Compared to the regional context, the diversity of AMF at our field site was reduced, which may reflect a residual disturbance effect.

Dengue outbreaks occur regularly in parts of northern Queensland, Australia, and there is Concern that these outbreaks may spread with the introduction and range expansion of the two main vectors Aedcs aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse). Problems encountered in separating larvae of endemic and exotic container mosquito species resulted in the development of a polymerase chain reaction diagnostic procedure that uses a restriction enzyme to cut the internal  transcribed  spacer region 1 of the ribosomal DNA to separate Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from a number of common local container mosquito species which can be used at any stage of the life cycle, including eggs up to 8 wk of age. Identification was possible using desiccated or alcohol-preserved specimens with a response time of&lt;24 h after receipt of the specimens.

Lindner, L. Marschall, K. Dalla Via, J.   2010-01-01    White haze (WH), a manifestation of extensive colonization of anamorphic smut fungi of the genus Tilletiopsis on the surface of apple fruit, has recently been described as a new postharvest disorder of the cultivar Elstar. This study shows that these fungi can also affect apple fruit of different cultivars prior to harvest, and therefore seriously compromise the quality of the produce in Northern Italy. In order to identify the Tilletiopsis taxa involved in the induction of WH in this region, 48 isolates, mainly derived from fruit samples, were analysed by DNA sequencing of the internal  transcribed  spacer region. Six haplotypes were identified that could be assigned to three different phylogenetic lineages, the T. washingtonensis group, the T. pallescens group and the Entylomataceae. More ...

W.   2008-01-01    To monitor genetic diversity and environmental contamination in eastern Australia, toxicity studies have employed the sensitive benthic amphipod Melita plumulosa. The goal of this study was to examine the genetic and life-history variability of natural populations of M. plumulosa from the Parramatta (polluted) and Hawkesbury (unpolluted) Rivers. The underlying genetics of the populations in these distinct waterways was examined at one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)) and one nuclear (ribosomal internal  transcribed  spacer region 1 (ITS1)) locus. Seven unique haplotypes for COI were found amongst animals from the Parramatta River, while animals from the Hawkesbury River showed a complete absence of genetic variation at this locus. At ITS1 a total of two sequence variants were found amongst Parramatta River amphipods and three sequence variants ... &gt;&gt;     International Nuclear Information System (INIS)       32    A real-time (TaqMan) PCR assay to differentiate Monilinia fructicola from other brown rot fungi of fruit crops    van Brouwershaven, I.

F.   2010-01-01    To prevent the entry and spread of the brown rot fungus Monilinia fructicola in Europe, a fast and reliable method for detection of this organism is essential. In this study, an automated DNA extraction method combined with a multiplex real-time PCR based on TaqMan chemistry was developed for fast, convenient and reliable detection of both the EU quarantine organism Monilinia fructicola and the three other brown rot fungi M. fructigena, M. laxa and Monilia polystroma. Using the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene repeat, a Monilinia genus-specific primer pair and two differently labelled fluorogenic probes specific for M. fructicola and the group M. fructigena/M. laxa/Monilia polystroma were developed.

An investigation of the microbial composition of 21 artisan sourdoughs from 11 different Belgian bakeries yielded 127 yeast isolates. Also, 12 spontaneous 10-day laboratory sourdough fermentations with daily backslopping were performed with rye, wheat, and spelt flour, resulting in the isolation of 217 yeast colonies. The isolates were grouped according to PCR-fingerprints obtained with the primer M13.

Sequences were used to test the validity of species recognised on morphological criteria and to infer phylogenetic relationships. Sequences of the 11 didymozoids differed by 0.5% to 19%. Our phylogenetic analyses: (i) indicate that species in the genera Helicodidymozoon and Rhopalotrema are a monophyletic group; (ii) support separation of the genus Helicodidymozoon from the genera Indodidymozoon and Neometadidymozoon; and (iii) support recognition of Rhopalotrema as a genus distinct from Neometadidymozoon. We found the gonochoristic species, I. pearsoni and I. suttiei, to be genetically similar to the hermaphroditic species in the genus Indodidymozoon and found no evidence to indicate that they belong in a separate genus.

In the present study, thirty Bacillus isolates were screened from Meju, a Korean soybean fermentation starter. The comparative analysis of 16S rDNA sequences, 16S-23S internal  transcribed  spacer sequences, phenotypic, and biochemical characterizations revealed three phylogenetically distinct groups namely Bacillus atrophaeus, Bacillus polyfermenticus and Bacillus subtilis. The isolates were assayed for poly-γ-glutamate production and fibrinolytic activity. Among the isolates, B. polyfermenticus exhibited maximum poly-γ-glutamate production and fibrinolytic activity. Moreover, the soybean products fermented by B. polyfermenticus have increased the time taken for coagulation and...

Most scleractinian coral species are widely distributed across the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific. However, the genetic connectivity between populations of corals separated by large distances (thousands of kilometers) is not well known. We analyzed variability in the nucleotide sequence of the internal  transcribed  spacer -1 (ITS-1) of the nuclear ribosomal gene unit in the ubiquitous coral Stylophora pistillata, across the western Pacific Ocean. Eight populations from Japan, Malaysia, and the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were studied. Phylogenetic analyses and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) clearly revealed that there is panmixia among these coral populations. AMOVA showed that ITS-1 sequence variability was greater within populations (78.37%) than among populations (12.06%). These patterns strongly suggest high levels of connectivity across the species&apos; latitudinal distribution range in the western Pacific, as is seen in many marine invertebrates.

Crouch, R.J.       The authors have studied differences in molecular structures of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNAs) from different heterothallic species of Neurospora: N. crassa, N. intermedia and N. sitophila to detect any possible differences in rDNA sequences of these three species. The authors have made a new clone (named by us as pCC3400) which contains 3250 bps of the external spacer region of N. crassa wild type strain 74A rDNA sequences. This should contain both the promoter and termination regulatory sites for transcription of rRNA. Using this probe the authors have identified that about 300 bp sequences of the external spacer region present in N. crassa are apparently deleted in the species N. intermedia and N. sitophila, based on restriction patterns of 12 different enzymes. Also new restriction sites were determined as a result of the DNA sequencing of the entire ITS ( internal  transcribed  spacer ) region of the pMF2 N. crassa rDNA clone. These results were used to look at differences in the ITS regions. In addition the authors have identified a Sma 1 site within 26S rDNA which is deleted from N. intermedia but present in both N. sitophila and N. crassa. An Nru 1 site was detected in the NTES regions of N. sitophila and of N. intermedia which was not present in that position in N. crassa. All of these studies clearly establish polymorphism of Neurospora rRNA genes.

Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)       53   UNITE: a database providing web-based methods for the molecular identification of ectomycorrhizal fungi      2005-01-01    Identification of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi is often achieved through comparisons of ribosomal DNA internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) sequences with accessioned sequences deposited in public databases. A major problem encountered is that annotation of the sequences in these databases is not always complete or trustworthy. In order to overcome this deficiency, we report on UNITE, an open-access database.   â¢Â   UNITE comprises well annotated fungal ITS sequences from well defined herbarium specimens that include full herbarium reference identification data, collector/source and ecological data. At present UNITE contains 758 ITS sequences from 455 species and 67 genera of ECM fungi.   â¢Â   UNITE can be searched by taxon name, via sequence similarity using blastn, and via phylogenetic sequence identification using galaxie. Following implementation, galaxie performs a phylogenetic analysis of the query sequence after alignment either to pre-existing generic alignments, or to matches retrieved from a blast search on the UNITE data. It should be noted that the current version of UNITE is dedicated to the reliable identification of ECM fungi.   â¢Â   The UNITE database is accessible through the URL http://unite.zbi.ee     DEFF Research Database (Denmark)       54   Molecular and morphological diversity of pezizalean ectomycorrhiza.      2006-01-01    A growing body of molecular research is discovering a high diversity of pezizalean ectomycorrhiza (EcM), yet most remain unidentified at the genus or species level. This study describes EcM-forming taxa within the Pezizales. EcM-forming Pezizales were revealed by morphotyping and sequencing of EcM root tips from forests in Estonia and Denmark. The taxa on EcM root tips were identified using phylogenetic analyses of large-subunit rDNA sequences derived from sporocarps of 301 pezizalean species, and comparisons with internal  transcribed  spacer rDNA sequences. Thirty-three species are suggested as EcM symbionts, representing all three major clades of Pezizales, the genera Genea, Geopora, Humaria, Tarzetta, Trichophaea, Wilcoxina, Helvella, Hydnotrya, Tuber, Pachyphloeus, Peziza and Sarcosphaera, and two Pezizaceae anamorphs. EcM of Pezizales species are easily distinguished by their anatomy, particularly thick cell walls and stout hyphae. This study demonstrates that Pezizales species constitute a considerable proportion of the mycobionts in EcM fungal communities in mature boreal deciduous and coniferous forests, in several soil types. Fruit-body sequences and EcM descriptions will facilitate identification of pezizalean EcM in future studies.     DEFF Research Database (Denmark)       55   Disproportionate abundance between ectomycorrhizal root tips and their associated mycelia.      2006-01-01    Extensive knowledge of various ectomycorrhizal fungal communities has been obtained over the past 10 years based on molecular identification of the fungi colonizing fine roots. In contrast, only limited information exists about the species composition of ectomycorrhizal hyphae in soil. This study compared the ectomycorrhizal external mycelial community with the adjacent root-tip community in a Danish beech forest. Sand-filled in-growth mesh bags were used to trap external mycelia by incubating the mesh bags in the soil for 70 days. The adjacent ectomycorrhizal root-tip communities were recorded at the times of insertion and retrieval of the mesh bags. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were identified by sequencing the internal  transcribed  spacer region. In total, 20, 31 and 24 ectomycorrhizal species were recorded from the two root-tip harvests and from the mesh bags, respectively. Boletoid species were significantly more frequent as mycelia than as root tips, while russuloid and Cortinarius species appeared to be less dominant as mycelia than as root tips. Tomentella species were equally frequent as root tips and as mycelia. These discrepancies between the root-tip and the mycelial view of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community are discussed within the framework of ectomycorrrhizal exploration types.

Inaccurate species identification confounds insect ecological studies. Examining aspects of Trichogramma ecology pertinent to the novel insect resistance management strategy for future transgenic cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., production in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) of Western Australia required accurate differentiation between morphologically similar Trichogramma species. Established molecular diagnostic methods for Trichogramma identification use species-specific sequence difference in the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS)-2 chromosomal region; yet, difficulties arise discerning polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments of similar base pair length by gel electrophoresis. This necessitates the restriction enzyme digestion of PCR-amplified ITS-2 fragments to readily differentiate Trichogramma australicum Girault and Trichogramma pretiosum Riley. To overcome the time and expense associated with a two-step diagnostic procedure, we developed a“one-step”multiplex PCR technique using species-specific primers designed to the ITS-2 region. This approach allowed for a high-throughput analysis of samples as part of ongoing ecological studies examining Trichogramma biological control potential in the ORIA where these two species occur in sympatry.

M.; Morgan, J. A.; Galzin, R.; Cribb, T. H.       Three coral reef fish species, Zanclus cornutus, Chaetodon vagabundus and Naso lituratus, were collected in French Polynesia and on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland. These fish species were each infected by one morphologically similar digenean species in both localities; Schistorchis Zancli Hanson, 1953 was found in Zanclus cornutus. Preptetos laguncula Bray and Cribb, 1996 in Naso lituratus and Neohypocreadium dorsoporum Machida and Uchida, 1987 in Chaetodon vagabundus. In addition, on the Great Barrier Reef P. laguncula was also found in Naso unicornis and N. dorsoporum in Chaetodon ephippium and Chaetodon flavirostris. Morphometric differences between the species from the two sites were only slight. Sequences from the second internal  transcribed  spacer of the ribosomal DNA of each worm revealed total homology or negligible divergence between samples from hosts caught in French Polynesia and on the Great Barrier Reef. These results show that across more than 6000 km these digeneans are similar in morphology and genotype. Some species of fishes and molluscs a-re considered to have distributions that encompass the entire tropical Indo-West Pacific. These findings suggest that at least some of their parasites have similarly broad distributions. (C) 2001 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

K.; Harrison, Dion K.; Johnston, Margaret E.; Williams, Richard R.       A complete botanical key for the genus Ptilotus R. Brown ( family Amarathaceae) has not yet been published. Identifying the 100 or more Ptilotus species using morphological characters has been difficult because plants often exhibit slight morphological differences and intermediate characteristics common to several species, subspecies, varieties and forms. Ptilotus exaltatus Nees and P. nobilis ( Lindl) F. Muell share many morphological characteristics, but are classified as different species predominantly based on inflorescence colour. The current study involved a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 14 Ptilotus species using sequence data from the internal  transcribed  spacer ( ITS) regions ITS 1 and ITS 2 within the 18S-26S nuclear rDNA. Of the 39 accessions analysed, all except those identified as P. exaltatus and P. nobilis clustered according to their respective species based on their morphological taxonomy. In contrast, all 18 P. exaltatus and P. nobilis accessions formed a distinct monophyletic clade with 99% bootstrap values and a low level of sequence variation ( GD=0.002). Taking into account the lack of reliable morphological characters for separating P. exaltatus and P. nobilis, together with the ITS sequence data showing little genetic divergence or genetic structure, we propose that P. exaltatus and P. nobilis are conspecific.

High molecular nuclear DNAs were isolated from three developmental cell types of N. crassa: conidia, mycelia and germinated conidia, and from mycelial cells of two other heterothallic species, N. intermedia and N. sitophila. These nuclear DNAs were treated with several restriction enzymes: EcoR1, Bam H1, Hind III, Hinc II, Bgl II, Sma I and Pst 1. All seven restriction enzymes were tested on 0.7% agarose gels. EcoR1, Hind III, Pst 1, and Hinc II showed band differences among the species, but not among the cell types. Southern blot transfers of restricted DNA gels were then hybridized with TSP-labelled pMF2 rDNAs (probe). This later DNA was prepared from N. crassa rDNA cloned into pBR322 plasmid, obtained from Dr. Robert Metzenberg of the University of Wisconsin. Autoradiograms of these hybrids between southern blots and probe DNA revealed similar rDNA band patterns confirming the observations on restriction gels. In the case of EcoR1 restriction analysis there were differences in fragments on 0.7% agarose gel, but after hybridization of southern blots no differences in band patterns were seen in autoradiograms.

This mould growth can be extensive and cover several square meters of the blind floor with potential health risks as a consequence. Mould occurrence and mould species diversity were investigated in a large small-house area in the south of Sweden, comprising 212 buildings. The crawl spaces were inspected and samples from the blind floor were taken. The relative humidity was measured and reached 80-100% for several consecutive months. Subsets of the samples were cultured and the fungi isolated were further analyzed by sequencing of the Internal  Transcribed  Spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA). The results were compared with results from other, relevant studies and confirm that Penicillium corylophilum is the completely dominating mould species in crawl spaces. The occurrences could not be explained as accidental since the extensive occurrence in many dwellings had developed over several years.

Although nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats evolve together through concerted evolution, some genomes contain a considerable diversity of paralogous rDNA. This diversity includes not only multiple functional loci but also putative pseudogenes and recombinants. We examined the occurrence of divergent paralogues and recombinants in Gossypium, Nicotiana, Tripsacum, Winteraceae, and Zea ribosomal internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) sequences. Some of the divergent paralogues are probably rDNA pseudogenes, since they have low predicted secondary structure stability, high substitution rates, and many deamination-driven substitutions at methylation sites. Under standard PCR conditions, the low stability paralogues amplified well, while many high-stability paralogues amplified poorly. Under highly denaturing PCR conditions (i.e., with dimethylsulfoxide), both low- and high-stability paralogues amplified well. We also found recombination between divergent paralogues. For phylogenetics, divergent ribosomal paralogues can aid in reconstructing ancestral states and thus serve as good outgroups. Divergent paralogues can also provide companion rDNA phylogenies. However, phylogeneticists must discriminate among families of divergent paralogues and recombinants or suffer from muddled and inaccurate organismal phylogenies. 56 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.

Prasad [Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chandigarh (India)]   2007-01-15    Three strains (AP19, AP19-4 and AP19-6) of a novel yeast species were isolated from soil from the Singareni coal mines, Andhra Pradesh, India. They were morphologically, physiologically and phylogenetically identical and produced one to four spherical ascospores per ascus. Phylogenetic analysis using the D1/D2 variable domain of the large-subunit rRNA gene indicated that the closest relative of these strains is Debaryomyces etchellsii (2.6% divergence). Other species related to these strains are D. mycophilus (5.1% divergence) and species of the D. hansenii cluster (4.9-5.6% divergence). The novel species differs by 20 and 15 physiological tests from D. etchellsii and D. mycophilus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) region also indicated that strains of the new species are related to D. etchellsii (7.7% divergence), followed by species of the D. hansenii cluster (9-10% divergence). In the small-subunit rRNA gene sequences, they differed from D. etchellsii by seven substitutions and one insertion or deletion of a base in a sequence (indel) and from D. mycophilus by 17 substitutions and 1 indel. The physiological, biochemical and molecular data suggest that these strains belong to a novel species, for which we propose the name Debaryomyces singareniensis sp. nov. The Mycobank number of the new species is MB510046.

DNA sequence data from three chloroplast regions (ndhF, trnL-F and psbA-trnH) and the nuclear ribosomal internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) region were analysed separately and in combination using parsimony and Bayesian inference. A total of 163 ingroup taxa were included, of which 60 were sampled for all four markers. Conflicts between chloroplast and nuclear data were assessed using partitioned Bremer support (PBS). Rather than averaging PBS over several trees from constrained searches, individual trees were considered by evaluating PBS ranges. Criteria to be used in the detection of a significant conflict between data partitions are proposed. Three nodes in the total data tree were found to encompass significant conflict that could result from ancient hybridization. Neither of the large, heterogeneous and widespread genera Inula and Pulicaria is monophyletic. A monophyletic group (&quot;the Inula complex&quot;) that comprises all species of Inula includes also Telekia, Carpesium, Chrysophthalmum, Rhanteriopsis, Amblyocarpum, and Pentanema sensu stricto. Two species of Pentanema were found to be closer to Blumea (including Blumeopsis and Merrittia) and Caesulia. The monophyletic &quot;Pulicaria complex&quot; includes all taxa with heteromorphic pappus. Within this group, Francoeuria is distinct from Pulicaria and merits recognition as a separate genus.

Under highly denaturing PCR conditions (i.e., with dimethylsulfoxide), both low- and high-stability paralogues amplified well. We also found recombination between divergent paralogues. For phylogenetics, divergent ribosomal paralogues can aid in reconstructing ancestral states and thus serve as good outgroups. Divergent paralogues can also provide companion rDNA phylogenies. However, phylogeneticists must discriminate among families of divergent paralogues and recombinants or suffer from muddled and inaccurate organismal phylogenies. 56 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.

These toxins have toxicologically relevant effects on humans and animals that eat contaminated foods. In this study, a diagnostic DNA microarray was developed for the identification of the most common food-borne fungi, as well as the genes leading to toxin production.ResultsA total of 40 potentially mycotoxigenic fungi isolated from different food commodities, as well as the genes that are involved in the mycotoxin synthetic pathways, were analyzed. For fungal identification, oligonucleotide probes were designed by exploiting the sequence variations of the elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) coding regions and the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) regions of the rRNA gene cassette. For the detection of fungi able to produce mycotoxins, oligonucleotide probes directed towards genes leading to toxin production from different fungal strains were identified in data available in the public domain. The probes selected for fungal identification and the probes specific for toxin producing genes were spotted onto microarray slides.ConclusionsThe diagnostic microarray developed can be used to identify single pure strains or cultures of potentially mycotoxigenic fungi as well as genes leading to toxin production in both laboratory samples and maize-derived foods offering an interesting potential for microbiological laboratories.

AMF were detected in 21 of 22 plant species analyzed. Mean mycorrhization levels reached up to 74.5% root length colonized. AMF diversity was analyzed based on 104 sequences of the internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 6 species all belonging to the genus Glomus. There was no overlap between species detected as active mycorrhizas on roots (2 taxa) or as spores (4 taxa). Compared to the regional context, the diversity of AMF at our field site was reduced, which may reflect a residual disturbance effect. However, none of the detected species was exclusive to the polluted site as they are commonly found in the region. - Almost all plant species were mycorrhizal.

Soil basidiomycetes play key roles in forest nutrient and carbon cycling processes, yet the diversity and structure of below ground basidiomycete communities remain poorly understood. Prescribed burning is a commonly used forest management practice and there is evidence that single fire events can have an impact on soil fungal communities but little is known about the effects of repeated prescribed burning. We have used internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS) terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis to investigate the impacts of repeated prescribed burning every two or four years over a period of 30 years on soil basidiomycete communities in an Australian wet sclerophyll forest. Detrended correspondence analysis of ITS T-RFLP profiles separated basidiomycete communities in unburned control plots from those in burned plots, with those burned every two years being the most different from controls. Burning had no effect on basidiomycete species richness, thus these differences appear to be due to changes in community structure. Basidiomycete communities in the unburned control plots were vertically stratified in the upper 20 cm of soil, but no evidence was found for stratification in the burned plots, suggesting that repeated prescribed burning results in more uniform basidiomycete communities. Overall, the results demonstrate that repeated prescribed burning alters soil basidiomycete communities, with the effect being greater with more frequent burning.2007C1Yes                                     Publisher: U.K. Cambridge University Press                                                                                                        Format: 5                                                                                                                                            Language: eng                                                     Source: Mycological Research Vol. 111, no. 4 (Apr. 2007), pp. 482-486 Refereed     ARROW Discovery Service (Australia)       69   Belowground ectomycorrhizal fungal communities respond to liming in three southern Swedish coniferous forest stands      2009-01-01    In this study we report on changes in the belowground ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in southern Swedish coniferous forests as a consequence of liming with 3-7Â ton limestone per hectare 16 years prior to the study.  A total of 107 ectomycorrhizal fungi were identified from 969 independently sampled root tips by sequencing the internal  transcribed  spacer region of the ribosomal DNA. Forty, 59 and 51 species were identified in three pine and spruce forests. Within all sites only about 25% of the species overlapped between the limed and the reference areas. However, the most abundant species were often found in both limed and reference plots and 60-70% of the root tips at each site were colonised by species occurring in both limed and reference plots.  Across all three sites, fungal species belonging to the genus Tylospora and the order Pezizales became significantly more frequent in limed plots, while species belonging to the genera Russula and Lactarius decreased in frequency. At individual sites, several species within the genera Amphinema, Piloderma, Inocybe and Hygrophorus were also significantly influenced by liming. We estimate that, at the root tip level, about 30% of the roots were colonised by a different fungal species as a consequence of liming. The observed shift in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities was related to an increased pH and base saturation with liming.  We conclude that even a moderate level of liming have long lasting effects on belowground ectomycorrhizal community composition. We discuss the observed community changes in relation to ectomycorrhizal functionality and biodiversity in limed forests.     DEFF Research Database (Denmark)       70   Molecular screening for Candida orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis among Danish Candida parapsilosis group blood culture isolates: proposal of a new RFLP profile for differentiation      2010-01-01    Candida orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis are recently described species phenotypically indistinguishable from Candida parapsilosis . We evaluated phenotyping and molecular methods for the detection of these species among 79 unique blood culture isolates of the C. parapsilosis group obtained during the years 2004-2008. The isolates were screened by PCR amplification of the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding gene ( SADH) followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme Ban I, using C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. orthopsilosis ATCC 96139 and C. metapsilosis ATCC 96144 as controls. Isolates with RFLP patterns distinct from C. parapsilosis were characterized by sequence analysis of the ITS1-ITS2, 26S rRNA (D1/D2) and SADH regions. Restriction patterns for the 3 species with each of 610 restriction enzymes were predicted in silico using 12 available sequences. By PCR-RFLP of the SADH gene alone, four isolates (5.1 %) had a pattern identical to the C. orthopsilosis reference strain. Sequence analysis of SADH and ITS ( internal  transcribed  spacer ) regions identified two of these isolates as C. metapsilosis. These results were confirmed by creating a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of SADH, ITS and 26S rRNA gene sequence regions. Optimal differentiation between C. parapsilosis, C. metapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis was predicted using digestion with NlaIII, producing discriminatory band sizes of: 131 and 505 bp; 74, 288 and 348 bp; and 131, 217 and 288 bp, respectively. This was confirmed using the reference strains and 79 clinical isolates. In conclusion, reliable discrimination was obtained by PCR-RFLP profile analysis of the SADH gene after digestion with NlaIII but not with BanI. C. metapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis are involved in a small but significant number of invasive infections in Denmark.

[Lab. of Forest Chemistry and Biochemistry, Kyushu Univ., Fukuoka (Japan)]   2003-07-01    Bioremediation is a low-cost treatment alternative for the cleanup of polychlorinated-dioxin-contaminated soils and fly ash when pollution spread is wide-ranging. An interesting fungus, Ceriporia sp. MZ-340, with a high ability to degrade dioxin, was isolated from white rotten wood of a broadleaf tree from Kyushu Island in Japan. We have attempted to use the fungus for bioremediation of polychlorinated-dioxin-contaminated soil on site. However, we have to consider that this trial has the potential problem of introducing a biohazard to a natural ecosystem if this organism is naturalized. We have therefore developed a monitoring system for the introduced fungus as a part of the examination and evaluation of bioremediation in our laboratory. We have also developed a PCR-based assay to reliably detect the fungus at the bioremediation site. DNA isolated from the site was amplified by PCR using a specific primer derived from internal  transcribed  spacer region (ITS: ITS1, 5.8S rDNA and ITS2) sequences of ceriporia sp. MZ-340. We successfully monitored Ceriporia sp. MZ-340 down to 100 fg/{mu}l DNA and down to 2 mg/g mycelium. We also successfully monitored the fungus specifically at the bioremediation site. The polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorinated dibenzofuran content was observed to decrease in response to treatment with the fungus. The species-specific PCR technique developed in the present work is useful in evaluating the possibility of on-site bioremediation using the fungus Ceriporia sp. MZ-340. (orig.)     Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)       72    http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:77033    Nolan, M. J.; Cribb, T. H.       In just over a decade, the use of molecular approaches for the recognition of parasites has become commonplace. For trematodes, the internal  transcribed  spacer region of ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) has become the default region of choice. Here, we review the findings of 63 studies that report ITS rDNA sequence data for about 155 digenean species from 19 families, and then review the levels of variation that have been reported and how the variation has been interpreted. Overall, complete ITS sequences (or ITS1 or ITS2 regions alone) usually distinguish trematode species clearly, including combinations for which morphology gives ambiguous results. Closely related species may have few base differences and in at least one convincing case the ITS2 sequences of two good species are identical. In some cases, the ITS1 region gives greater resolution than the ITS2 because of the presence of variable repeat units that are generally lacking in the ITS2. Intraspecific variation is usually low and frequently apparently absent. Information on geographical variation of digeneans is limited but at least some of the reported variation probably reflects the presence of multiple species. Despite the accepted dogma that concerted evolution makes the individual representative of the entire species, a significant number of studies have reported at least some intraspecific variation. The significance of such variation is difficult to assess a posteriori, but it seems likely that identification and sequencing errors account for some of it and failure to recognise separate species may also be significant. Some reported variation clearly requires further analysis. The use of a yardstick to determine when separate species should be recognised is flawed. Instead, we argue that consistent genetic differences that are associated with consistent morphological or biological traits should be considered the marker for separate species. We propose a generalised approach to the use of rDNA to distinguish trematode species.

The genus is a model for studies in the evolution of phytophagous insects and their host-plant associations. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny to provide a solid framework for these studies, and to obtain insight into the history of host-plant use and the biogeography of the genus.Methodology/Principal FindingsDNA sequences from an internal  transcribed  spacer region (ITS-1) and from the 16S rDNA (16S) and cytochrome oxidase (COII) mitochondrial genes were collected from 20–23 (depending on gene) species and two outgroup taxa to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Palaearctic members of this genus. Sequences were analysed using three different phylogenetic methods (parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference).Conclusions/SignificanceRoughly the same patterns are retrieved irrespective of the method used, and they are similar among the three genes. Monophyly is well supported for a clade consisting of the Japanese (but not the Dutch) population of Yponomeuta sedellus and Y. yanagawanus, a Y. kanaiellus–polystictus clade, and a Rosaceae-feeding, western Palaearctic clade (Y. cagnagellus–irrorellus clade). Within these clades, relationships are less well supported, and the patterns between the different gene trees are not so similar. The position of the remaining taxa is also variable among the gene trees and rather weakly supported. The phylogenetic information was used to elucidate patterns of biogeography and resource use. In the Palaearctic, the genus most likely originated in the Far East, feeding on Celastraceae, dispersing to the West concomitant with a shift to Rosaceae and further to Salicaceae. The association of Y. cagnagellus with Euonymus europaeus (Celastraceae), however, is a reversal. The only oligophagous species, Y. padellus, belongs to the derived western Palaearctic clade, evidence that specialisation is reversible.

The strains were confirmed to be A. flavus by molecular methods (amplification of the internal  transcribed  spacer 2 [ITS 2] region and direct sequencing followed by comparative GenBank analysis). The aflatoxin-producing potential of each strain was determined by thin-layer chromatography. The ability of each strain to form sclerotia in Czapek-Dox agar (CDA) after 7 days incubation at 30 °C in the dark and to produce a beige ring in yeast extract sucrose agar supplemented with methylβ-cyclodextrin and sodium desoxycholate (YESD medium) after 3 days incubation at 30 °C was also assessed. For comparison, the tests were also run on 10 strains of A. flavus (identity confirmed by molecular methods) collected from local farming areas (environmental isolates).ResultsAflatoxin B1 was detected in 16 (80%) of 20 culture filtrate or mycelial homogenate samples of the clinical isolates (mean concentration: 366.7±125.4 parts per billion [ppb]) but in only eight (40%) of 20 samples of environmental isolates (mean concentration: 306.6±125.4 ppb). Seven of the eight aflatoxin-producing clinical isolates and two of the four aflatoxin-producing environmental isolates formed sclerotia (&gt;400μm) and a beige ring in culture.ConclusionsAflatoxin B1 was detected in a significantly higher percentage of growth samples of clinical isolates (80%) than growth samples of environmental isolates (40%) (χ 2 =6.667; p=0.0098); the therapeutic implications of this finding require further study. The production of sclerotia and a beige ring in culture appear to be useful markers of aflatoxin-producing potential in strains of A. flavus isolated from keratitis.

[Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dept. of Plant Biology, Urbana, Illinois (United States)]   2002-12-15    Cladistic analyses of DNA sequences from the nuclear rDNA internal  transcribed  spacer region and cpDNA rps16 intron and, for a subset of taxa, the cpDNA trnF-trnL-trnT locus were carried out to evaluate the monophyly of Cymopterus and to ascertain its phylogenetic placement among the other perennial genera of Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) subfamily Apioideae endemic to western North America. To elucidate patterns in the evolution of specific fruit characters and to evaluate their utility in circumscribing genera unambiguously, additional evidence was procured from cross-sections of mature fruits and the results of cladistic analysis of 25 morphological characters. Analyses of the partitioned data sets resulted in weakly supported and largely unresolved phylogenetic hypotheses, possibly due to the rapid radiation of the group, whereas the combined analysis of all molecular evidence resulted in a well-resolved phylogeny with higher bootstrap support. The traditionally used fruit characters of wing shape and composition and orientation of mericarp compression are highly variable. The results of these analyses reveal that Cymopterus and Lomatium, the two largest genera of western North American Apiaceae, are polyphyletic, and that their species are inextricably linked with those of other endemic perennial genera of the region (such as, Aletes, Musineon, Oreoxis, Pseudocymopterus, Pteryxia, and Tauschia), many of which are also not monophyletic. Prior emphasis on characters of the fruit in all systems of classification of the group has led to highly artificial assemblages of species. A complete reassessment of generic limits of all western endemic Apiaceae is required, as is further systematic study of this intractable group.

Morphological and phylogenetic analyses identified all strains as Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima, but in the phylogenetic analyses they fell into two genetically distinct clades. Studies of fine structural morphological characteristics by electron microscopy did not allow discrimination of the two clades. Mating experiments showed successful sexualisation among strains of clade B/1; whereas, mating attempts in clade A/2 and between clade A/2 and clade B/1 were unsuccessful under the examined laboratory conditions. The morphological characteristics of the daughter generations F1 and F2 were analyzed and abnormalities in the F2 generation described. We describe for the first time the rapid size reduction in the F2 generation. Culture studies showed physiological differences between the two clades; strains from clade A/2 showed a tendency for higher growth rates and slower reduction in cell size than strains from clade B/1. Morphological and phylogenetic studies comparing strains from different parts of the world showed P. delicatissima as a cryptic species complex comprising at least two different genotypes, both apparently cosmopolitan. The two genotypes were shown to occur sympatrically in the Mediterranean Sea, and we hypothesize that the genotypes were most likely separated by reproductive barriers associated with sexualisation occurring at different temperatures and hence different seasons. The molecular and physiological differences allow us to describe one of the genotypes, clade B/1, as a new species, Pseudo-nitzschia arenysensis sp. nov. Differences in growth capabilities of the cultures were observed in relation to cell size and physiological status and showed a nonlinear relationship between cell size and growth. Possibly, such capability plays a key role in the occurrence and dynamics of phytoplankton algae.

[Evolution and Ecology Research Centre, School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052 (Australia)], E-mail: w.ballard@unsw.edu.au   2008-09-15    To monitor genetic diversity and environmental contamination in eastern Australia, toxicity studies have employed the sensitive benthic amphipod Melita plumulosa. The goal of this study was to examine the genetic and life-history variability of natural populations of M. plumulosa from the Parramatta (polluted) and Hawkesbury (unpolluted) Rivers. The underlying genetics of the populations in these distinct waterways was examined at one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)) and one nuclear (ribosomal internal  transcribed  spacer region 1 (ITS1)) locus. Seven unique haplotypes for COI were found amongst animals from the Parramatta River, while animals from the Hawkesbury River showed a complete absence of genetic variation at this locus. At ITS1 a total of two sequence variants were found amongst Parramatta River amphipods and three sequence variants among Hawkesbury River animals, with no common variants across the two river systems. To establish whether genetic differences were associated with organismal responses to toxicant exposure, two life-history trait variables (female head length as an estimator of amphipod size and female fecundity) were analyzed. Life-history trait analyses showed that females from the Hawkesbury River were significantly larger and more fecund. These data have critical implications for toxicity tests, the use of laboratory cultures for testing purposes, and environmental contamination in Sydney Harbor.

The entire internal  transcribed  spacer ( ITS) region, including the 5.8S subunit of the nuclear ribosomal DNA ( rDNA), was sequenced by direct double-stranded sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified fragments. The study included 40 Sporobolus ( Family Poaceae, subfamily Chloridoideae) seed collections from 14 putative species ( all 11 species from the S. indicus complex and three Australian native species). These sequences, along with those from two out-group species [ Pennisetum alopecuroides ( L.) Spreng. and Heteropogon contortus ( L.) P. Beauv. ex Roemer&amp;Schultes, Poaceae, subfamily Panicoideae], were analysed by the parsimony method (PAUP; version 4.0b4a) to infer phylogenetic relationships among these species. The length of the ITS1, 5.8S subunit and ITS2 region were 222, 164 and 218 base pairs ( bp), respectively, in all species of the S. indicus complex, except for the ITS2 region of S. diandrus P. Beauv. individuals, which was 217 bp long. Of the 624 characters included in the analysis, 245 ( 39.3%) of the 330 variable sites contained potential phylogenetic information. Differences in sequences among the members of the S. pyramidalis P. Beauv., S. natalensis (Steud.) Dur&amp;Schinz and S. jacquemontii Kunth. collections were 0%, while differences ranged from 0 to 2% between these and other species of the complex. Similarly, differences in sequences among collections of S. laxus B. K. Simon, S. sessilis B. K. Simon, S. elongatus R. Br. and S. creber De Nardi were 0%, compared with differences of 1-2% between these four species and the rest of the complex. When comparing S. fertilis ( Steud.) Clayton and S. africanus (Poir.) Robyns&amp;Tourney, differences between collections ranged from 0 to 1%. Parsimony analysis grouped all 11 species of the S. indicus complex together, indicating a monophyletic origin. For the entire data set, pair-wise distances among members of the S. indicus complex varied from 0.00 to 1.58%, compared with a range of 20.08-21.44% among species in the complex and the Australian native species studied. A strict consensus phylogenetic tree separated 11 species of the S. indicus complex into five major clades. The phylogeny, based on ITS sequences, was found to be congruent with an earlier study on the taxonomic relationship of the weedy Sporobolus grasses revealed from random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD). However, this cladistic analysis of the complex was not in agreement with that created on past morphological analyses and therefore gives a new insight into the phylogeny of the S. indicus complex.

In the present study we made a polyphasic characterization of 39 strains morphologically identifiable as belonging to the A. infectoria species-group together with 12 strains belonging to closely related species: Alternaria malorum (syn. Cladosporium malorum), Chalastospora cetera (syn. Alternaria cetera) and Embellisia abundans. Morphological examination separated the 51 strains in three groups based on conidial appearance and arrangement: the A. infectoria species-group, E. abundans and a group containing C cetera and A. malorum. The metabolite analyses on three different media showed two clusters, one containing all 39 A. infectoria species-group strains and one containing 10 strains of E. abundans, C cetera and A. malorum. One E. abundans strain and one A. malorum strain were not included due to insufficient metabolite production. The separation of the A. infectoria species-group from E. abundans, C cetera and A. malorum resulted mainly from the ability to produce altertoxins and novae-zelandins. The metabolite analyses also showed that all 51 strains were able to produce infectopyrones. The metabolite profiles of C cetera and A. malorum were very similar with several metabolites of unknown structure in common. This is the first time that E. abundans, C cetera and A. malorum have been reported as producers of infectopyrones. Sequence analyses of the internal  transcribed  spacer region (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) and translocation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef-1 alpha) showed two clades: one with the 39 strains from the A. infectoria species-group and one with the 12 strains of E. abundans, C cetera and A. malorum. The polyphasic approach in this study suggests that A. malorum var. polymorpha and the eight A. malorum strains do not belong in Alternaria, but in Chalastospora, however, as several distinct species. Splits Tree alignment of gpd sequences of 38 strains belonging to the A. infectoria species-group indicates that only three strains showed signs of recombination, while the remaining strains appeared to be clonal. Long term incubation at 7 degrees C in the dark showed that 12 out of 33 tested strains from the A. infectoria species-group were able to produce proascomata in axenic culture, but with no mature ascospores after 6 months. These findings suggest that Lewia/A. infectoria species-group must, at least in part, be homothallic. The results presented in this study show that ITS, tef-1 alpha and gpd do not reflect ecology, secondary metabolism or morphology of the A. infectoria species-group and that molecular cladification and phylogeny cannot predict pathogenicity, host specificity or mycotoxin production.

We describe an unprecedented radiation of sanguinicolid blood flukes ( Digenea: Sanguinicolidae) from two species of Labridae (Choerodon venustus and C. cauteroma), seven species of Mullidae (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis, Parupeneus barberinoides, P. barberinus, P. bifasciatus, P. cyclostomus, P. indicus and P. multifasciatus) and ten species of Siganidae (Siganus argenteus, S. corallinus, S. doliatus, S. fuscescens, S. lineatus, S. margaritiferus, S. puellus, S. punctatus, S. virgatus and S. vulpinus) from sites off Australia and Palau. The flukes were morphologically similar in having the combination of a long thread-like body, tegumental spines in lateral transverse rows, a vestigial oral sucker bearing concentric rows of fine spines, an H-shaped intestine, a cirrussac, a notch level with the male genital pore, a lateral or post-ovarian uterus, a uterine chamber and separate genital pores. These species are divided into two genera on the basis of testis number. Sanguinicolids from Siganus fuscescens have a single large testis between the intestinal bifurcation and the ovary and are placed in Ankistromeces Nolan&amp;Cribb, 2004. Species from the remaining nine species of Siganidae, Labridae and Mullidae are placed in Phthinomita n. g.; these species have two testes, the anterior testis being large and between the intestinal bifurcation and the ovary whereas the small posterior testis is at the posterior end of the body and appears rudimentary or degenerate and probably non-functional. The second internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) from 29 host/parasite/location combinations (h/p/l) was sequenced together with that of Ankistromeces mariae Nolan&amp;Cribb, 2004 for comparison. From 135 samples we found 19 distinct genotypes which were interpreted as representing at least that many species. Replicate sequences were obtained for 25 of 30 h/p/l combinations ( including A. mariae); there was no intraspecific variation between replicates sequences for any of these. Interspecific variation ranged from 1 - 41 base differences (0.3 - 12.7% sequence divergence). The 19 putative species were difficult to recognise by morphological examination. We describe 13 new species; we do not describe (= name) six species characterised solely by molecular sequences and three putative species for which morphological data is available but for which molecular data is not. We have neither morphological nor molecular data for sanguinicolids harboured in five hosts species ( Siganus margaritiferus, S. puellus, Choerodon cauteroma, Parupeneus indicus and P. multifasciatus) in which we have seen infections. Where host species were infected in different localities they almost always harboured distinct species. Some host species ( for example, S. argenteus and S. lineatus from Lizard Island) harboured two or three species in a single geographical location. This suggests that, for parts of this system, parasite speciation has outstripped host speciation. Distance analysis of ITS2 showed species from each host family ( Siganidae, Mullidae and Labridae) did not form monophyletic clades to the exclusion of species from other host families. However, a host defined clade was formed by the sequences from sanguinicolids from S. fuscescens.

P.; Barker, S. C.       The two internal  transcribed  spacer s (ITS) of ribosomal DNA are often used as markers of populations of insects. We studied the ITS2 of the head lice and body lice of humans, to determine whether this gene is a suitable marker of populations of these insects. ITS2 sequences were amplified by PCR from lice from four different countries: Australia, China, Japan and the USA. Direct cycle-sequencing of some of these PCR products gave equivocal nucleotide chromatograms. This indicated that some lice had more than one ITS2 sequence, so we cloned PCR products from these lice. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) revealed that 50 of the 67 clones we screened had different nucleotide sequences. All lice had several ITS2 types, including those with unequivocal chromatograms. A phylogenetic tree of 15 different ITS2 sequences showed that the sequences from individual lice were not monophyletic. We conclude that the ITS2 is not a useful marker of populations for Pediculus humanus.

The effect of a free-living stage in host-parasite coevolution: a skink mite phylogenetic study in New Zealand. During the last decade, phylogenetic trees have even been used to compare ecologically related taxa such as parasites and their hosts, and are used to determine their level of coevolution or reciprocal adaptation in time. Diverse coevolutionary events have been detected for this ecological association, where generally the parasite has been regarded as one that feeds exclusively on the host and is likely to cospeciate with it. A different coevolutionary pattern might occur when the parasite has a free-living stage in its life cycle, in which the parasite may have the opportunity to abandon its host and successfully colonise a new species (host-switching) making cospeciation less likely. Many New Zealand skinks are infested with a parasitic mite, Odontacarus sp. (Prostigmata: Leeuwenhoekiidae), which becomes free-living as an adult. The genetic variation of these mites found on four hosts was analyzed for host- parasite coevolutionary events. The hosts were the McCann’s skink and the common skink in coastal Birdling Flat, Canterbury, plus these species and the Grand and Otago skinks in Macraes Flat, Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand. The genetic variation of fast evolving nuclear Internal  Transcribed  Spacer s 2 and mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase I in Odontacarus mites found on these hosts was determined by PCR and DNA sequencing and phylogenetic trees were built using the computer programs PAUP*4 and MrBayes 3. The results show that mite haplotypes only had a significant geographical division and no host-related differences. In Birdling Flat, the COI haplotypes were represented in two groups that infested both regional hosts and had 5.7 % divergence. The same individual mites belonged to a single ITS 2 haplotype, thus indicating a historical geographical division between two populations that now interbreed successfully. The Macraes Flat mites were divided into two COI haplotypes with 2.4% divergence and internal nodes, which showed greater genetic variability than the Birdling Flat populations. The Macraes Flat mites formed two ITS 2 haplotypes with 6% divergence. This greater geographical structure of the Otago mites is probably due to the older age of the mainland area compared to the recently exposed coastal locality of Birdling Flat. The COI haplotypes from the two different regions had a mean distance of 15.5%, with an earlier divergence time than that known for the hosts. For both genes, the haplotypes from different regions had 100% bootstrap support and the parasite showed no host specificity. Mites of the different COI and ITS haplotypes were found on most of the host species that were sampled in Canterbury and Otago. The results of this study suggest that a free-living stage in a parasite’s life cycle can favour coevolutionary events such as inertia (failure to speciate) and host-switching, probably as a result of resource-tracking of the parasite.

Both polyploidisation and hybridisation contribute to increased variability within species, and may transfer adaptations between species in a changing environment. Studying these aspects of evolution within a diversified species complex could help to clarify overall spatial and temporal patterns of plant speciation. The Arabidopsis lyrata complex, which is closely related to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, is a perennial, outcrossing, herbaceous species complex with a circumpolar distribution in the Northern Hemisphere as well as a disjunct Central European distribution in relictual habitats. This species complex comprises three species and four subspecies, mainly diploids but also several tetraploids, including one natural hybrid. The complex is ecologically, but not fully geographically, separated from members of the closely related species complex of Arabidopsis halleri, and the evolutionary histories of both species compexes have largely been influenced by Pleistocene climate oscillations.ResultsUsing DNA sequence data from the nuclear encoded cytosolic phosphoglucoisomerase and Internal  Transcribed  Spacer s 1 and 2 of the ribosomal DNA, as well as the trnL/F region from the chloroplast genome, we unravelled the phylogeography of the various taxonomic units of the A. lyrata complex. We demonstrate the existence of two major gene pools in Central Europe and Northern America. These two major gene pools are constructed from different taxonomic units. We also confirmed that A. kamchatica is the allotetraploid hybrid between A. lyrata and A. halleri, occupying the amphi-Beringian area in Eastern Asia and Northern America. This species closes the large distribution gap of the various other A. lyrata segregates. Furthermore, we revealed a threefold independent allopolyploid origin of this hybrid species in Japan, China, and Kamchatka.ConclusionsUnglaciated parts of the Eastern Austrian Alps and arctic Eurasia, including Beringia, served as major glacial refugia of the Eurasian A. lyrata lineage, whereas A. halleri and its various subspecies probably survived in refuges in Central Europe and Eastern Asia with a large distribution gap in between. The North American A. lyrata lineage probably survived the glaciation in the southeast of North America. The dramatic climatic changes during glaciation and deglaciation cycles promoted not only secondary contact and formation of the allopolyploid hybrid A. kamchatica, but also provided the environment that allowed this species to fill a large geographic gap separating the two genetically different A. lyrata lineages from Eurasia and North America. With our example focusing on the evolutionary history of the A. lyrata species complex, we add substantial information to a broad evolutionary framework for future investigations within this emerging model system in molecular and evolutionary biology.

The species was found in the Richmond, Clarence, Macleay and Hastings River systems of northern New South Wales. Existing populations had wider leaves (10-15 mM) than those previously reported (4-6 mM). This species and North American wild rice, Zizania palustris were investigated as genetic resource for rice improvement. Both species, Potamophila , and Zizania , occur in colder climates than rice (Oryza sativa). Sequencing of the ITS1 of the ribosomal genes of these two species indicated that Zizania and Potamophila were more closely related to each other than either was to Oryza sativa. Potamophila has a similar number of chromosomes (n=12) and a greater sequence homology to rice and may thus be a better source of useful genes for rice improvement.

For the first time, a combined analysis of the ITS1 regions of all twenty-five Sorghum species has been undertaken. Parsimony analysis revealed a distinct lineage of Sorghum consisting of the cultivated species and their progenitors plus S. angustum, S. brachypodum, S. ecarinatum, S. macrospermum, S. laxiflorum and Saccharum officinarum. A second unsupported lineage consists of the Parasorghum and Stiposorghum species S. grande, S. leiocladum, S. nitidum, S. purpureosericeum, S. timorense, S. versicolor, S. amplum, S. bulbosum, S. interjectum, S. plumosum, S. stipoideum and the African grass Cleistachne sorghoides. Three Australian endemic species, S. angustum, S. brachypodum and S. ecarinatum, are closely related to S. bicolor, with S. angustum showing no difference to S. bicolor in ITS1 sequence. Sorghum macrospermum and S. laxiflorum form a strong clade within the Eusorghum branch indicating closer relationships to this group than to any of the Parasorghum or Stiposorghum species. Saccharum officinarum has shown closer relationships to Sorghum than to Zea mays, while the close relationship of Cleistachne sorghoides to Sorghum has been confirmed. These relationships between Sorghum species provide an important guide for plant breeders to exploit the wider Sorghum genepool through crosses between wild and cultivated species in an effort to improve sorghum production.

However, in 2000 a new race of the pathogen devastated the high-performing sugarcane cultivar Q124, and caused the industry Aus$150–210 million in yield losses. At the time of the epidemic, very little was known about the genetic and pathogenic diversity of the fungus in Australia and neighbouring sugar industries. DNA sequence data from three rDNA regions were used to determine the genetic relationships between isolates within two P. kuehnii collections. The first collection comprised only recent Australian field isolates and limited sequence variation was detected within this population. In the second study, Australian isolates were compared with isolates from Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, China and historical herbarium collections. Greater sequence variation was detected in this collection and phylogenetic analyses grouped the isolates into three clades. All isolates from commercial cane fields clustered together including the recent Australianfield isolates and the Australian historical isolate from 1898.The other two clades included rust isolates from wild and garden canes in Indonesia and PNG. These rusts appeared morphologically similar to P. kuehnii and could potentially pose a quarantine threat to the Australian sugar industry. The results have revealed greater diversity in sugarcane rusts than previously thought.

Science.gov (United States)       94    SSHscreen and SSHdb, generic software for microarray based gene discovery: application to the stress response in cowpea           Full Text Available.BackgroundSuppression subtractive hybridization is a popular technique for gene discovery from non-model organisms without an annotated genome sequence, such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp). We aimed to use this method to enrich for genes expressed during drought stress in a drought tolerant cowpea line. However, current methods were inefficient in screening libraries and management of the sequence data, and thus there was a need to develop software tools to facilitate the process.ResultsForward and reverse cDNA libraries enriched for cowpea drought response genes were screened on microarrays, and the R software package SSHscreen 2.0.1 was developed (i) to normalize the data effectively using spike-in control spot normalization, and (ii) to select clones for sequencing based on the calculation of enrichment ratios with associated statistics. Enrichment ratio 3 values for each clone showed that 62% of the forward library and 34% of the reverse library clones were significantly differentially expressed by drought stress (adjusted p value&lt;0.05). Enrichment ratio 2 calculations showed that&gt;88% of the clones in both libraries were derived from rare transcripts in the original tester samples, thus supporting the notion that suppression subtractive hybridization enriches for rare transcripts. A set of 118 clones were chosen for sequencing, and drought-induced cowpea genes were identified, the most interesting encoding a late embryogenesis abundant Lea5 protein, a glutathione S-transferase, a thaumatin, a universal stress protein, and a wound induced protein. A lipid transfer protein and several components of photosynthesis were down-regulated by the drought stress. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR confirmed the enrichment ratio values for the selected cowpea genes. SSHdb, a web-accessible database, was developed to manage the clone sequences and combine the SSHscreen data with sequence annotations derived from BLAST and Blast2GO. The self-BLAST function within SSHdb grouped redundant clones together and illustrated that the SSHscreen plots are a useful tool for choosing anonymous clones for sequencing, since redundant clones cluster together on the enrichment ratio plots.ConclusionsWe developed the SSHscreen-SSHdb software pipeline, which greatly facilitates gene discovery using suppression subtractive hybridization by improving the selection of clones for sequencing after screening the library on a small number of microarrays. Annotation of the sequence information and collaboration was further enhanced through a web-based SSHdb database, and we illustrated this through identification of drought responsive genes from cowpea, which can now be investigated in gene function studies. SSH is a popular and powerful gene discovery tool, and therefore this pipeline will have application for gene discovery in any biological system, particularly non-model organisms.

In particular, it will be shown that repetitive sequences foster recombination among, and turnover of, the elements of a genome. I will then consider some examples of repetitive sequences, notably minisatellite sequences and telomere sequences as examples of tandem repeats, without and with respectively known function, and Alu sequences as an example of interspersed repeats.

Hong, R. L., Hamaguchi, L., Busch, M. A., and Weigel, D.       OAK-B135 In Arabidopsis thaliana, cis-regulatory sequences of the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) are located in the second intron. This 3 kb intron contains binding sites for two direct activators of AG, LEAFY (LFY) and WUSCHEL (WUS), along with other putative regulatory elements. We have used phylogenetic footprinting and the related technique of phylogenetic shadowing to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in this intron. Among 29 Brassicaceae, several other motifs, but not the LFY and WUS binding sites previously identified, are largely invariant. Using reporter gene analyses, we tested six of these motifs and found that they are all functionally important for activity of AG regulatory sequences in A. thaliana. Although there is little obvious sequence similarity outside the Brassicaceae, the intron from cucumber AG has at least partial activity in A. thaliana. Our studies underscore the value of the comparative approach as a tool that complements gene-by-gene promoter dissection, but also highlight that sequence-based studies alone are insufficient for a complete identification of cis-regulatory sites.

In the current study, we investigated the relationships between HCV genome replication, virus production, and the structure of N5BX. We found that the Q377R, A450S, S455N, R517K, and Y561F mutations in the NS5B region resulted in up-regulation of J6CF NS5B polymerase activity in vitro. However, the activation effects of these mutations on viral RNA replication and virus production with JFH-1 N3H appeared to differ. In the presence of the N3H region and 3′untranslated region (UTR) of JFH-1, A450S, R517K, and Y561F together were sufficient to confer HCV genome replication activity and virus production ability to J6CF in cultured cells. Y561F was also involved in the kissing-loop interaction between SL3.2 in the NS5B region and SL2 in the 3′X region. We next analyzed the 3′structure of HCV genome RNA. The shorter polyU/UC tracts of JFH-1 resulted in more efficient RNA replication than J6CF. Furthermore, 9458G in the JFH-1 variable region (VR) was responsible for RNA replication activity because of its RNA structures. In conclusion, N3H, high polymerase activity, enhanced kissing-loop interactions, and optimal viral RNA structure in the 3′UTR were required for J6CF replication in cultured cells.

Although, the recommended method for discriminating bacterial species is DNA-DNA hybridisation, alternative techniques based on multigenic sequence analysis are becoming a common practice in bacterial species discrimination studies. Since there is not a general criterion for determining which genes are more useful for species resolution; the number of strains and genes analysed is increasing continuously. As a result, sequences of different genes are dispersed throughout several databases. This sequence information needs to be collected in a common database, in order to be useful for future identification-based projects.DescriptionThe PseudoMLSA Database is a comprehensive database of multiple gene sequences from strains of Pseudomonas species. The core of the database is composed of selected gene sequences from all Pseudomonas type strains validly assigned to the genus through 2008. The database is aimed to be useful for MultiLocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) procedures, for the identification and characterisation of any Pseudomonas bacterial isolate. The sequences are available for download via a direct connection to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Additionally, the database includes an online BLAST interface for flexible nucleotide queries and similarity searches with the user&apos;s datasets, and provides a user-friendly output for easily parsing, navigating, and analysing BLAST results.ConclusionsThe PseudoMLSA database amasses strains and sequence information of validly described Pseudomonas species, and allows free querying of the database via a user-friendly, web-based interface available at http://www.uib.es/microbiologiaBD/Welcome.html. The web-based platform enables easy retrieval at strain or gene sequence information level; including references to published peer-reviewed articles, and direct external links to more specialized strain information databases (StrainInfo) and GeneBank (NCBI). The PseudoMLSA is intended to provide helpful strain-sequence information for a better and more comprehensive discriminative multigenic sequence based analysis of this special group of bacteria, contributing to enhance our understanding of the evolution of Pseudomonas species.

Molecular identification and discrimination of different Dunaliella species were carried out based on the size of 18S rDNA gene and, number and position of introns in the gene. Three types of 18S rDNA structure have already been reported: the gene with a size of ~1770 bp lacking any intron, with a size of ~2170 bp consisting one intron near 5&apos; terminus, and with a size of ~2570 bp harbouring two introns near 5&apos; and 3&apos; termini. Hereby, we report a new 18S rDNA gene arrangement in terms of intron localization and nucleotide sequence in a Dunaliella isolated from Iranian salt lakes (ABRIINW-M1/2). PCR amplification with genus-specific primers resulted in production of a ~2170 bp DNA band, which is similar to that of D. salina 18S rDNA gene containing only one intron near 5&apos; terminus. Whilst, sequence composition of the gene revealed the lack of any intron near 5&apos; terminus in our isolate. Furthermore, another alteration was observed due to the presence of a 440 bp DNA fragment near 3&apos; terminus. Accordingly, 18S rDNA gene of the isolate is clearly different from those of D. salina and any other Dunaliella species reported so far. Moreover, analysis of ITS region sequence showed the diversity of this region compared to the previously reported species. 18S rDNA and ITS sequences of our isolate were submitted with accesion numbers of EU678868 and EU927373 in NCBI database, respectively. The optimum growth rate of this isolate occured at the salinity level of 1 M NaCl. The maximum carotenoid content under stress condition of intense light (400μmol photon m -2 s -1 ), high salinity (4 M NaCl) and deficiency of nitrate and phosphate nutritions reached to 240 ng/cell after 15 days.

Bioinformatic evaluation showed that NAD–localized genes take part in specific biological processes, like the response to other organisms, odor perception, and tissue development. 3D FISH and immunofluorescence experiments illustrated the spatial distribution of NAD–specific chromatin within interphase nuclei and its alteration upon transcriptional changes. Altogether, our findings describe the nature of DNA sequences associated with the human nucleolus and provide insights into the function of the nucleolus in genome organization and establishment of nuclear architecture.

Science.gov (United States)       135    Genotyping of Human Lice Suggests Multiple Emergences of Body Lice from Local Head Louse Populations    Ortiz, Gabriel       Full Text Available.BackgroundGenetic analyses of human lice have shown that the current taxonomic classification of head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) and body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus) does not reflect their phylogenetic organization. Three phylotypes of head lice A, B and C exist but body lice have been observed only in phylotype A. Head and body lice have different behaviours and only the latter have been involved in outbreaks of infectious diseases including epidemic typhus, trench fever and louse borne recurrent fever. Recent studies suggest that body lice arose several times from head louse populations.Methods and FindingsBy introducing a new genotyping technique, sequencing variable intergenic spacer s which were selected from louse genomic sequence, we were able to evaluate the genotypic distribution of 207 human lice. Sequence variation of two intergenic spacer s, S2 and S5, discriminated the 207 lice into 148 genotypes and sequence variation of another two intergenic spacer s, PM1 and PM2, discriminated 174 lice into 77 genotypes. Concatenation of the four intergenic spacer s discriminated a panel of 97 lice into 96 genotypes. These intergenic spacer sequence types were relatively specific geographically, and enabled us to identify two clusters in France, one cluster in Central Africa (where a large body louse outbreak has been observed) and one cluster in Russia. Interestingly, head and body lice were not genetically differentiated.ConclusionsWe propose a hypothesis for the emergence of body lice, and suggest that humans with both low hygiene and head louse infestations provide an opportunity for head louse variants, able to ingest a larger blood meal (a required characteristic of body lice), to colonize clothing. If this hypothesis is ultimately supported, it would help to explain why poor human hygiene often coincides with outbreaks of body lice. Additionally, if head lice act as a reservoir for body lice, and that any social degradation in human populations may allow the formation of new populations of body lice, then head louse populations are potentially a greater threat to humans than previously assumed.

C.       The castor bean plant (Ricinus communis) is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae. In spite of its common name, the castor plant is not a true bean (i.e., leguminous plants belonging to the family, Fabaceae). Ricinus communis is native to tropical Africa, but because the plant was recognized for its production of oil with many desirable properties, it has been introduced and cultivated in warm temperate regions throughout the world (Armstrong 1999 and Brown 2005). Castor bean plants have also been valued by gardeners as an ornamental plant and, historically, as a natural rodenticide. Today, escaped plants grow like weeds throughout much of the southwestern United States, and castor seeds are even widely available to the public for order through the Internet. In this study, multiple loci of chloroplast noncoding sequence data and a few nuclear noncoding regions were examined to identify DNA polymorphisms present among representatives from a geographically diverse panel of Ricinus communis cultivated varieties. The primary objectives for this research were (1) to successfully cultivate castor plants and extract sufficient yields of high quality DNA from an assortment of castor cultivated varieties, (2) to use PCR and sequencing to screen available universal oligos against a small panel of castor cultivars, (3) to identify DNA polymorphisms within the amplified regions, and (4) to evaluate these DNA polymorphisms as appropriate candidates for assay development (see Figure 1). Additional goals were to design, test and optimize assays targeting any DNA polymorphisms that were discovered and to rapidly screen many castor cultivars to determine the amount of diversity present at that particular locus. Ultimately, the goal of this study was to construct a phylogeographic tree representing the genetic relationships present among Ricinus communis cultivars from diverse geographic regions. These research objectives were designed to test the hypothesis that cultivated varieties of Ricinus communis from various geographic regions can be distinguished from one another based on differences present at the genetic level. In addition, the present study sought to determine the amount of diversity present among Ricinus communis cultivars.

Ultimately, the goal of this study was to construct a phylogeographic tree representing the genetic relationships present among Ricinus communis cultivars from diverse geographic regions. These research objectives were designed to test the hypothesis that cultivated varieties of Ricinus communis from various geographic regions can be distinguished from one another based on differences present at the genetic level. In addition, the present study sought to determine the amount of diversity present among Ricinus communis cultivars.

Improvement of treatment efficacy and decreased side effects through tumor-targeted drug delivery would be desirable. By panning with a phage-displayed cyclic random peptide library we selected a peptide with strong affinity for RMS in vitro and in vivo. The peptide minimal binding motif Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)(Arg/Lys) identified by alanine-scan, suggested the target receptor to be a proprotein convertase (PC). Expression profiling of all PCs in RMS biopsies and cell lines revealed consistent high expression levels for the membrane-bound furin and PC7. Direct binding of RMS-P3 peptide to furin was demonstrated by affinity chromatography and supported by activity and colocalization studies. Treatment of RMS in mice with doxorubicin coupled to the targeting peptide resulted in a two-fold increase in therapeutic efficacy compared to doxorubicin treatment alone. Our findings indicate surface-furin binding as novel mechanism for therapeutic cell penetration which needs to be further investigated. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that specific targeting of membrane-bound furin in tumors is possible for and suggests that RMS and other tumors might benefit from proprotein convertases targeted drug delivery.

Full Text Available.In mid September 2008, clinical signs of bluetongue (particularly coronitis) were observed in cows on three different farms in eastern Netherlands (Luttenberg, Heeten, and Barchem), two of which had been vaccinated with an inactivated BTV-8 vaccine (during May-June 2008). Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection was also detected on a fourth farm (Oldenzaal) in the same area while testing for export. BTV RNA was subsequently identified by real time RT-PCR targeting genome-segment (Seg-) 10, in blood samples from each farm. The virus was isolated from the Heeten sample (IAH“dsRNA virus reference collection”[dsRNA-VRC]isolate number NET2008/05) and typed as BTV-6 by RT-PCR targeting Seg-2. Sequencing confirmed the virus type, showing an identical Seg-2 sequence to that of the South African BTV-6 live-vaccine-strain. Although most of the other genome segments also showed very high levels of identity to the BTV-6 vaccine (99.7 to 100%), Seg-10 showed greatest identity (98.4%) to the BTV-2 vaccine (RSAvvv2/02), indicating that NET2008/05 had acquired a different Seg-10 by reassortment. Although Seg-7 from NET2008/05 was also most closely related to the BTV-6 vaccine (99.7/100%nt/aa identity), the Seg-7 sequence derived from the blood sample of the same animal (NET2008/06) was identical to that of the Netherlands BTV-8 (NET2006/04 and NET2007/01). This indicates that the blood contained two different Seg-7 sequences, one of which (from the BTV-6 vaccine) was selected during virus isolation in cell-culture. The predominance of the BTV-8 Seg-7 in the blood sample suggests that the virus was in the process of reassorting with the northern field strain of BTV-8. Two genome segments of the virus showed significant differences from the BTV-6 vaccine, indicating that they had been acquired by reassortment event with BTV-8, and another unknown parental-strain. However, the route by which BTV-6 and BTV-8 entered northern Europe was not established.

Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)       147    Evolutionary expansion and divergence in a large family of primate-specific zinc finger transcription factor genes    Hamilton, A T Huntley, S       Although most genes are conserved as one-to-one orthologs in different mammalian orders, certain gene families have evolved to comprise different numbers and types of protein-coding genes through independent series of gene duplications, divergence and gene loss in each evolutionary lineage. One such family encodes KRAB-zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) genes, which are likely to function as transcriptional repressors. One KRAB-ZNF subfamily, the ZNF91 clade, has expanded specifically in primates to comprise more than 110 loci in the human genome, yielding large gene clusters in human chromosomes 19 and 7 and smaller clusters or isolated copies at other chromosomal locations. Although phylogenetic analysis indicates that many of these genes arose before the split between old world monkeys and new world monkeys, the ZNF91 subfamily has continued to expand and diversify throughout the evolution of apes and humans. The paralogous loci are distinguished by sequence divergence within their zinc finger arrays indicating a selection for proteins with different DNA binding specificities. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization data show that some of these ZNF genes can have tissue-specific expression patterns, however many KRAB-ZNFs that are near-ubiquitous could also be playing very specific roles in halting target pathways in all tissues except for a few, where the target is released by the absence of its repressor. The number of variant KRAB-ZNF proteins is increased not only because of the large number of loci, but also because many loci can produce multiple splice variants, which because of the modular structure of these genes may have separate and perhaps even conflicting regulatory roles. The lineage-specific duplication and rapid divergence of this family of transcription factor genes suggests a role in determining species-specific biological differences and the evolution of novel primate traits.

We investigated if these two groupsof closely related bacteria represent 32 strains fundamentally differingin lifestyle, or if they simply represent different stages of afacultative endosymbiotic lifestyle. The phylogenetic analysis of 16SrRNA gene and 16S34 23S ITS sequences of five endosymbiont strains fromtwo different Euplotes species and 40 pure culture strains demonstratedhost-species-specific clustering of the endosymbiont 36 sequences withinthe PnecC subcluster. The sequences of the endosymbionts showedcharacteristics indicating an obligate endosymbiotic lifestyle.Cultivation experiments 38 revealed fundamental differences inphysiological adaptations, and determination of the genome sizesindicated a slight size reduction in endosymbiotic strains. We concludethat the 40 two groups of PnecC bacteria represent obligately free-livingand obligately endosymbiotic strains, respectively, and do not representdifferent stages of the same complex lifecycle. 42 These closely relatedstrains occupy completely separated ecological niches. To our bestknowledge, this is the closest phylogenetic relationship between obligateendosymbionts and 44 obligately free-living bacteria everrevealed.

Background and methodology of a longitudinal study of clinical, parasitological and immunological parameters in Nangapanda, Flores, Indonesia (ImmunoSPIN Study)           Full Text Available.BackgroundGiven that helminth infections are thought to have strong immunomodulatory activity, the question whether helminth infections might affect responses to malaria antigens needs to be addressed. Different cross-sectional studies using diverse methodologies have reported that helminth infections might either exacerbate or reduce the severity of malaria attacks. The same discrepancies have been reported for parasitemia.Methods/DesignTo determine the effect of geohelminth infections and their treatment on malaria infection and disease outcome, as well as on immunological parameters, the area of Nangapanda on Flores Island, Indonesia, where malaria and helminth parasites are co-endemic was selected for a longitudinal study. Here a Double-blind randomized trial will be performed, incorporating repeated treatment with albendazole (400 mg) or placebo at three monthly intervals. Household characteristic data, anthropometry, the presence of intestinal helminth and Plasmodium spp infections, and the incidence of malaria episodes are recorded. In vitro cultures of whole blood, stimulated with a number of antigens, mitogens and toll like receptor ligands provide relevant immunological parameters at baseline and following 1 and 2 years of treatment rounds. The primary outcome of the study is the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infection. The secondary outcome will be incidence and severity of malaria episodes detected via both passive and active follow-up. The tertiary outcome is the inflammatory cytokine profile in response to parasite antigens. The project also facilitates the transfer of state of the art methodologies and technologies, molecular diagnosis of parasitic diseases, immunology and epidemiology from Europe to Indonesia.DiscussionThe study will provide data on the effect of helminth infections on malaria. It will also give information on anthelminthic treatment efficacy and effectiveness and could help develop evidence-based policymaking.Trial registrationThis study was approved by The Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, ref:194/PT02.FK/Etik/2006 and has been filed by ethics committee of the Leiden University Medical Center.

Because of the close phylogenetic distance to humans, pigs serve as a suitable model for studying e.g. intestinal development or disease. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are key regulators of intestinal development and their aberrant expression leads to intestinal malignancy.ResultsHere, we present the identification of hundreds of apparently novel miRNAs in the porcine intestine. MiRNAs were first identified by means of deep sequencing followed by miRNA precursor prediction using the miRDeep algorithm as well as searching for conserved miRNAs. Second, the porcine miRNAome along the entire intestine (duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum, ascending and transverse colon) was unraveled using customized miRNA microarrays based on the identified sequences as well as known porcine and human ones. In total, the expression of 332 intestinal miRNAs was discovered, of which 201 represented assumed novel porcine miRNAs. The identified hairpin forming precursors were in part organized in genomic clusters, and most of the precursors were located on chromosomes 3 and 1, respectively. Hierarchical clustering of the expression data revealed subsets of miRNAs that are specific to distinct parts of the intestine pointing to their impact on cellular signaling networks.ConclusionsIn this study, we have applied a straight forward approach to decipher the porcine intestinal miRNAome for the first time in mammals using a piglet model. The high number of identified novel miRNAs in the porcine intestine points out their crucial role in intestinal function as shown by pathway analysis. On the other hand, the reported miRNAs may share orthologs in other mammals such as human still to be discovered.

Dogs can be simultaneously or sequentially infected with multiple pathogens. Canine babesiosis caused by Babesia canis canis and Babesia canis vogeli is known to occur in Portugal. This study assessed, by means of blood smear examination, PCR and DNA nucleotide sequencing, the presence of Babesia spp. and co-infecting agents Leishmania, Anaplasma/Ehrlichia and Hepatozoon in 45 dogs from northern Portugal clinically suspected of babesiosis.ResultsForty-four dogs (98%) had infection with B. canis canis and one with B. canis vogeli. Co-infections were detected in nine animals (20%). Eight dogs were found infected with two vector-borne agents: six with B. canis canis and Leishmania infantum; one with B. canis canis and Ehrlichia canis; and one with B. canis canis and Hepatozoon canis. Another dog was infected with three vector-borne pathogens: B. canis vogeli, E. canis and L. infantum. Overall, L. infantum was found in seven (16%), E. canis in two (4%), and H. canis in one (2%) out of the 45 dogs with babesiosis. Almost 90% of the 45 cases of canine babesiosis were diagnosed in the colder months of October (18%), November (27%), December (20%), February (13%) and March (9%). Co-infections were detected in February, March, April, May, October and November. Twenty-two (50%) out of 44 dogs infected with B. canis were found infested by ticks including Dermacentor spp., Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Mortality (9%) included two co-infected dogs that died spontaneously and two with single infections that were euthanized.ConclusionsBabesia canis canis is the main etiological agent of canine babesiosis in northern Portugal. A higher sensitivity of Babesia spp. detection was obtained with PCR assays, compared to the observation of blood smears. Twenty percent of the dogs were co-infected with L. infantum, E. canis or H. canis. Furthermore, this is the first molecular identification of H. canis in dogs from northern Portugal.

The primary goal of the Biodiesel/Aquatic Species Project is to develop the technology for growing microalgae as a renewable biomass feedstock for the production of a diesel fuel substitute (biodiesel), thereby reducing the need for imported petroleum. Microalgae are of interest as a feedstock because of their high growth rates and tolerance to varying environmental conditions, and because the oils (lipids) they produce can be extracted and converted to substitute petroleum fuels such as biodiesel. Microalgae can be grown in arid and semi-arid regions with poor soil quality, and saline water from aquifers or the ocean can be used for growing microalgae. Biodiesel is an extremely attractive candidate to fulfill the need for a diesel fuel substitute. Biodiesel is a cleaner fuel than petroleum diesel; it is virtually free of sulfur, and emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulates during combustion are significantly reduced in comparison to emissions from petroleum diesel. Biodiesel provides essentially the same energy content and power output as petroleum-based diesel fuel.     Science.gov (United States)       164    A survey of canine filarial diseases of veterinary and public health significance in India           Full Text Available.BackgroundDirofilaria spp., Acanthocheilonema spp. and Brugia spp. have all been reported in Indian dogs. In previous studies, diagnosis was made by morphological identification only. This is the first geographically stratified cross-sectional study in India to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of canine filarial species of veterinary and public health importance, using a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic techniques.ResultsA total of 139 from 525 dogs (26.5%; 95% CI 22.7, 30.3) were positive for microfilariae. The most common species of canine filaria identified in this study was A. reconditum (9.3%) followed by D. repens (6.7%) and D. immitis (1.5%). Three out of 525 dogs were found to have mixed infections on PCR. The morphological and molecular evidence on the sequence of the 18S gene and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS-2 region provided strong evidence that the canine microfilariae discovered in the Himalayan city of Ladakh belong to a novel species of Acanthocheilonema. Two dogs in Ladakh were also found to have mixed infections of the novel species described above and a unique microfilaria which morphologically resembled Microfilaria auquieri Foley, 1921.ConclusionsAt least six species of filarial nematode are now known to infect dogs in India, two of which were reported for the first time in this study. The study also confirms and extends the geographical distribution of canine heartworm (D. immitis) which overlaps with D. repens, emphasising the importance for veterinary clinicians and diagnostic laboratories to utilise immunodiagnostic tests that will not cross-react between those two filarial species. From a public health viewpoint, the distribution and prevalences of these nematodes warrant an appropriate prophylaxis to be administered to dogs.

However, it remains unclear whether cis-regulatory elements of their target genes also exhibit common signatures associated with conserved embryonic fields. To address this question, we focused on genes that are active in the anterior neuroectoderm and non-neural ectoderm of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Following the dissection of a prototypic anterior placodal enhancer, we searched all genomic conserved non-coding elements for duplicated motifs around genes showing anterior neuroectodermal expression. Strikingly, we identified an over-represented pentamer motif corresponding to the binding site of the homeodomain protein OTX, which plays a pivotal role in the anterior development of all bilaterian species. Using an in vivo reporter gene assay, we observed that 10 of 23 candidate cis-regulatory elements containing duplicated OTX motifs are active in the anterior neuroectoderm, thus showing that this cis-regulatory signature is predictive of neuroectodermal enhancers. These results show that a common cis-regulatory signature corresponding to K50-Paired homeodomain transcription factors is found in non-coding sequences flanking anterior neuroectodermal genes in chordate embryos. Thus, field-specific selector genes impose architectural constraints in the form of combinations of short tags on their target enhancers. This could account for the strong evolutionary conservation of the regulatory elements controlling field-specific selector genes responsible for body plan formation.

Here, we report that rpS5 plays an additional local role at the head/platform interface in efficient SSU maturation. We find that yeast small ribosomal subunits which incorporated an rpS5 variant lacking the seven C-terminal amino acids have a largely assembled head domain and are exported to the cytoplasm. On the other hand, 3′processing of 18S rRNA precursors is inhibited in these ribosomal particles, although they associate with the putative endonuclease Nob1p and other late acting 40S biogenesis factors. We suggest that the SSU head component rpS5 and platform components as rpS14 are crucial constituents of a highly defined spatial arrangement in the head–platform interface of nascent SSUs, which is required for efficient processing of the therein predicted SSU rRNA 3′end. Positioning of rpS5 in nascent SSUs, including its relative orientation towards platform components in the head-platform cleft, will depend on the general assembly and folding state of the head domain. Therefore, the suggested model can explain 18S precursor rRNA 3′processing phenotypes observed in many eukaryotic SSU head assembly mutants.     Scientific Electronic Library Online (Colombia)       170    A Comparison of the First Two Sequenced Chloroplast Genomes in Asteraceae: Lettuce and Sunflower    Timme, Ruth E. Kuehl, Jennifer V.       Asteraceae is the second largest family of plants, with over 20,000 species. For the past few decades, numerous phylogenetic studies have contributed to our understanding of the evolutionary relationships within this family, including comparisons of the fast evolving chloroplast gene, ndhF, rbcL, as well as non-coding DNA from the trnL intron plus the trnLtrnF intergenic spacer , matK, and, with lesser resolution, psbA-trnH. This culminated in a study by Panero and Funk in 2002 that used over 13,000 bp per taxon for the largest taxonomic revision of Asteraceae in over a hundred years. Still, some uncertainties remain, and it would be very useful to have more information on the relative rates of sequence evolution among various genes and on genome structure as a potential set of phylogenetic characters to help guide future phylogenetic structures. By way of contributing to this, we report the first two complete chloroplast genome sequences from members of the Asteraceae, those of Helianthus annuus and Lactuca sativa. These plants belong to two distantly related subfamilies, Asteroideae and Cichorioideae, respectively. In addition to these, there is only one other published chloroplast genome sequence for any plant within the larger group called Eusterids II, that of Panax ginseng (Araliaceae, 156,318 bps, AY582139). Early chloroplast genome mapping studies demonstrated that H. annuus and L. sativa share a 22 kb inversion relative to members of the subfamily Barnadesioideae. By comparison to outgroups, this inversion was shown to be derived, indicating that the Asteroideae and Cichorioideae are more closely related than either is to the Barnadesioideae. Later sequencing study found that taxa that share this 22 kb inversion also contain within this region a second, smaller, 3.3 kb inversion. These sequences also enable an analysis of patterns of shared repeats in the genomes at fine level and of RNA editing by comparison to available EST sequences. In addition, since both of these genomes are crop plants, their complete genome sequence will facilitate development of chloroplast genetic engineering technology, as in recent studies from Daniells lab. Knowing the exact sequence from spacer regions is crucial for introducing transgenes into the chloroplast genome.     Science.gov (United States)       171    A Comparison of the First Two Sequenced Chloroplast Genomes in Asteraceae: Lettuce and Sunflower    Timme, Ruth E.; Kuehl, Jennifer V.; Boore, Jeffrey L.; Jansen, Robert K.   2006-01-20    Asteraceae is the second largest family of plants, with over 20,000 species. For the past few decades, numerous phylogenetic studies have contributed to our understanding of the evolutionary relationships within this family, including comparisons of the fast evolving chloroplast gene, ndhF, rbcL, as well as non-coding DNA from the trnL intron plus the trnLtrnF intergenic spacer , matK, and, with lesser resolution, psbA-trnH. This culminated in a study by Panero and Funk in 2002 that used over 13,000 bp per taxon for the largest taxonomic revision of Asteraceae in over a hundred years. Still, some uncertainties remain, and it would be very useful to have more information on the relative rates of sequence evolution among various genes and on genome structure as a potential set of phylogenetic characters to help guide future phylogenetic structures. By way of contributing to this, we report the first two complete chloroplast genome sequences from members of the Asteraceae, those of Helianthus annuus and Lactuca sativa. These plants belong to two distantly related subfamilies, Asteroideae and Cichorioideae, respectively. In addition to these, there is only one other published chloroplast genome sequence for any plant within the larger group called Eusterids II, that of Panax ginseng (Araliaceae, 156,318 bps, AY582139).

			<title>MoreLife: More Dietary Ideas from Our Diet Regimen</title>
			<body>
				 More Dietary Ideas from Our Diet Regimen    Breakfast * Main Meal * Desert/Snack   Overall Diet Regimen     Breakfast (Breakfast Meals)       Using buckwheat has been an education.    Six flavonoids isolated and identified in buckwheat are rutin, orientin, vitexin, quercetin, isovitexin, and isoorientin. Rutin and isovitexin are the only flavonoid components of buckwheat seeds while hulls contain all six identified compounds.  R     Most unground buckwheat that is available for purchase in health food stores is hulled. That is, the black hulls have been milled away from the &quot;berries&quot; leaving a light cream colored kernel, referred to as groats. When the groats have been roasted (toasted) they take on a pale reddish-brown color and are often called kasha.       Of significant importance is that experiments, both with animal models and with human beings, have revealed that buckwheat flour can improve diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and constipation.  R  (And the flour is from the unhulled &quot;berries&quot; which gives it that easily recognized beige with black flecks appearance.) Additionally, buckwheat has the great advantage of giving one the &quot;full&quot; feeling sooner than wheat.  R  Even before reading about the high satiety level of buckwheat, Kitty had noticed that she could never finish my hot cereal with buckwheat, but often had no difficulty with all the same ingredients, except the buckwheat, uncooked in just milk or even added to yogurt or kefir. However, buckwheat has trypsin inhibitors that can cause poor digestion if not sufficiently cooked  R  . Therefore buckwheat is now only used in cooked form.     Following the only recipe Kitty could find online using whole buckwheat, she first tried soaking a half cup of whole buckwheat for a couple hours and then gently boiled them to for use in a porridge as she had successfully done for many months with groats. Unfortunately, the hulls did not appreciably soften and the cereal was too chewy for her taste. (When re-examining the recipe - actually for bread - Kitty saw from the photographs that the buckwheat used was *not* unhulled but rather simply groats.)      Paul suggested that since we use our coffee mill to grind flax and sesame seeds, why not try doing the same for the buckwheat. The hulls are cut up fairly well with the blade and the flour produced is used in making a porridge with Kitty&apos;s morning powders. Since the Spring of 2005 we have used whole ground buckwheat in pancakes and even muffins - see below for a super pancake recipe.   With 25 pounds of buckwheat though, we needed to find some more ways of using it and can now see that using it up will not take &quot;forever&quot;. Paul acknowledged after the bag arrived by UPS that he didn&apos;t realize how large a volume it would be. But the containers are tightly sealed and being kept in dark dry locations in both Arizona and Ontario. The first source of our unhulled buckwheat - Bob&apos;s Red Mill - stopped showing unhulled buckwheat on their website as of December 2005. Kitty investigated other websites and we purchased from Paul&apos;s Grains . A look at their Whole Grains price list shows a lower price than our original purchase. We were very pleased with the service and shipment and having been using the Paul&apos;s Grains unhulled buckwheat since November 2007. When we run out of the unhulled buckwheat (that we take north with us) in Ontario, we substitute whole buckwheat flour, obtainable in Bancroft healthfood stores.    When we had only buckwheat groats available, Kitty cooked a scant 1/4 C for a few minutes in water and then added it to her other powders/nuts/prunes which had been cooked in the microwave as described for her Breakfast. The buckwheat has a really nice aroma when cooking and tastes good too, with a pleasurable chewiness to it. However, be warned that toasted buckwheat groats (kasha) do *not* cook up well for this purpose and do not even taste good (IMO) in this application. (We are using up the supply of toasted groats in soups.)         Adding hemp seed to our breakfasts.  During the summer of 2004, we came across a few references to the beneficial essential fatty acid content and high protein levels of hemp seed. While the USDA completely ignores this politically incorrect food seed (there is currently no entry in their database), there are a few sources of nutritional information online. ( Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest , to name just two.) The limited amount of detailed scientific information online about this nutritional seed is a tragic loss regarding what was for many years a major product in North America and extends far back in Asian use.  R    Since the Fall 2004 we have replaced the toasted hemp seed with the extrusions (seed cake) from the first pressing of fresh hemp seeds. This was originally obtained from Hempola and which sold it primarily as animal snacks, but we found them to be an interesting nutty flavor enjoyed plain, with dried fruit (especially prunes by Kitty) and in Paul&apos;s smoothie. Since Spring of 2005 Kitty has included them also in her breakfast (hot or cold), grinding them up with the flax, sesame seeds and whole buckwheat for cooked cereal. She simply breaks the extrusions into small pieces for inclusion in her muesli, which adds to the pleasant crunchiness of that cereal.  When we were close to exhausting our supply in the summer of 2006, Kitty contacted Hempola to verify availability and was told that they now use all their extrusions for sifting to flour and protein powder. She received the same message when contacting several other hemp companies in Canada. She had almost given up getting the hemp extrusions (and we&apos;d meanwhile run out), when she happened to find reference to seed cake available in bulk from a supplier she&apos;d not yet contacted. We now have another large amount and can continue to enjoy this nutritionally valuable food - see thread at MoreLife Yahoo . (Kitty also uses it in homemade trailmix - very nice!).  Shelled hemp seeds can substitute for broken hemp extrusions in cereals, but lack the nice crunch; Hemp Hearts is a brand we have seen in Bancroft healthfood stores. However, the shelled hemp seed contains only alpha linolenic acid, the poorer form of omega-3, and therefore should not be considered a &quot;wonder food&quot;, despite its often high hype marketing. Hemp flour, which is becoming more available in many locations, would work well where we have used ground extrusions.       Super Nutritious Blueberry Pancakes featuring Whole Ground Buckwheat and Hemp (with Pumpkin Puree too)  Dry Ingredients:   1C rye flour  4T soy protein powder  1t ground ginger  2t ground cinnamon  3T baking powder  3/4C whey powder  Items to be ground (coffee mill works great):  4T whole flax  2T sesame seeds (unhulled)  1/3C whole buckwheat  1/3C hemp extrusions (as described above )  1/3C Lecithin  2T each of almonds and filberts (hazelnuts) - walnuts and brazilnuts are good too    Buckwheat and hemp flours can be substituted for the whole and extrusions listed above. Mix all dry ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl mix:   2 eggs  2T olive oil (extra virgin)  1 1/2C sour milk (if we have none that has soured, we use ~ 3/4 of total fresh and the remainder kefir or yogurt)  Highly Recommended OPTION: Replace half of milk with equal amount of cooked pumpkin puree.   Add to liquid:   1/2C currants (black are best)  Let currants soak a bit and then stir liquid into mixed dry ingredients adding more milk if needed, though batter should be thick. Add with last of mixing: 1C blueberries (fresh or frozen)   Add a bit more milk if batter is overly thick. The quantity of ingredients above are never exactly the same every time we make these delicious pancakes. We&apos;ve not found that being exact is a necessity.     Fry in a good fat (we use chicken fat when we&apos;ve cooked chicken recently - the reasons why are discussed in a MoreLife Yahoo post and oil olive other times) over moderate heat until bubbles appear and just begin to break. Flip over and fry other side - color should be only moderately brown. We have decided that the addition of cooked pumpkin is now a permanent item for us. It - and maybe the kefir too - make the pancakes fluffier and more moist. They were good before, but now they&apos;re just scrumptious! Great toppings are buckwheat honey and *more* blueberries or any fresh fruit. Peanut butter spread over the pancakes topped with slices of banana is one of Kitty&apos;s favorite, but so is yogurt. We also have used no sugar added strawberry or guava pulp purchased under the brand F-Diaz. All of these are just yummy ;&gt;) This recipe makes enough for two full breakfasts for both of us - 10 ~5&quot; diameter pancakes. We freeze the second five between separate sheets of wax paper and in a ziplock plastic bag, putting them in the toaster oven the next time. Still yummy! We have also taken these pancakes on our drive between Ontario and Arizona for snacking - right from the freezer and into our coldbox. They&apos;re very good tasting, even when a microwave is not available to warm them, accompanied by hot coffee, tea or coffee-cocoa combo. Our plans to try a muffin variation of this recipe took place in mid-August 2006... below      Super Nutritious Blueberry Muffins     Use ingredients for pancakes above with following addition:   2T blackstrap molasses (better nutritionally than regular)  2T barley malt extract (in better baking stores and where beer making supplies sold)   Dilute the thick molasses and (especially) barley malt in approximately 1/4 C of warm water. Add this to a reduced amount of milk - about 3/4 C.  Add additional milk if needed, keeping the batter a cake-like consistency. Pour into greased muffin pan, about 2/3 full.  Bake at 350F for 20 minutes or until muffins pull away from sides and toothpick inserted into near center of a muffin is clean. Remove from pan immediately. Eat cooled or warm plain or with small amount of butter, jam, preserves, etc.     These muffins freeze very well, which is what we did with the 15 remaining after a couple days when we made this recipe the first time in mid-August 2006.     Super Nutritious Pumpkin Cranberry Muffins  Use ingredients for pancakes above with following modifications:  Add to the dry ingredients: 3/4 t allspice  3/4 t nutmeg   Add to liquid ingredients: 1 1/4 C pumpkin puree  3/4 C cranberries (frozen or fresh) cut into small pieces  2T barley malt extract (in better baking stores and where beer making supplies sold)   Reduce milk to approximately 1C and eliminate blueberries and currants. Dilute the barley malt in some of the milk, warmed slightly. Batter should be cake-like in consistency. Pour into greased muffin pan, about 3/4 full.  Bake at 350F for 20 minutes or until muffins pull away from sides and toothpick inserted into near center of a muffin is clean. Remove from pan immediately. These are great warm and plain on a cold day or with small amount of butter, jam, preserves, etc. This recipe made 21 nice size muffins, 12 of which we froze. 8 made it to a tight tin after cooling - we ate one while it was still hot. Definitely yummy and more moist than the blueberry version.  The pumpkin we used was approximately 5 lbs, one being given away - &quot;free to good home&quot;, read the sign in one of the health food stores in Bancroft that we frequent. It was not one of the typical Jack-&apos;o-Lantern varieties, bright orange. Instead it was a reddish orange with a slightly rough skin. We scrubbed the skin, cut it in half, scooped out all the seeds and pulp (reserved for Paul&apos;s smoothies, 2/3 stored in the freezer) and then cut into quarters. They were baked in the old faithful baking pan, with a very small amount of water, at 300F for approximately 1 hour - until a fork pierced the skin easily. Once the pumpkin was cool enough to handle, large spoonfuls were scraped from the skin and pureed in our blender. We tasted as we pureed it; finding it *very* good, we decided to reserve one of the 1/4&apos;s for use as a vegetable.       Mighty Muesli  Dry Ingredients (volume amounts are approximate):   1C each of rye, oats, barley and spelt flakes (gram weights: 88, 94, 135, 95)  1 C raisins (155 grams)  2 dried apricots, cut into small pieces (22 grams)  3 dried figs, cut into small pieces (34 grams)  1C pumpkin seeds (135 grams)  1/3C each of filberts, almonds, brazil nuts, and walnuts (gram weights: 39, 50, 50, 36), cut into slivers or small pieces  1/2C hemp extrusions (76 grams), broken into small pieces  1/4C raw cacao nibs (30 grams)      Kitty uses a serving size of 2 large (there are 2 sizes) LEF whey scoops, which weighs approximately 80grams. The total amount above provides approximately 14 servings of this size. Those without easy access to hemp extrusions may want to try shelled hemp seeds, but because the fiber has been removed Kitty finds them a mediocre substitute.        Meal Main Course (Our Main Meal Course Itself)      Update 5/15/10 Economizing on Meat Selections  While we live on a limited income we have found that purchasing good protein sources, which is important, can be done without sacrificing pleasure. The recipe ideas on our regimen page show that we get plenty of visually appealing main meals - and we assure readers that they taste as good as they look. We rarely buy beef for home meals because it is much higher in price than pork or chicken and also because, on a regular basis, we prefer the taste of these lesser priced meats. When we lived in Toronto, the local Dominion chain grocery store regularly marked down its meats each weekday morning when the precut packages are generally 2 days from labeled expiration.  We often took advantage of these reduced prices, generally on pork but sometimes when we were in the mood for beef liver or kidney. Now that we are living full-time in the summers at our cottage in rural Ontario, our purchase of pork, poultry and fish is what is available in nearby Wilberforce or further off Bancroft. Previously in Toronto, much of the chicken we ate was free-range, first experienced in early November 2001, and enjoyed it immensely. See Kitty&apos;s post on LEF Forums. We would buy whole legs (our favorite cut) from Max the Butcher on Baldwin in Toronto&apos;s Kensington Market, or at the city&apos;s only Whole Foods , a high end supermarket chain in Canada and the US.  Surprisingly, the price we were paying was comparable with the Dominion grocery store&apos;s ordinary chicken, except when on sale. However, we considered it a wise use of our money to frequently purchase the free-range and forgo the cheaper option. (However, we usually waited until the Dominion marked down their turkey thighs before making the rare purchases of these.) Here&apos;s a link to directory for the US and Canada of grass-fed animal products including chickens. Where we are located now in Ontario south of Algonquin Provincial Park, we have not seen free-range chicken marketed, but are on the look-out.    Salmon purchases, when we lived in Toronto, were almost exclusively at the fish markets in Kensington Market. By the time we moved, we were using the third shop since we started; while all have been operated by Portuguese and charge relatively similar prices, this one was cleaner and had some more knowledgeable staff. Sometimes, in order to be more assured of the feed quality being fed the farmed salmon that we were eating, we alternated our Kensington Market purchases with ones of Atlantic farmed salmon at Whole Foods, though the price is $4/lb more for steaks than what we payed for fillets at the fish markets. This grocery chain has its own aquaculture facility off Massachusetts and from what we read, puts great emphasis on quality. The local Dominion grocery chain had a fresh fish section which we also used when the Whole Foods price was just too much to bear. When we first moved to the cottage in late May 2005, we made use of the frozen salmon available in the local supermarkets. Unfortunately the first purchase turned out to be skinned (we didn&apos;t see this mentioned on the opaque bag), so we won&apos;t use that item again. In mid-summer we noticed that a meat store at the north end of Bancroft also carries fresh fish and seafood, and freezes large quantities of it also. We purchased fresh salmon fillets there several times until October (when we left for Arizona), of the same quality and only modestly higher in price than what we paid at the fish stores in Toronto. This experience showed us that it pays to look around a new area - and on foot rather than just while driving - to determine or improve full food purchasing. In the interim though, we ate more sardines. Unfortunately, in the summer of 2006, the owner/manager of this store switched to carrying only skinless salmon. Her reason, when Kitty asked, was that &quot;it moves faster&quot;. Kitty&apos;s reply was that it was only because so many people do not realize that the value is in the fat just under the skin, removed when sold skinless. So until Fall of 2007 our salmon while in Ontario was mainly canned.  Since Fall 2007, our salmon purchases in both Arizona and Ontario are of wild pacific variety, frozen as a half fish fillet (with skin still on it). In the Bancroft Food Chopper, frozen filleted halves of wild chum salmon selling for about $12/kg ($5.40/lb). Paul cuts the frozen whole in half and each one is cooked on a separate occasion yielding 3 meals for both of us. This has been a very good buy, one we hope to have available to us for a long time. In Arizona we purchase salmon this same way in Lee Lee&apos;s Oriental SuperMart in Chandler for about the same price as in rural Ontario - a better buy on a regular basis than in any other supermarket currently. Ideas for salmon main meals   Another inexpensive way to get most of the nutritional value of salmon is in the can. We often keep a can of it on hand for those times when we&apos;ve been unable to purchase any fresh and don&apos;t want to eat sardines or mackerel. See meal ideas for canned salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel.  Lastly, we began to economize even more on meat in 2009 by just eating less of it, specifically for the purpose of ingesting less methionine . Legumes, which are lower in methionine than most meat and fish make up more of our diet than prior to late 2009.        Updated 5/14/10 Vegetables - Nutritious doesn&apos;t mean without flavor  We purchase fresh vegetables and fruit (except for frozen mixed berries and blueberries used in Paul&apos;s smoothie) all year round, doing so when we lived in Toronto at the produce stands on Bloor Avenue between Spadina and Bathurst or more often at Kensington Market west of Spadina south of College. There were numerous produce vendors at this large market on the edge of Toronto&apos;s Chinatown, and many more scattered through this large oriental section itself. There is considerable variation in selection, price and quality from one produce market to another and we make the rounds, also purchasing dried fruits, nuts, cheese, salmon, kefir, teas, eggs and spices at other shops while there. (There are 5 fish stores alone in 1 block and 3 cheese stores in another.) One produce vendor we do not recommend is located at the SW corner of Baldwin and Kensington Ave; the owner has a practice of frequently not marking prices on the bins but worse, has been known to change his price when a person takes a marked item to the cash register. Interestingly, the owner of this particular produce market does not have a name on his building - the only one in Kensington Market that is anonymous to our knowledge. (See MoreLife Yahoo post for a description of &quot;The Cantaloupe Incident&quot; and a positive experience regarding brazil nuts at Mexican Dry Food, just a few doors further west on Baldwin in Kensington Market.)  Since moving to our cottage at the end of May 2005 for full-time residence when in Canada, our shopping has been limited to what is available in the nearby small town of Wilberforce or a bit further in Bancroft. The selection is not as varied as we had in Toronto and the price per lb (or kg) is typically more, but the nutritional value and taste has not suffered. And since our other expenses are much less (there is no mortgage), the somewhat higher food expense is easily offset. Even in a small town grocery store, fresh fruits and vegetables are available all year round. And yearly starting in July, the local Ontario farmers make fruits (including berries) and vegetables available in roadside stands and weekly markets. We look forward to these - especially the delicious Ontario strawberries. To supplement the selection, we do make use of frozen peas and beans, the former rarely available fresh and the latter very expensive or not fresh except in the middle of the summer.  When in Arizona, we make ourselves aware of the supermarket specials on fresh vegetables and fruit, and we can always get some that are acceptable though typically not with as wide a selection as was available in Toronto and often not as economically. Prior to 2008 we found the prices in Food City (an Hispanic targeted chain in Arizona owned by Basha&apos;s) the lowest, the produce quite good though not as varied as in some other chains. Since then, however, we have made weekly drives to the Phoenix area (on Wednesday to correspond with our dancing) to shop in Sprouts and Sunflower Markets , which have a large selection at reasonable prices, and also in Lee Lee&apos;s Oriental SuperMart , which has a wide selection of oriental greens and unusual (to us) Asian vegetable along with more the traditional items at very reasonable prices. (Typically our stop at Trader Joe&apos;s does not include vegetables.) Our use of canned vegetables is limited to sauerkraut and tomatoes, although we also eat cabbage and tomatoes raw and use both in cooking too.  Two vegetable items that we make use of when in Arizona (because they are much cheaper there) and found to be very tasty are tomatillos (green tomato-like; USDA report on raw only ) and nopalitos (young prickly pear cactus pieces; USDA report on raw only ).  Raw vegetables, whether mixed as a salad or eaten singly like appetizers, are enhanced with a nutritious salad dressing that can be easily made at home .      Cooking Collards and Kales     We have finally found a way to prepare kale and collard greens (which are among the most economical cooking greens) so that we find them palatable and enjoy eating them with some regularity.     A bunch of either is always enough for 2 meals, and often more.   Even so, to save time overall, Kitty cooks all of the bunch after washing thoroughly. (Initially she only cooked half the collards at a time, but found that occasionally she forgot about them and parts of leaves started to yellow.)            Bacon, which is kept frozen primarily for this purpose, is chopped small - about 1/2 slice, at most, is sufficient for fat and taste. (However, using only olive oil produces a quite acceptable vegetarian version.) About 1/3 to 1/2 cup of chopped onion is also used.     The chopped bacon gets the heat first until moderately well done and the onion is then given a head start before the stems. Once the stems have been added, this is the point at which I add several shakes of ground cumin (occasionally I forget but it can be added later too). Approximately 1/2 cup of water is added to the pot and brought to boil; then reduce heat to medium low, cover and cook 5 to 10 minutes - enough time to cut up the leaves.        The leaves are cut into short thin strips, by first cutting a stack of leaves length-wise and then cross-wise.         The leaves are stirred into the sauteed stems, so as to thoroughly mix. Adding another ~1/4 to 1/2 C of water may be necessary to ensure that there is sufficient liquid for cooking. The heat is adjusted so that the mixture gently boils.      More water may be needed, as these greens need a fair amount of water rather than to simply be steamed as is sufficient for the brief cooking of spinach. Stirring the mixture periodically is necessary to get the leaves fully wet and to distribute the onions and bacon. Adding more cumin to taste (or initially here if forgotten earlier) can be done at this point.    Initially we found that actually tasting the greens was necessary to determine if the leaves were properly tender, but going by the much darkened color and general very wilted appearance is enough now. A time of about 20 minutes of simmering (with occasional stirring) after adding the chopped leaves is sufficient.  A variation on the above method of seasoning for collards and kale is sauteing the onions along with a generous amount of fresh minced garlic in olive oil. Instead of cumin, ginger (1/4 to 1/2 tsp depending on the amount of greens) is used and the flavor is noticeably different and delicious. We don&apos;t know which we version we like better. At this point we just &quot;trade off&quot; now and then and have even most recently tried adding a bit of apple cider vinegar to already cooked collards and found it very tasty. Both the collards and kale taste quite good this way, and we have used the remaining liquid as the base of old and newly devised bean-vegetable soups . We can now have the advantage of the higher carotenoid content of kale and collard greens (compared to everything else but spinach) without gritting our teeth as we eat them. No longer do we avoid those greens - usually less expensive per meal than spinach - in the markets or produce section of the grocery stores.  A great way to use collards or kale as part of a main dish is to add some of it cooked as above to bean stew or simply mix with a generous amount of cottage cheese. Both are delicious.   Fresh lemon is squeezed over many of our vegetables as well as fish. Kitty likes some vegetables, such as beets, plain while Paul enjoys them, especially beets, with a tiny amount of butter. (Fresh beets bought with their tops are unique in that all parts - root, stems, and leaves are delicious.  Bring to boil, then simmer beets themselves unpeeled and whole till fork pierces easily; usually about 1 hour for medium sized though large ones can take up to two hours from our experience. Stems need a few minutes extra simmering before adding chopped leaves; cook till tender.  These last are great with lemon juice.)    Updated 5/13/10   Two delicious side vegetable dishes that we have been using fairly regularly, are ones we found in oriental markets. The first is kimchee (or kimchi), a Korean fermented dish usually of cabbage and radish, has been increasingly available in both Arizona and Toronto. It was in the latter that we first tried it and found it to be very good. We now have regular supply of several brands in the 2 large oriental markets known to us in the greater Phoenix area - Ranch 99 and Lee Lee&apos;s Supermart , a huge international market with an amazing selection.   We have found by experimentation that using half red kimchee, made with peppers and is spicy, with 1/2 plain (white) and then mixed with an equal quantity of Kitty&apos;s prepared cooked tomato, green peppers and zucchini is just delicious! We don&apos;t know what Koreans would have to say about the bastardization of their national fermented vegetable dish, but we love it. It is a slightly spicy alternative to ketchup which is almost always found to include sugar ( Lots more on kimchee ) In Spring 2009 we started using our blender for combining the red and white kimchees, taking a combined 32 oz jar with us to the cottage for the summer.    The second item, pickled mustard greens , we happened to come across in Lee Lee&apos;s SuperMart just by chance in Spring 2008. It comes in 13 oz clear plastic bags and was so cheap at $0.49 (up to $0.69 in Spring 2010) that we just had to try some. We were delighted that it tastes so good - Paul thinks even better than the kimchee/tomato combination. Goodbye to pickles (cucumbers) and hello to pickled mustard greens! In Fall 2009 we realized (after our experience with the kimchee above) that we could save time from cutting these coarsely by hand with scissors by using the blender. We empty 3 bags at a time into our 64oz blender (one of the 2 brands for sale is &quot;Double Horse Brand&quot;, but both look and say the same in English), cutting the pieces up a bit first (reserving the water for salad dressing making ) and chop finely. The chopped mustard greens store well in the refrigerator, though we go through a 32 oz container in little over a month! Using the blender this way produces a great consistency for applying the pickled mustard greens on top of items. Our favorite is on cheddar cheese - a great taste combination! And though it sounds strange, we also find a great taste combination to be rye bread spread with peanut butter, topped with slices of sharp cheddar cheese and then topped with the ground pickled mustard greens - super!  BTW, we have shared the blenderized combined kimchees and the blenderized pickled mustard greens with the owner of Lee Lee&apos;s. She told us they were great! Maybe we&apos;ll see them both for sale there this way in the future :&gt;)          Vegetable cooking waters have been added in the past to our &quot; meal cocktail &quot; which we use to swallow our pills. However, more recently, we&apos;ve been reusing the vegetable water, refrigerating it in-between uses. We add additional water if necessary when cooking a larger amount of broccoli at &quot;low&quot; heat (~70C). Occasionally we will use some of this vegetable &quot;stock&quot; for the meat or fish cooking. We modified our cooking of broccoli back in 2005 based on press release of a conference report at the American Chemical Society in March 2003. The study was published in May 2004.  R   This method of cooking broccoli requires close watching to keep the heat low and we sometimes got distracted. Therefore we obtained a triple pot set in the Fall of 2006 which includes steaming as one of its purposes. We were pleased to learn later that the moderately firm and still green steamed broccoli that we obtain this way is keeping the amount of the anticarcinogen sulforaphane very high. More recent studies than done in 2004 has resulted in slightly higher temperature cooking being best . &quot;As scientists, we learned that sulforaphane is maximized when broccoli has been heated 10 minutes at 140 degrees Fahrenheit,&quot; said Jeffery. &quot;For the consumer, who cannot readily hold the temperature as low as 140 degrees, that means the best way to prepare broccoli is to steam it lightly about 3 or 4 minutes--until the broccoli is tough-tender.&quot; Steaming as we do &quot;heat[s] the broccoli just enough to destroy the sulfur-grabbing protein, but not enough to harm the enzyme that releases sulforaphane from the sugar.&quot;      Cooking Spaghetti Squash  Instead of using pasta, wheat-based or other grains, the spaghetti squash is a wonderful alternative under a good marinara (tomato based sauce - always used because of its great source of lycopene). A squash of about 2 pounds is sufficient for Paul and me for 1 meal each plus leftovers.     After scrubbing the outside of the squash with a vegetable brush under running water, the skin is pierced with a long tinged fork in 3 locations around the middle.     For microwave baking it is placed in a shallow dish with about 1/2 inch of water. 15 to 20 minutes at 100% turning every 5 to 7 is usually sufficient. (Baking in regular oven works very well when done in a covered roasting pan at 350F for ~20 to 30 min or till &quot;done&quot;, again with about 1/2 inch of water in the pan. We&apos;ve done this when 2 or more spaghetti squashes are needed for a larger group of people.)     Testing for doneness - the outside of the squash should be soft and yield to press of finger.        Cut the stem off the end of the spaghetti squash and then cut again lengthwise to open the squash fully. Kitty does this while the squash is still quite hot and gloves are often needed to handle it comfortably.        The seeds in the center of the squash are removed using the tines of a fork so as to retain the squash pulp itself. These are set aside in Paul&apos;s smoothie &quot;refuse&quot; container and used with his next making. (When we cook multiple squashes, some of the seeds go into the freezer for future smoothies.)     The inner part of the squash (pulp) is &quot;forked&quot; out in strings which give it that &quot;spaghetti&quot; appearance for which it gets its name.        Grated parmesan cheese is generously sprinkled over the still quite hot squash. It can be eaten like this as a side dish. In fact some people simply fork-up the squash &quot;in the shell&quot;, after the seeds are removed, and serve as-is with lots of cheese.     We like our spaghetti squash (after sprinkling with parmesan cheese) under a generous amount of nutritious sauce - tomato based for lots of lycopene.       Mouthwatering Sweet Potatoes (&quot;Yam&quot;)  Paul and Kitty agree that the most delicious way to eat sweet potato (also marketed as yam, but there is a difference . USDA nutrient breakdown comparison can be made also.) is baked. And when it&apos;s done right no butter or sugar or marshmallows are needed - it will be sweet on it&apos;s own.        This sweet potato whole at left exceeds the 400g limit of our scale (0.88lb). The two quarters totaling 209g, weighed approximately 100 and 109 grams, respectively left to right on the scale. Paul&apos;s is of course the larger of the two ;&gt;) at this particular meal; the serving sizes have since early Spring 2005 been even smaller - ranging between 40 and 80grams.     The individual servings, packaged up neatly in aluminum foil are baked this time in the toaster oven set at 350F. When we oven roast a whole meal in a roasting pan we do so slowly at typically about 250F and put the same aluminum foil wrapped sweet potatoes outside the pan or place unwrapped pieces in with the meat.     When the sweet potato (&quot;yam&quot;)is felt through the aluminum foil to be soft, it is done. The unwrapped piece can be seen to be moist. The &quot;syrup&quot; that is exuded, some of which left on the inside of the foil, is just delicious. We pour off what collects in the foil onto the food and then wipe the foil clean directly with finger (or tongue :&gt;) for a delicious pre-meal treat. We heartily recommend eating sweet potatoes this way; anyone truly wanting to keep their calorie intake low will agree that adding sugar items actually masks the natural sweetness of this vegetable.                                       Comments on Cooking Temperatures  It is difficult not to wax longingly for a moment at the aroma of broiling steaks or other typical meats coming from backyards or restaurants in the warm months.  In years past Kitty would have readily prepared such a weekend dinner or ordered one of the Grill offerings from a menu.   However, over the past two years she has learned, as Paul (Tom) had done earlier, that numerous studies have linked high temperature cooking of meats to the production of heterocyclic  amines (HAs or HCAs)  R 1  , R 2  , R 3 pp1846-1847   and polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs)  R 1  , R 2  , R 3 pp1846-1847   , which have been shown to be carcinogenic to the target organs in animal models  R 1  , R 2  , R 3   and linked epidemiologically to various human cancers  R 1  , R 2  , R 3   . All of these substances - and more recently, acrylamides  R 1  , R 2  , R 3   and AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-Products)  R  - continue to be subjects of numerous studies to identify predisposing factors in various human populations and methods by which to reduce mutagenicity and other harmful effects of various food preparation methods.  For now, we consider it less risky to keep our dietary intake of these substances as low as possible. Therefore, we rarely eat US-style bacon (highly smoked&amp;fried; Canadian style is far less smoked and we cook it at low temp, but still eat it rarely), discard any burnt foods, we rarely toast bread and then only lightly, and we cook most of our foods by poaching (temperature just above 100C).  We &quot;treat&quot; ourselves to a grilled hamburger (medium cooked) and french fries or smoked meats only every couple of months.   When we pass the hot dog vendors on the street with their various sausages dripping hot fat into the flames below (or just on a sizzling grill) heavily browning the meat, we know that the purchasers are ingesting significant amounts of PAHs and HAs (grilled smoked meat!!).  It is not difficult to lose desire for such foods  -- or to limit indulgence to rare occasions - when one considers the ramifications of making them a regular part of the diet.       Reducing Time Expenditures  Cooking More at a Time  We try to use as little time as possible by cooking enough quantity for two meals (or more).  This means that we buy twice (or even a little more) the amount of salmon fillet (preferred) or steaks for 1 meal and poach or lightly fry with double the vegetables, storing half for the next fish meal two days hence. The small amount extra is saved to be eaten cold - just delicious when it is from the marinated recipe. We treat the chicken similarly, typically cooking 4 whole legs (with thighs) and sometimes even 6 in our oversized frying pan. Pork chops, 4 to 6 depending on size are also cooked in the frying pan with yams or squash, and sauerkraut, made even more delicious by adding canned tomatoes. In cooler months, we occasionally bake a larger amount of poultry or pork (with yam or squash and sauerkraut with the pork) in our conventional oven (though poaching is still preferable because of the lower cooking temperature ) and either freeze or just refrigerate for a later non-fish meal.    Wonders of Roasting Pans     A roasting pan reduces the time spent Kitty actually uses in cooking by allowing us to even cook while we sleep. This six pound chicken stuffed with onions and generously smeared with miso and minced garlic was put into a 220F oven and allowed to &quot;roast&quot; for about 7 hours. We awoke to the delicious aroma of roast chicken. This amount of chicken supplied 5 meals for both Kitty and Paul and the basis of chicken vegetable soup. It was also a sale item ($0.59 per pound - although not range fed item this time).    Using a roasting pan is also great for large numbers of poultry pieces and pork chops or a roast (with added onions and carrots as a minimum) - and a whole turkey of course. All turn out beautifully tender and with lots of delicious juices for gravy and/or soup stock.    In November 2008 Kitty tried slow baking a large salmon fillet (with skin), which we had cut into 6 pieces, along with a quinoa-stuffed acorn squash. We ate 2 of the pieces and 2/3 of the squash that day. The remainder with the accompanying onions, peppers, carrots and mushrooms was put into 2 containers and frozen for the future. (See buying  salmon .) Paul&apos;s portions will be 60% of the total being cooked and Kitty&apos;s 40%. Usually for the size salmon purchased this means that 3 meals are being cooked at a time, no matter the method.  Kitty&apos;s mother never used a roasting pan, but rather employed aluminum foil and Kitty did the same, thinking it was the more modern way. Now having had the wonderful meals that can be made in a roasting pan, she wouldn&apos;t consider anything but for oven roasting. We took advantage of a sale on &quot;utility&quot; turkeys (ones less than perfect - ours had a broken wing) in Bancroft in mid-August 2006 along with the coolish Ontario temperatures and had a delicious 11.3lb roast turkey - complete with dressing (reduced by about 1/4), baked sweet potato, peas and cranberry-raisin sauce . Just delicious! And with enough leftovers for another 6 meals plus soup makings.        Update 5/14/10 Reducing Money Expenditures  Monthly Food Costs  More than a couple times Paul and I have been asked how much money we spend on food. We couldn&apos;t give an exact number but could easily relate our buying practices, such as above under Meat Selection , similarly for Vegetables and in various places on our main Diet Regimen page . As an exercise, Kitty kept track of all food purchases for 30 days beginning on 2/23/06; the total was $354.83 (excluding taxes) and included one eat-out meal - on Paul&apos;s birthday. That comes out to about $5.91 for each of us daily. During this period we made more purchases of longterm items (2-3 month quantities, ie. canned fish and flours), but less on eating out than other months. However, the total is about typical for when we are in Arizona. A similar tally - including longterm items - done on our return to Ontario for 30 days beginning on 5/4/06 totalled CN$393.38; all meals during this period were eaten at home. On 6/11/06 when adding this information here, this amount converted to US$354.04, almost exactly the same as just over 2 months previously in Arizona. This US$ amount in years past would have been noticeably less except that the US dollar has been falling in value against Canadian and other currencies for many months. Also, had we still been living in Toronto, the food expenditures would have been considerably less and the choices greater; transportation costs are far greater for merchants in rural Ontario than in or close to major cities.  For a similar period in February and March 2008, a total again of 30 days, the total food expenditure (in Arizona) was $365.77. This excluded taxes except for dining out on 3 occasions, 1 of which was Paul&apos;s birthday. This comes to $6.10 per person per day. If we had not decided to consume wine daily , the daily expense per person would be less than last year, even though we ate out 2 more times during the period. The reason for this is our purposeful reduction of protein , much of which had been from meat and more frequent fresh salmon. For more detail, the spreadsheet that Kitty used for both 2006 and 2008 Arizona food purchases is available.  Our further modification of low calorie to lower methionine has meant less meat being eaten, which translates into further cost savings. Legumes, which are lower in methionine than most meat and fish make up more of our diet than prior to late 2009, another way we keep our monthly food costs low.      We purchase very few prepared foods because for the most part, much of the nutrient content is less than in fresh foods prepared at home. One of the exceptions is spaghetti sauce. We have found good sauces available at inexpensive prices in both Arizona and rural Ontario - Private Selection Tomato and Basil, marketed by Fry&apos;s in the former and President&apos;s Choice Tomato and Basil plus the Vegetarian Bolognese varieties sold in No Frills and Loblaw&apos;s in the latter. These specific varieties under these brands have no sugar added and do contain olive oil, making them superior to other higher priced spaghetti sauce products. Kitty always &quot;doctors&quot; up the sauce by adding sauteed (in olive oil) onions, garlic and mushrooms and sometimes additional items depending on her planned menus.          Using What&apos;s Available in the Yard or Nearby  The benefits of aloe vera have been the subject of numerous papers, although the gel of the inner leaves has not received until lately as much attention despite being used internally for many years by various population groups. (See Comprehensive Nutrient Review: Aloe Vera Overview at Life Extension Foundation and also University of Maryland Medical Center Alternative/Complementary Medicine - Aloe .) Additionally, studies have shown definite benefit for the use of aloe gel in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, thereby giving scientific rationale for its use as an antidiabetic agent.  R 1  , R 2     Until very recently, the gel only of aloe vera we have seen was all costly, as anyone who has priced it can verify. It was a pleasant surprise in January 2007 to find a gallon of pure aloe vera juice (no water or sugar added) being sold at Trader Joe&apos;s for $6.99. We bought a gallon and many evenings add an ounce to 3 ounces of a combination of cherry and aronia juices. With this product available, Kitty does not plan to go through the work of harvesting the gel from our own many plant. However, the process information is being retained for those who cannot find an good economical source and do have plants worth using for this purpose.  Simply grinding or blending the entire leaf is relatively simple, but includes the latex or yellow exudate from just under the outer green layer which contain anthraquinones that stimulate the activity of the gastrointestinal tract - and is thus responsible for the laxative effect of the plant. Since we have numerous plants on our property in Arizona that often need weeding from around trees, Kitty decided to try harvesting some of the leaves for the gel alone.        After doing lots of reading, Kitty ventured out into the yard in January 2006 to cut off 3 aloe vera leaves and had Paul take a few pics of the first gel harvesting procedure. She knew it would be like filleting a fish so approached the task in that manner, putting the inner gel freed from the outer leaf into a small jar for later blending.   By the third leaf, she had made improvements in her separation technique. Care was taken to not include any of the green and to minimize the amount of yellow exudate.          Paul operated the blender in this cooperative effort; lots of foam developed at high speed but settled out within a few minutes. Unfortunately we found that many of the larger pieces of gel were not well broken apart in the blender. This just meant that our pre-dinner aloe vera, pomegranate, aronia, pineapple juice cocktail was a little chewy. The technique is now to finely cut up the &quot;fillets&quot; after removing from the leaf. More photos in the future of improved methods.        In mid-April 2006, Kitty requested that Paul take some photos of her preparing the last batch of aloe vera gel for juice before their return to Ontario. She had improved her technique by that time and the process went more quickly, even though she was doing more leaves - 8 this particular time.   Using the microwavable bacon cooking tray on which to cut the aloe vera leaves made it possible to contain the liquid gel, thereby avoiding much of the mess that occurred the first few times. The amount collected in the pint blender jar lasts the two of us 6 days used as described above.               Spring in rural Ontario brings with it a number of edible plants that most people just ignore. Paul and his first wife, Dagny Vidinsh, did some local foraging when Paul first built the cottage and several books on wild plants are part of the resident library, including a few by famed naturalist Euell Gibbons and his Ontario counterpart, Erika Gaertner. Kitty found the books fascinating and in May of 2006 she and Paul tried some different harvesting of plants they hadn&apos;t planted - we&apos;d already picked plenty of berries and mushrooms when still in Toronto and only using the cottage for occasional visits.     A moderate walk from the house in May 2006, we found an old stand of cat tails from last year just sending up new shoots. Paul managed to get a few small shoots without completely soaking his feet. Next we checked out another area where we suspected that the particular ferns called fiddleheads were located. Sure enough, we found quite a few (and even more the following week) poking their heads out of the ground. Once home we trimmed the cat tail shoots of their tough outer leaves down to the inner tender portion (left in photo) and cooked them in water till tender. The fiddleheads took more time to clean but cooked up easily in water. The cattail shoots have a mild pleasant taste while the fiddleheads are reminiscent of asparagus in flavor. We repeated this foraging again following years, and froze some parboiled fiddleheads for the summer - they actually taste better, in Kitty&apos;s estimation, when added to seafood stirfry. Interestingly, many Torontonians will pay $6 and $7 per pound for fiddleheads in the city markets when these tasty ferns start to break ground in rural Ontario in mid and late May.      Milkweeds are a common site along rural Ontario roads and different parts are edible at various stages. In the photo are very young shoots that were pulled free of the large rhizome from which they sprout. They were boiled for approximately 4 minutes, the water discarded and then boiled again till tender. The asparagus-like flavor is very nice (Paul actually preferred the young leaves) and we picked more until early June.    Unopened flower buds appeared on nearby plants after mid-June and we found them quite good when boiled once till just tender. Sometime we&apos;ll try the young pods.  A good site for photographs of some of the many wild edible plants - ForagingPictures.com     Berries         The wild strawberry plants in our yard have increased in number as a result of the considerable pruning we did of low tree branches done early Fall 2006. The strawberry sizes themselves are also larger, and we take  delight in them plus ones from a good-sized area just a short walk down the road at the end of June and all of July.      After being washed and detopped, the wild strawberries picked in our yard on June 27 2008 were added to our mostly (store-bought) berries combined with other fruit that we eat daily. Typically we eat the nicest (or ripest) locally foraged fruit separately over Cheerios or vanilla ice cream in order to really experience the flavor. (The strawberry tops all go into Paul&apos;s smoothie .)   There are actually more raspberry canes present since the branch pruning, low bush blackberry too; these share the same area with the strawberries which are beginning to be overrun. The raspberries are very enjoyable beginning in July and the blackberries are delicious starting in August; there are some late raspberries even into the end of August which we delight in finding in our yard and on our out-and-about foraging.      Best of all, was the sight of increased blueberry plant growth near the shoreline of our property, again from increased sunshine resulting from pine branch and cedar spread removal.       Beyond a shallow rocky area off the end of our dock is another spot - reached by careful walk down from above - with some blueberry bushes which Kitty has begun to prune.     Additional scattered areas on parts of the cliff on our property overlooking the lake have been opened for more sunlight to the blueberry bushes that were already there. The blueberry production hasn&apos;t been bountiful in 2008, but while the few dozen berries from these small somewhat scrawny plants are still just a modest handful, they are far more than last year. We are nurturing all of these plants (increasing sunlight and pruning dead wood) with the hopes that the berries will be even more over the coming years. Not only is it fun to have fresh berries for picking right outside our door, but all four of these berries rank at the top of a list of over 1100 foods analyzed, based on typical serving size, for antioxidant content.  R 1        In addition to these berry plants in our own yard, there are numerous locations along the roads (especially the tree-cleared land under power lines) and in open areas of the hundreds of common-use acres of Harcourt Park. Certain spots have numerous raspberry and blackberry canes, and we have found some of the latter that this year had very large berries indeed. The pickings beginning the last 2 weeks in August have been so big that we have frozen enough to last us until we leave for Arizona near the end of October. Summer 2008 was a very good one for raspberries - so many that we froze containers for later in the year (something we hadn&apos;t done in previous years for this berry) and also reduced our purchase of frozen mixed berries.  And at the end of August 2008 we had already begun freezing blackberries since we could not eat them fast enough and far more were yet to ripen. We had also discovered a new (to us) location just filled with plentiful producing blackberry canes.     We expect to continue to use the berry plants beyond our yard to supplement our own plant yield as needed to keep our anti-oxidant intake high - and just for the fun and exercise it adds to a walk. People living in rural areas of Ontario and the northeast portions of the United States (and much of Europe) likely have these same wild berry bushes all around just waiting to be picked and enjoyed. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there are places even in the greater Toronto area where berry bushes are growing on common-use land and available for picking. When visiting in Toledo Ohio in June 2008, we walked through 4 large city preserve parks and saw several locations in each with large numbers of strawberry plants and either or both raspberry and blackberry canes. We helped ourselves to many ripe strawberries and hope that residents or visitors made use of the plentiful other berries when they ripened.    Multi-item foraging on 2 days in our own yard in late July 2008 yielded raspberries and blueberries with a nice quantity of edible mushrooms too.     Apples in the Commons    We first did this together in Harcourt Park way back in September 2000 and used the apples to make apple-raisin sauce. We&apos;ve often noted trees laden with apples (regular and crab) in yards in Wilberforce.  So we were delighted when on a trip to Peterborough (about 80 miles southwest of our Harcourt Park home) we realized that a crabapple tree full of fruit - and falling to the ground - was right in front of our car parked in the NoFrills Supermarket lot facing the sidewalk. Paul removed apples from the tree in groups into a medium sized cardboard box and Kitty removed leaves. While most people who passed by either ignored us or appeared to be puzzled by our efforts, one woman walking her dog stopped to chat and told us she&apos;d done the same thing a few days earlier. She went on to say that she&apos;d made crabapple jelly with her pickings; Kitty related that our plans were for apple raisin sauce similar to our cranberry-raisin sauce , which she found interesting since we don&apos;t put in any sugar.             When Paul was convinced to stop we had a shopping bag very full (estimated 7 to 8 lbs) - and a bit of work ahead of us. Paul and Kitty both did the washing, cutting in half and stem removal, though Paul was tempted to leave just as we did the cores. Kitty cut up about 8 oz of prunes which along with an equal amount of raisins went into the pot with the halved crabapples. Just 2 cups of water to this large pot which was nearly full as we began. Two generous tablespoons of barley malt were added (for additional sweetening) and 3 teaspoons of cinnamon during the cooking. Our original plans were to use the foley food mill after putting batches through the blender but considered the blender output smooth enough. However later when we actually ate some - this preparation work was done on our fasting day - we found that small amounts of remaining fiber detracted from the eating pleasure. So our plans now are to foley mill process each of the 3 containers in the freezer after thawing before using. We did that to the one that we did not freeze and the resulting consistency is very smooth. The taste is distinctly tart but a very nice accompaniment to pork (we had some with leftovers the next day) and delicious on ice cream or along with kefir or yogurt. We plan to try it out on many different items. So this is to show that foraging is not just a country activity - keep an eye out for common usage fruit trees in parks and along sidewalks. We&apos;ve been back recently to that area of Harcourt Park that once was Leeson Farms and where a few remaining old apple trees still bear some fruit. It looks like we can pick enough to eliminate our need for purchasing any while we&apos;re still in Ontario to the very end of October.      Mushroom Foraging  Updated 5/15/10  This was a new experience for Kitty when she and Paul began doing this in 2005 after moving from Toronto to Harcourt Park, although he had done it since building the cottage there 40 years previously. Paul and his previous wife, Dagny Vidinsh, had studied up on the subject (their main mushroom guide is still part of our library) and picked for consumption only what they could easily determine was edible. Two very good resources on the Internet for learning about mushrooms including identification: Rogers Mushrooms and MushroomExpert.com   2008 has been an especially good year for edible mushrooms in Harcourt Park, largely because of the heavy rains during the spring and into mid-summer, but also likely because we spent more time doing it and both of us have become more proficient at spotting the numerous edible variety that grow here.   We were pleased in July when on many foraging walks along the road on which we live, we came home with several edible bolete varieties and some chanterelles, like these that Paul cleaned afterwards on July 24th.    Then on August 5 when we were out for a fast walk around the lake, we happened onto an enormous number of chanterelles just off the road - all in beautiful condition. We filled Paul&apos;s light weight jacket pockets and carried it, so as to keep the mushrooms from being damaged. There were numerous ripe raspberries we had to forego because we hadn&apos;t brought any containers with us. We learned our lesson that day not to go out on any kind of walk without at least several bags for possible found goodies - you just don&apos;t know what you might find unexpectedly.     We were pleasantly surprised on September 25, when investigating a trail off the main road that Kitty had seen when on a solitary walk, to see a tree stump heavily filled on the top with puffballs at a perfect stage for eating. Paul had never seen so many puffballs in one location. We carefully removed all of them and Kitty cleaned them upon our return. They made for a very pleasant meal .  Early research using mushrooms in place of meat in meals has shown that those meals received ratings from test subjects not significantly different in palatability and satiation from those meals that did contain meat, suggesting that mushrooms can play a part in reducing calorie/energy intake. For those who haven&apos;t already discovered the taste pleasure of mushrooms as part of a meal, these results may provide an added incentive to include them.( PMID 18221822 and Science Daily article )  Every spring when we return to Harcourt Park from Ontario we look forward to the mushroom gathering that will begin when the several edible varieties begin to make an appearance.    2009 was another great season with so many picked during the near 5 months they were available that we had more than we could use while resident and therefore froze numerous bags after cooking to take to Arizona for use there.       Pet&amp;Food Experience  With the death of our beloved dog, Moose , we lost not only a special canine but also a meal companion. Starting about early October 2001 there were a number of changes in Moose&apos;s digestion and eating preferences.  For years he would eat all Paul&apos;s cooked table scraps (which were and still are very few) in addition to his nutritious meat/fish with vegetable meals.  Diarrhea began and did not respond to modifications of his previous diet until we made dry dog food the vast majority of the total.  After a month solely eating dry dog food, we reintroduced small amounts of meats (cooked), vegetables, and fruit.  Up until about a week before his sudden deterioration, Moose (12 years old) appeared to have no digestion problems on 2 meals a day as described - and occasional small treats of &quot;street pizza&quot;.     Dessert or &quot;After Meal Snack&quot; (Our Previous Snacks - Now Part of Meal or Dessert)        Update 5/14/10 Terrific Trail Mix  In the summer of 2007, Kitty finally put down in writing a general list of the ingredients that go into the trailmix we have been enjoying since the Fall of 2006 on travels (car and on foot), at parties (dance kinds of course) and part of dessert just because it tastes good. Starting in late March 2008, we started adding gogi or wolfberries, which we have found being carried in our favorite oriental market, Lee Lee&apos;s SuperMart , in Chandler Arizona. (It is sold with the botanical name, fructus lycii.) This fruit of the Lycium barbarum plant has been used in Chinese medicine for many generations and more recently has been written about in Western medical journals describing its hepatic, opthalmic and anti-aging benefits.  R   In the Fall of 2008 we saw dried red dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) in Trader Joe&apos;s, decided to try it and found it a pleasant sour taste. (Research on it in regards to human health potential is sparse but wounds on diabetic rats showed facilitated healing with its topical usage.) In April 2008, before returning to Ontario, we decided to try freeze-dried (peel&amp;seeded) rambutan sold in Trader Joe&apos;s. It tastes like cotton candy - naturally high in sugar and far too sweet to eat alone for our taste. However, we found that only a very small amount is plenty to give our trail mix a pleasant slightly sweet taste for some handfuls ;&gt;) For this fruit human health related research publications are also few: polyphenol comparison with other tropical fruits and persimmon and a comparison of postprandial glucose and insulin responses in non-insulin dependent diabetics. As so very often is the case with Trader Joe&apos;s, they no longer as of Fall 2009 carry dried dragon fruit or freeze-dried rambutan. We have found that this company is only really interested in retaining products that sell in great quantities - if something does not &quot;catch on&quot; quickly, they eliminate it. It is a shame that they do not try to inform their customers as to the health advantage of many of the items they carry. Kitty tried in the past letting them know this about aronia juice but received only the explanation that &quot;it did not sell sufficiently well&quot;; no interest demonstrated in truly informing their customers as to its advantages.  The following items, which no longer include barley and oat flakes due to our reduction in total grain intake, are listed in the order of greatest quantity, but there is no fixed requirement:   pumpkin seeds, raw unsalted  redskin peanuts, roasted unsalted  dark raisins  walnuts  almonds  filberts/hazelnuts   hemp extrusions , broken into small pieces   raw cacao nibs   gogi berries (wolfberries/fructus lycii), raw  dried apricots, cut small  dried figs, cut small  dried cherries   Mix well and store in air tight container in the refrigerator when not dipping into it ;&gt;) This can be mixed in conjunction with muesli since so many of the ingredients are common.       NonDecadent Chocolate              In Paul&apos;s never-ending search for a &quot;better&quot; chocolate he has tried several ways to acquire the nutritional value as well as the delightful taste of this high flavonoid food, not necessarily decadent despite what many have thought in years past.  R 1     R 2   Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols (which includes flavonoids) and, thus, may contribute to the reduction of lipid peroxidation.  R  In addition, dark, but not white, chocolate has been found to decrease blood pressure and improves insulin sensitivity in healthy persons.  R  &quot;Dark chocolate induces coronary vasodilation, improves coronary
vascular function, and decreases platelet adhesion 2 hours after consumption.&quot;  R  Unsweetened baking chocolate, which has no sugar added in the processing and consequently does taste bitter, is among the highest on a list of antioxidant content by typical serving size of the tested 1113 food items from the USDA National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program.  R   We used to buy chocolate chips, but the sugar content is somewhat higher than what is in the Ghirardelli dark chocolate that we are able to buy at a reasonable price at Trader Joe&apos;s in the US - 18g out of 40g total chocolate wgt (45%).   However, Paul would still like to have chocolate with a sugar content in the 20% range, and so he experimented using unsweetened chocolate (from a bulk food store), cocoa and honey.      (Purchase of a lower sugar content chocolate is quite possible but found to be expensive from our searches.) The first experiment produced a grainy but still OK chocolate-tasting result - but measurements were not taken so the sugar content was unknown.           In late 2004 Paul used a combination of 221g of the Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate (45% sugar) and 142g of unsweetened chocolate - which produces a chocolate with only 27% sugar. (Reminded Kitty of those algebra mixture problems in high school.) The results were nice and smooth and poured quite easily after the two chocolates were thoroughly mixed.                In January 2005, Paul&apos;s batch of &quot;better chocolate&quot; was 336g of the Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate (45% sugar) and 402 grams of unsweetened. We thought that this last would be as low as we would go in sugar content, but in early March 2005 Paul did another batch which was 15% sugar upon completion. Initially, he thought he had &quot;overdone&quot; it, but after a couple of days he found it quite acceptable. Kitty enjoyed the 15% level immediately and now this will probably be the &quot;lower limit&quot; ;&gt;) We eat only a very small amount after each meal with tea - Kitty originally selected the smaller pieces (typically 2 to 3 grams) compared to Paul&apos;s pieces are a bit larger (5 to 6 grams) - and let it melt in our mouths. Delicious!!  Blending a precise low sugar content chocolate became difficult in early 2006 when Trader Joe&apos;s stopped carrying the Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate (45% sugar) in the locations we frequent. The dark chocolate in the bulk food stores in Bancroft is sold without a sugar content and the employees/owners do not know it and would not/could not obtain it. Therefore it was a pleasure when Trader Joe&apos;s began in Spring 2006 to carry PoundPlus 72% Dark Chocolate (17.6 oz/500g; 34.2% sugar). While it is twice the sugar content of the lowest Paul was blending, it is still quite low in this respect, it tastes very nice and is definitely convenient. Just no more chocolate to clean out of the warming pot....:-( With the change to eating 1 extended meal 2 days out 3 (and fasting on the 3rd) we increased our amount of Trader Joe&apos;s Pound Plus 72% Dark Chocolate taken near the end of our meal to approximately 5 grams for Kitty and 10 for Paul.  We are also searching for sources of chocolate that are higher in flavonols since cocoa bean processing and even growing location are factors in the content in the end chocolate. Good general source of chocolate information .      In addition to the daily piece of very low-sugar chocolate we each consume (with our first after meal cup of tea), we began in late April 2007 to add cocoa powder to Paul&apos;s smoothie, and then found that 2 rounded tsp (~7 grams) of cocoa in 1/2 cup of plain yogurt is quite pleasant. This was increased gradually to 2 Tbs (~14 grams) in about 3/4 C of yogurt by September 2007. With our change to intermittent fasting in early July 2008 , Kitty increased the cocoa, in about 1 C of yogurt, to 3 slightly rounded T (~20 grams) since we are eating only 2 extended meals every 3 days.  Cocoa is a very good source of protein (19.6g/100g) and dietary fiber (33.2g/100g); see USDA - Cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened . Additionally, non-alkalized (unDutched) cocoa is an excellent source of polyphenols.  R  Another source of cocoa that we use on an irregular basis is raw cacao nibs that Kitty includes in trailmix and, more recently, in muesli .  We have continued to experiment with ways to increase our meal intake of cocoa to a desirable level of 50 grams daily. Paul continues to add ~100 grams to his same 4 meal mix of smoothies that we consume in 3 meals, and Kitty has modified her hot cereal by adding ~50 grams to the quantity that we previously ate over 4 days but now do so in 3 meals. Our total typical extended meal intake (2 days out of 3) of cocoa, minus the post meal low fat chocolate, is (as of date of this page) about 38 grams for Paul and 32 for Kitty. We&apos;ve run out of ways to reasonably increase this amount and we don&apos;t want cocoa to be the dominant flavor in all parts of our one meal. The thought of cocoa-stir fried vegetables doesn&apos;t appeal to either of us ;&gt;)      Getting Enough Iron    Paul and Kitty Wakfer do not eat the Standard (North)American Diet (SAD) and therefore consume far less red meat than most, resulting in ingestion of far less iron from animal products (heme iron) than is typical. We also do not use wheat flour (routinely iron fortified) in meal preparation, nor eat pasta and wheat bread, which are routinely enriched including iron fortification. We found in our blood work results of July 2005 ( Kitty and Paul ) that we were both borderline anemic, likely resulting from insufficient iron stores. To improve this situation quickly, in addition to making the added effort to obtain liver in the local rural Ontario supermarkets (which was plentifully available when we lived in Toronto), we added black strap molasses to our daily intake - 1 tablespoon daily, either all at once or a teaspoon at each meal, plain or added to some food item. ( Nutrient values .) Paul tried it in his smoothie and we both find it acceptable taste-wise. The molasses was actually better tasting plain than our supplement &quot;meal cocktail&quot; and we considered simply adding it to the &quot;cocktail&quot; - joking that it  might even improve its taste. :&gt;) We discontinued this regular usage after our labwork in November on our return to Arizona since the results were much improved.

Other good sources of iron that we are making sure we get at least weekly: sardines or a scallop/shrimp combination (both heme - ~40% of iron from animal tissues and more readily absorbed) and spinach (non-heme - all iron from plant sources and elemental components of animal tissues, less readily absorbed unless iron stores are already low). And our weekly diet consists of at least moderate amounts of foods that contain lesser amounts of heme and non-heme iron - dried fruits (especially apricots), legumes, other green vegetable, eggs and poultry.
