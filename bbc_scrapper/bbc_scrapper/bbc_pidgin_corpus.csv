Di proposal na to jail any pesin wey pay for up to 15 years. Oga Ado say im two daughters bin dey drive with police convoy for Buruku road, Kaduna state, wey dey notorious for criminal gang, wen dem kidnap dem for December.

Oga Ado tok say wen you see say men wey carry gun dey threaten di lives of your loved ones, you no get choice but to drop money. Lawmakers wan ban ransom only because ""dem neva get family member wey dem kidnap"", na wetin im add. But lawmakers dey argue say dat kai payments na im dey ginger di kidnap industry wia criminal gangs go just tiff pipo and ask for anytin from $50 to $1m.

For tori wey be like dem tiff am from Nollywood feem, dem carry di pipo wey gt di cash for road wey lead from Lagos to Sapele, inside di Niger Delta, wey dem tell dem to drop di money for side of road, na wetin im tok. Kontris like US and UK no dey pay ransom to kidnappers, say di best way to stop kidnapping na to stop di ginger. But for kontris like France, Germany, Spain and Italy, tori be say dem don pay millions of dollars to free dia citizens wey African jaguda pipo hold or elsewhere. Tori be say even Nigerian federal goment don drop correct money give kidnappers before, like give Boko Haram so dem go free some of di Chibok girls dem kidnap for 2014, as Kastina sef drop money for di di release of schoolboys dem kidnap for 2020.

While 14 aspirants dey hope to be candidate of di PDP, di ruling APC get up to 23 aspirants. Di new Electoral Act allow political parties to adopt one of direct, indirect and consensus mode of primaries. Experts including Inec advise parties to adopt consensus mode to avoid wahala.

E say ""na dat time governors and political leaders dey pad di list wit unknown pipo. Direct primaries dey give chance to legal wahala too much.""

To use statutory delegates also dey expensive becos e dey attract too much crowd."" Except President Muhammadu Buhari sign di Electoral Act 2022 Amendment Bill na only ad-hoc delegates political parties go fit use for dia national convention. ""Wen di National Assembly dey pass di Electoral act dem do am in a hurry. Dem forget dia sef.

Section 84 (12) of Nigerian Electoral Act 2022: Everything you need to know	"Section 84 (12) of Nigerian Electoral Acts na one controversial clause wey dey cause tok-tok. Dis na as Nigeria voting centre stage don dey heat-up ahead of di 2023 general election. President Muhammadu Buhari don tell all im cabinet members wit ambition to contest elections to resign. Court of Appeal on Wednesday disagree wit one ruling by di federal high court for Umuahia wey cancel di controversial Section 84 (12) of di Electoral Act 2022. On 19 March, 2021 one Federal High Court rule say Section 84 (12) no follow law, ask di Attorney General of di Federation to remove am from di Nigerian Electoral Act 2022. Di court say di law dey illegal and na violation of di provisions of di 1999 Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). So why ""Section 84 12 of Nigerian Electoral Act"" dey controversial? Di Appeal Court judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike in her ruling uphold di Sections 66(1)(f); 107(1)(f); 137(1)(g); and 182(1)(g) of di 1999 Constitution wey say appointees of goment wey dey seek to contest elections go only resign at least 30 days to di date of di election, Di judge say any oda law wey mandate such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before dat day dey unconstitutional. E dey invalid, illegal, null and void to di extent of im inconsistency as di Constitution don already provide. Justice Anyadike rule on 11 May. She later direct make dem strike down di Section 84(12) of di Electoral Act, 2022, say e no fit stand.

Wetin dis mean be say, any pesin wey dey hold political appointment like ministers, commissioners, special advisers, personal assistants dem, weda dem dey serve for federal or state level no go fit vote and nobody go fit vote for am for primaries. Therefore, since nobody vote for am for primaries, e mean say im no be candidate for any election. Di only way pesin fit be candidate na to resign before di primaries. In a situation wia one political party fail to comply wit Section 84(12) of di Electoral Act, subsection 13 of di same Section say dat di political party candidate no go dey included in di election for di particular position di candidate dey fill in for. On March 1, Mr. Buhari write a letter to both chambers of di National Assembly requesting dem to delete Section 84(12) of di Electoral Act.

Warning: Dis tori get ogbonge description of kasala. Efe Uwanogho wey dem dey also call Omote Biafra dey do Facebook live to her more dan 40,000 followers dey shout hate speech for di camera. She dey wear leather jacket wey dem patch di Biafran flag on top. She dey shout ""Go afta dis ogbonge destroyers... dis na di pipo wey dem suppose cut dia head.

Di campaign get bloody history. For 1967, separatists wey mainly come from Igboland declare independence for di Republic of Biafra. Dem fight and loose di three year civil war against di Nigerian goment wey kill pass one million pipo, most of dem na separatists. Ova 50 years later, and di fight don get anoda frontline for social media. And pipo like Ms Uwanogho dey among di pipo wey dey ginger am. Dem be so called ""media warrior"" for di Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob). She dey do her broadcast from Italy wey dey far from Nigeria authorities. Dis na sake of say Nigeria don ban and designate Ipob as terrorist group even though dem insist say dem be peaceful organisation. BBC investigation show plenti oda influential Ipob supporters wey dey ginger from outside di kontri dey promote fake news and ginger violence for social media from Europe, America, Asia and even oda parts of Africa. Nigeria investigative tori pesin Nicholas Ibekwe tok say di group online operation be like ""organised troll farm"". E say, ""Social media na Ipob most successful tool to take do most of wetin dem wan do today"". Some supporters of di group get up to 100,000 followers for social media. We no know if Ms Uwanogho followers don do wetin she dey go online to ask for - violence against officials for south-eastern Nigeria. Ms Uwanogho no gree ansa calls to chook mouth for dis tori. But kasala don dey real for ground and don cause di death of plenti officials dis year alone, for attacks wey Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari say dey ""deeply distressing"". Nneka Igwenagu na anoda ""media warrior"" wey dey fight for Biafra all di way for di UK.

We contact Ms Igwenagu make she chook mouth for dis tori, she no ansa. One of di ways , dis ""media warriors"" dey try dodge censorship na to speak for local languages wey no dey as moderated.

Dat na until, BBC carri di links of di videos send give Facebook na wen dem comot am. But at di time wey dis article go comot more violent broadcasts from dis same accounts and odas still dey online. Facebook parent company Meta tell us for statement say violence for dia platform dey unacceptable. Dem say dem get ova 15,000 pipo wey dey review content for more dan 70 languages, wey include igbo. Our investigation show Ipob supporters dey spread fake news to ginger tension between different ethnic groups for Nigeria. Media warriors dey chook ethnic Igbo pipo wey be mostly Christians from south and Fulani ethnic group wey be mostly Muslim head togeda. Ms Igwenagu tell her followers for anoda Facebook live say, Fulani herders wey move enta ""Biafraland"" dey on ""mission... to kill, injure and wipe all of us (out)"". Although kasala don dey between Fulani herders and south east communities, proof no dey of wetin Ms Igwenagu and odas dem dey tok. Dis tok-tok wey dey ginger kasala fit dey because of Biafran independence but our investigation show proof say money dey ginger di actions of those wey dey tok am. We find videos wia media warriors say dem collect money either by Ipob or supporters, for dia work, and oda broadcasts show say dem dey post bank details for Ipob make followers donate money.

Airlines strike in Nigeria update: Ibom air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, odas go continue flight schedules as operators suspend action	"Di Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) don suspend dia plan to strike and stop flights schedule across di kontri. Di strike bin suppose start on Monday but di AON President Abdulmunaf Sarina tok inside statement wey six members of di association jointly sign say dem announce di suspension say dem do am in di interest of di national economy and security considerations. Di Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) bin don say di strike no go make sense and e go amount to exploitation if airlines suspend flights afta collecting money for tickets from passengers. Di operators dey complain of di increase in price of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel. Nigeria goment bin also beg di operators to ""reconsider dia stand"" sake of di effect. Di cost of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel don increase from N190 per litre to N700, dis na according to di airline operators of Nigeria. Abdulmunaf Sarina, president of di operators for letter wey e send to Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say di high cost of di fuel dey affect di operation cost of airlines. E say, ""while aviation fuel worldwide dey cost about 40% of airline operating cost globally, di present hike don increase Nigeria operating cost to about 95%."" Abdulmunaf Sarina say airlines dey run at a loss sake of di situation and e no good for dia business. ""Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wish to regrettably inform di general public say member airlines go discontinue operations nationwide wit effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice."" Nigeria Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say true-true aviation fuel don cost and e dey affect air transport. But di minister say make di operators look for anoda means to address di mata rather dan suspend flight activities. E say, im no fit do much because mata wey concern fuel no dey under im ministry. ""While efforts to manage di situation dey on, we wish to appeal to di airline operators, even in di difficult situation, to consider di multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking dia business-informed decisions and actions,"" e tok for statement by im special assistant on public affairs, Dr James Odaudu. Dis no be di first time operators bin plan to take dis kain action. Wen e happun e dey affect air travel. For March dis year, di operators bin complain about di same aviation fuel but dem no fit reach resolution wit goment and stakeholders for di oil industry. Earlier dis year, airline operators increase price or air fare by 50%. For instance, a trip of N23,000 before increase to N50,000. Di operators claim say di increase for di price of tickets na sake of di high cost of aviation fuel. Air travellers complain wella during dat period but pipo still continue to travel by air. Wit di latest plan to bin suspend dia business, e no clear weda dem wan increase di price of dia ticket again. Di six airline operators wey bin sign di statement to suspend strike include Abdulmunaf - Managing Director of Azman Air; Shehu Wada - Executive Director of Max Air; and Obiora Okonkwo - Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines. Odas be Roy Ilegbodu - Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air; Abdullahi Mahmood - Chief Executive Officer of Aero Contractors; and Allen Onyema - Chairman of Air Peace. Earlier, di Ministry of Aviation bin assured Nigerians say members of AON bin dey review dia decision to withdraw services on Monday, May 9. Dem bin confam say Ibom Air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, and odas go carry on with dia normal flight schedules. Incidents of insecurity don make some Nigerians avoid travelling by road. Di recent Kaduna-Abuja train attack by terrorists also neva comot from pipo mind. If airlines suspend dia operations as planned, Nigerians go begin look for oda means of traveling. Though Ibom airline don announce say dem no go join di suspension - only dem no go fit cater for all di thousands of travellers wey dey make dia trip by air. But di remaining alternative go come be di use of private jets or airplane charter. E get several private jet charter companies for Nigeria wey dey offer those services. Di service dey expensive. Findings show say, a 40 minute to one hour trip within di kontri, cost up to N2 million ($5,500). Some pipo fit also do join hire of a private jet wey fit carry specific number of pipo. Dem go share di bill among dem sef. E neva clear weda di airline suspension go take effect from Monday but pipo don begin reason oda alternatives."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-61369130

Indonesia ban export of palm oil: Wetin e mean for Africa wia Nigeria be largest producer	"Indonesia don ban export of any kind of palm oil wit immediate effect. So wetin e mean for Africa? Di Southeast Asian kontri dey account for more dan half of world palm oil supply, don sama ban on anykind Wetin cause di export ban be say Indonesia pipo don start protest against increase for di price of cooking oil. Di price increase don disturb dia local supply. So di question now be say wia Africa wey dey import oil wela go turn to next for supply. For 2021, Africa bin spend five billion dollars to import estimate of four million metric tonnes of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. One tonne of palm oil be about $1,850 for di commodity exchange for Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. E den add, anoda 150 to 200 US dollars for transport and handling costs, per tonne. Dis mean say, di real cost to deliver one tonne of palm oil anywhere on di continent be about $2,000. Wetin dey dia be say, di ban fit expose Africa largest producer of palm oil-Nigeria wey be former world largest producer for di 1960s. Nigeria bin dey produce one small 1.4m metric tonnes for 2021, compare to Indonesia 44.5 million metric tonnes. Di ban dey come just a month since global sunflower oil supply bin dey thrown off-balance. Na di Ukraine-Russia war, as dat one bin add pressure to household budgets. Indonesia restriction on exports, go now dey somehow for Africa pipo wey dey already struggle wit di effects of high fuel and food price sake of global supply chain wahala. Already, di price of product like soap and cooking oil don increase and di situation fit only get worse. Palm oil dey in use wella to manufacture vegetable oil. But e get plenti products wey dey comot from palm oil: Frying fats, cosmetics and cleaning products like soaps. Importers like India, Bangladesh and Pakistan go try buy more palm oil from Malaysia. But di world second-biggest palm oil producer no fit fill di gap wey Indonesia create sake of labour shortage. Indonesia mostly dey supply nearly half of India total palm oil import. While Pakistan and Bangladesh import nearly 80% of dia palm oil from Indonesia. Connie Magomu, di General Manager, National Oil Palm Project, for Uganda say di ban sef be opportunity. Magomu see am as good chance for Africa kontries to develop dia own palm oil sector. ""E dey very efficient for land use, as e dey produce more oil per unit area dan any oda crop wey we sabi (E dey give between four to 10 times more oil per unit area)."" ""E be also one good crop for poverty reduction sake of once e reach maturity for three and half years. ""E go dey harvested every 10 days for 20 to 25 years"", She add. Uganda don dey promote local production of palm and need at least 100,000 hectares to dey self-sufficient. Kontries for Africa wia di opportunity to grow and expand di production of di commodity be: Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Burundi, DRC Congo and Tanzania."

Di most painful part and wetin I dey always remember be say she die for my hands on our way to di hospital. Dat na how Sani Bature wey dey stay Kano for northwest Nigeria begin im tori to BBC News Pidgin of how malaria kill im five-months-old pikin Halima two years ago. United Nations set aside 25th April of every year as Malaria Day to tok about issues wey concern di disease wey still dey kill hundred of thousands of pipo for Africa each year. According to latest wey World Health Organisation release on Monday to tok about Malaria dem say about 95% of 228 million cases of di sickness come from Africa and for di continent na 602,020 pipo die from am for 2021. Sani say anytime e hear about di statistics for Radio or Television e dey remind am of im daughter and how she for don grow by now. Unlike before wey I no dey mind, now anytime I hear malaria stats for radio or TV e dey remind me of Halima and how she for don grow by now, Sani tok. She don already learn to siddon and me and her dey play wella anytime I dey house. Deaths from Malaria especially for pikin dem na im don make WHO approve one vaccine for children to treat Malaria. During di trials of di vaccine for Malawi, Ghana and Kenya dem find out say di vaccine reduce malaria cases by forty per cent. Di mother Zahrau Mustapha say she dey think of Halima every blessed day even though God don bless her with another Daughter, Safiya, wey recently clock nine months. Halima na my first child and I born her on 20th September 2019 and she die on 4th March 2020. No single day wey I no dey think of her. She add say di death of Halima don make dem dey take extra care in terms of protecting themselves from Malaria. After her death we buy extra mosquito nets and we dey quick enter and for our baby na double net for her because inside our net she get her own inside and also insecticide dey always dey now. Zahrau call on goments to bring back the mosquito spray wey dey happun before many areas before now. Years ago e get pipo from health or environment agencies wey dey come spray our area with mosquito repellent but now nothing like dat again. Goment suppose bring back dat program. Sani say for Gurin Gawa area wey dem dey for Kano no be only dem lose pikin from Malaria as some of im neighbours also suffer di same fate. For most cases, malaria dey transfer through di bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes - na more than 400 different species of Anopheles mosquito dey, of which around 30 dey carri malaria. Di mosquitoes wey dey spread di disease dey bite usually wen pipo dey sleep for night. As 25 April na World Malaria Day, dis na wetin you suppose sabi about di disease: Malaria signs - high fever, headache, and cold - go usually appear 10-15 days afta mosquito wey get infection bite. E fit dey small and hard to recognise say na malaria, but if dem no treat am within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria fit lead to serious sickness, wey fit lead to death. Dr Usman Qalbusunnah na medical doctor for Rigasa General hospital for Kaduna state (northwest Nigeria) and e say despite plenty efforts malaria still dey on di increase across di kontri. On a daily basis 60% of patients wey I dey attend to na malaria cases wey show say di illness still dey go up despite all efforts to end it. Anoda thing be say na di resistant form of malaria dey now wia be say treatment dey take longer in fact some patients go return to hospital after a week or two wit di same malaria symptoms. Dr Usman say prevention and not treatment na di way to go so far as Malaria dey concern because no matter di improvement in treatments if cases continue dey happun e no go augur well for society. Na goment get biggest role to play for dis issue, first provide good drainages for areas and also refuse dumps suppose dey far away from pipo. As for individuals pipo suppose make sure say dia homes dey clean and free from dirty, stagnant water and dirty wey dey attract mosquitoes and make pipo dey sleep inside treated mosquito nets.

Nigeria na major landing point for di cable and di launch of dis digital access happun Thursday 21 April 2022. ""Dis Cable Landing [in Lagos] go provide approximately ""20 times more network capacity"" than di last cable dem build to serve di region."" Juliet Ehimuan, Director of Google for West Africa tok during one event to mark di launch. Better data connection and cheaper Internet, job creation and more go follow di launch, one Lagos goment official tok on Tuesday. Nigeria na Equiano second stop inside Africa, with future landings wey dey expected in Swakopmund, Namibia; and Melkbosstrand, South Africa. Equiano, wey name dey inspired by a Nigerian, go dey land at different points inside Africa, much like a road construction wey dey progress. Google Equiano na state of di art submarine Internet cable. Di tech search engine, Google, alongside one of dia major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC) na im dey arrange dis project. Di cable dey set to completely land on Friday, April 29, 2022. According to Google, di cable run from Portugal, through di West coast of Africa and all di way to South Africa. Di Internet cable, dey named after Olaudah Equiano, one historical abolitionist.

Di tech giant believe say dis infrastructure go boost Nigeria GDP by over $10billion dollars over a three-year period. Di subsea cable na West Indian Ocean Cable Company build am wit funding from Google to provide Open Access to internet service providers and businesses. If you dey wonder, submarine Internet cables na one of di primary reasons you fit easily read dis article. Na sake of dis technology you fit stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. So submarine cable launch and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria na like cause and effect. Nowadays, di average internet speed wey bin dey Nigeria na 18.7 Mbps, according to tech reviews - wey mean say internet data connection no too fast. For example, if you currently get a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, e go take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Back in di early 2000s, na very few pipo bin get phones and computers, and accessing di Internet dat time bin require buying time for cybercafe. Even wen mobile phones become available, you go likely waste time loading one page wit plenti pictures or trying to stream a video. As more business owners increase dia interest in Africa, technology begin to improve. 2009 record a major mile stone during di launch of di MainOne submarine cable, wey be one private submarine cable wey today spread between Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire. Afta dis launch, companies like Glo and MTN launch dia own submarine cables inside Nigeria. And na so internet access too begin increase, and more tech companies begin open shop for di kontri. Experts don tok say wit improved internet access, Africa fit catch up wit development across di continent. All things being equal, Google Internet cable fit drop di average download time to 1.2 minutes from 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Di tech giant don commit demsef to invest $1billion inside Africa in di next five years to improve access. If we believe Google claim, Equiano fit bring six times much faster Internet of 112 Mbps. Lagos be like di silicon valley of Nigeria, sake of say na di one state wey get high technology innovation. And di city wit over 22 million population na Nigeria commercial capital. Anoda major public gain fit dey for speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. Dis mean say you fit experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load. And, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts. Some Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data for di rate of 666. But all things being equal, dis fit drop to 140, according to wetin experts dey project from Equiano Cable landing. Google for July 2018 launch Google Station wey be dia fast speed internet station for Lagos, Nigeria. Wetin sweet pipo belle dat time na say e no go cost anytin to use dis internet, because na free!

Kano State: Why Nigeria historic dye pits fit close down	"For more than six centuries, one area for di historic city of Kano for northern Nigeria na di home to dye pits, wia dem dey use ancient techniques to produce beautiful fabrics. Di materials - wey dem dey mostly dye for deep blue colour - don sell across Africa and di Middle East. But many pipo dey worry say di industry now dey at risk. 'Di young generation no wan join di dyeing,' one Baba Muhammad complain as he squat near one wide pit, wey full wit one colo, indigo coloured liquid. Di 75-year-old dip one piece of cloth into di hole, cover im hands wit rubber gloves. Di veteran dyer dey worry say im go be one of di last pipo to perform di ancient ritual as young pipo don get more modern taste. 'Dem prefer to go into business; dem like to design di fabrics, but no be to dye am.' Di Kofar Mata dye pits - wey dem establish for di beginning of di16th Century be di source of livelihood for thousands of local pipo. Na women dey usually create di unique design of di fabrics wey dem go twist and tie di material for dia houses into different shapes to produce di patterns. Dem go later give di tied clothes dem to di dyers. Kano city na one important economic hub for northern Nigeria and e get strong leg for di trans-Saharan trade for pre-colonial times. Historians dey tok of how Tuaregs - wey dem dey call 'blue men of the desert' - sake of di colour of dia clothes - dey visit di city. Wetin follow sweet pipo about di Kofar Mata fabric, na di locally sourced and natural ingredients wey dem dey use to dye di clothes. Till today, dyers tok say dem dey avoid artificial ingredients, and dey use things like di local indigo plant, wey dey give di material e colour. But based on how things be for now, dis ancient tradition don dey face plenty threats. One na di Boko Haram insurgency. As dis one don mean say customers no dey - especially those wey dey travel through di north-east of Nigeria wia di Islamist militants dey active. E don also affect those wey dey come from front.

Oga Hamisu dey old enuf to sabi wen dyeing be dyeing, e say ""wen I be pikin, di dye pits bin dey uncountable, now we only get 144, and like 15 we dey use"". Kano na among di fastest growing cities for sub-Saharan Africa. In di last few years, e don see as dem demolish some of its historical sites wey goment say dey necessary so dem go fit transform am to modern city. Tijjani Muhammad Naniya, wey be historian for di Kano Bayero University, say urbanisation no be di only thing wey wan kill dye pits. E explain say, 'di problem start from one colonial policy to change Kano economy, wey make di city start to dey import clothes from Manchester and oda placs abroad'. Di rise of cheap abroad clothes na major wahala for local dyers. Dem say although di prices dey di same, competition dey as many customers prefer new and flashy modern designs. Many of di men wey dey work for di pits na descendant dyers, like Haruna Baffa, wey be di secretary of di Kofar Mat Dye Pits. E say im be di seventh generation. ""My seventh great grandpapa, Muhammadu Dabosa, na im be di founder of dis pit centre"". Di dyers say dem no dey gt any help from local or regional goments. Oga Hamisu say dem fit do more to preserve di industry wey get historical significance. E say, 'if goment buy our products and ginger pipo to buy am, we go thrive'. 'Imagine say di president or one govnor wear one of our Kofar Mata fabrics, even if pipo bin dey look am say e dey worthless before, e go become valuable.'

For statement on Sunday, di NRC say out of 362 passengers wey bin dey di train wen dem attack am, 186 dey confam safe. Dem follow tok say wia 168 of di passengers still dey unknown. E no clear how many of di 168 don dey kidnapped for ransom - some fit don return to dia homes and no tell di authorities. One survivor don tell di BBC how one decision to change coach na im save im life and dat of im family. ""I dey happy say I dey alive and well,"" as he follow tok condition of say e go dey anonymous. ""But I feel so sad for di pipo wey die and di ones wey injure - e fit be me,"" na so di man, wey almost miss di train tok. Im say na rush im rush wit im wife and two children to make am on time.

But di govnor of Kaduna state dey suspect say na Boko Haram Islamists dey collabo wit one kidnapping gang, and e follow tok say dem don start rescue operations, but e no tok of any payment of ransoms. As roadside kidnapping dey very common between Abuja and Kaduna, many pipo believe say di train service na di only safe and affordable option wey remain. But dis na di second attack by suspected bandits for dis same route in six months. ""Nigerians don finally agree say nowhere dey safe,"" na so journalist and security watcher Chris Paul Otaigbe tok. ""Many go just like to stay for house or for dia domot,"" e follow tok, as e add say businesses wey dey depend on di steady flow of pipo between north-western Nigeria and Abuja go suffer di most. Despite promises to make Nigeria train network safe afta one attack for October, e be like say dem no make any progress. ""I dey devastated and I honestly no know wetin to tell Nigerians any more,"" na so Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi tok last week afta di attack. ""Di process to procure di integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution don dey hard. If the process bin dey shortened, we for don save lives."" 18 policemen bin dey on board Monday train, na so e tell BBC, but dem dey outgunned and eventually run out of ammunition. Di future plan be say military aircraft go dey escort passenger trains between Kaduna and Abuja once dem finish repair work for di 190km (120-mile), according to Oga Amaechi. But e deny say di failure to protect passengers na symptom of Nigeria wider security failures. ""You no fit say Nigeria na failing state,"" na wetin Oga Amaechi tok. ""If you wan deal wit insecurity, you gats first and foremost deal wit poverty."" Opposition politician Kassim Afegbua of di Peoples Democratic Party wey tok say e ""utterly ashamed"" by wetin im consider to be goment inaction bin tok say make President Muhammadu Buhari resign.

Dem bin promise similar system six months ago but no deliver. Oga Shehu sha reject evidence say suspected bandits bin attack Kaduna city airport for March, saying ""yes, dem shoot one civilian surveillance official near di perimeter fence, wey dey very sad, but dem bin no enta di Kaduna airport"".

Abuja-Kaduna train attack: Buhari don call di pipo wey carry out di attack 'terrorists'	"Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari don tok say e dey pained ova di second attack on di Abuja-Kaduna train. E say ""our thoughts dey with di family of di pipo wey die and our prayers dey with those wey injure"". Buhari tok dis one afta meeting with Security Chiefs for Abuja. Di Abuja-Kaduna train attack on Monday, 28 March, leave eight pipo dead and 26 wit injury. Dis na according to di Kaduna state Commissioner for di ministry of internal security and home affairs, Samuel Aruwan. Di suspected bandits bin use explosives for di track wey force di train to stop. Afta di train stop, gunmen bin surround di carriages and start to dey shoot na wetin one of di passengers tell BBC. Oga Aruwan say, according to train documents, na 362 pipo bin enta di train according to di recognised turnstile. ""Investigations still dey go on to know which passengers bin dey di train wey dey unaccounted for at di time of dis update"". But e no take into account di number of NRC staff and security officials wey bin dey di train. Different reports dey circulate for di media say di numba of passengers fit plenti pass wetin dem dey count, so di goment dey try find out di exact number. Meanwhile, di Nigerian Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi don blame di lack of security solutions due to di process wey im say bin dey very slow for di incident. E say if di process bin dey shortened, dem for don save lives. Before di latest attack, many pipo bin dey tink as di safest way to go between Abuja and Kaduna, na by di train. Kidnapping for ransom don become common for Nigeria. Di Abuja-Kaduna highway na one of di most dangerous roads for Nigeria, sake of say kidnappers dey attack vehicles for di expressway and di road sef no good. Dis don make many pipo abandon di road to go by rail wey dem bin open for 2016. Di train dey more expensive but pipo see am say na im safe pass sake of di trains dey get armed guards inside. Dis go be di second time, di rail line between dis two cities go dey attacked in di last six months but di latest attack on Monday na di baddest one. So far, di Nigeria President don order di conclusion of di process to get and install di Integrated Security Surveillance and Monitoring (ISSM) for di Abuja-Kaduna rail line and make dem extend am to di Lagos-Ibadan rail line.

Di govnor of Kaduna state, Nasir El-Rufai condemn di attack, wey im call ""terrorist attack"" and e tok sorry to di families of di victims. E follow tok say im goment go ffot di medical bill of pipo wey dem carry go hospital. Di Kaduna authorities say dem dey collabo with di NRC to find out wia all di passengers dey and who dey miss.

Nigeria vs Ghana: NFF get questions to answer about Eguavoen and Super Eagles - Reasons Nigeria no qualify for Qatar 2022 World Cup	"Tuesday 29 March 2022 na date wey many Nigerians no go ever forget. Dis na because na di date wey di Super Eagles fail to qualify for di 2022 Qatar World Cup afta dem lose to Ghana. Di Black Stars shock di over 60,000 pipo wey bin dey inside di Moshood Abiola stadium as dem win on away goal rule afta di match end 1-1. Di first leg for di Baba Yara stadium for Kumasi bin end goalless. Ahead of Tuesday match, Nigeria coach Austin Eguavoen bin dey confident say dem go beat Ghana but wetin really be di reasons wey make dem crash out? As di dust dey settle on di Super Eagles failure to qualify for Qatar 2022 World Cup, old actions by di Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) don dey rise again. Chief of which, na di sacking of German coach, Gernot Rohr just days before di Afcon go start. China Acheru believe say di NFF bin no get any plan afta dem sack Rohr and e show. ""A lot of pipo go tok of Gernot Rohr sack and dem tink say e dey wrong. I never call for Rohr sack but I support di sack and im bin come at di right time,"" Acheru tok. For Acheru: ""Nothing bin dey wrong about Rohr sack, wetin bin dey wrong na say di NFF bin no get plan afta dem sack Rohr. Dem push Paseiro name and den bring in Austin Eguavoen and dem say di Portuguese go take over. You know how e happen, e become complete mess."" Eguavoen before im takeover as interim coach bin dey serve as NFF Technical Director. Di former Super Eagles captain later step down from dat interim role on Wednesday according to di NFF. According to NFF, Eguavoen go return to im role as Technical Director but di coaching set up wey support am for Afcon and di new ones wey NFF add before di match against Ghana all don chop sack. Dis don make Nigerian football followers ask wetin di former Bendel Insurance and Sharks FC coach wan bring as Technical Director wen ""im fail to do well against Tunisia and also fail to beat Ghana?"". One fan wey BBC Pidgin tok to bin ask. Some also add join say Eguavoen return to im Technical Director role ""make zero sense."" For better context, di coaches of Algeria, Egypt and Democratic Republic of Congo all turn in dia resignation afta dem fail to carry dia kontris go di World Cup. Dis coaches no longer get anytin to do wit dos kontris but dat no be di case wit Eguavoen. A statement from di NFF say dem go announce new management team ""after proper review"" and dem go dey charged to ""give new energy to di Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately"". Going into dis match tied at 0-0, di importance of di away goal rule become all di mor important. Especially as Ghana come score first through Thomas Partey shot from outside di box afta 10 minutes. Dat goal itself become ""massive lift for Ghana,"" according to ACLsports Chief Football writer, Fisayo Dairo. Di Super Eagles rally demsef back to equalise soon afta through Troost Ekong penalty but lack urgency for dia second half performance. Fisayo add say: ""At a time dem [Nigeria] need to continue with wetin dem do for di first half afta dem concede dem become flat."" Dat second half performance make one wonder if di players bin dey aware of di Fifa away goal rule. According to Fifa: ""Di aggregate score, wey be di team wit di most goals from di two matches, go determine di winner of Home & Away competition. If di game still dey tied, di side wit di most away goals go dey declared as di winner."" ""We need to fix our league, no be becos na im make us lose but e go prevent us from going to third division of Europe leagues to get a goalkeeper"". Na so Nigeria Football sabi pesin, China Acheru tell BBC Pidgin. Im bin dey refer to di mistake wey Francis Uzoho wey dey play for Omonia Nicosia of Cyprus make wey give Ghana early lead. Di 6 feet, 5 inches tall goalkeeper attempt to stop Partey shot see di ball go under im body and into di net. Uzoho bin be one of di shining light for di first leg against Ghana wey dem play for di Baba Yara stadium. ""I think we (Super Eagles) bin dey unlucky, on anoda day Nigeria for beat Ghana. I think di Eagles play better for Abuja dan dem do for Ghana."" Uzoho only make di starting lineup as Nigeria number one, Maduka Okoye bin dey ruled out of di match as im bin no well. But even before di Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper absence against Ghana, question mark don dey about di goalkeeping position of di Super Eagles. Between di three senior goalkeepers for Nigeria - Okoye (13 caps), Uzoho (18 caps) and Daniel Akpeyi (19 caps) - none of dem don make more dan 19 times for di National team. Dis clearly point to di fact say not one of dem don fully get di trust of coaches wey don handle di team. Even factors like injuries to Uzoho and Okoye sickness don play role of dis evenly shared caps. Even before dis play-off match, Nigerians bin don dey quick to point to Okoye error wey see Tunisia beat dem 1-0 for di round of 16 of Afcon 2021. Im poor judgement on di flight of di ball see Youssef Msakni score di only goal wey eliminate di much fancied Super Eagles. Some go argue say Uzoho (23) and Okoye (22) still dey young wen compared to di careers and longevity of goalkeepers but for how long Nigerians go continue to wait for dat trusted hand in between di goal?"

Bread price in Nigeria: Why loaf of bread fit increase?	"E be like say di price of bread for Nigeria go soon increase sake of rising production costs. Bakers under di Premium Breadmakers Association of Nigeria (PBAN) tok say dem wan increase di price of bread so dem no go shut down dia operations. President of PBAN Emmanuel Onuorah tell BBC Pidhin say dis na sake of di high cost of diesel and di fact say materials wey dem dey use produce di bread also don drastically increase. E say dis factors don already make some bakers close dia businesses. ""Many members don close down or sack workers because dem no fit meet up again. Our business dey face loss."" Onuorah say before di Covid-19 pandemic, flour na between N8000 to N10,300 per bag but now na about N22,500.

""Our capacity don reduce by 50%. Pesin wey dey do 100 nags now e dey do 40 bags or less, yet we dey pay tax and provide our own light and water, which kain tin be dis?"" ""So as e be so, we dey forced now to increase di price so we go remain in business odawise na die we dey and all do investment you don make go just waste,"" Onuorah tok. Onuorah say though dem dey consider di way things be for Nigerians so pipo still fit afford to buy bread, Di increase go follow di different sizes of bread, so di Jumbo size of bread wey be N800 fit increase to N1200 - N1500 and di sliced bread wey be N500 fit increase to N800 Dis na so dat breadmakers go still dey in business as di inflation don drastically reduce dia profit margin. ""If you look at all di increase in di materials, e don reach about 200% increment."" ""Between 2021 and now, we don get material increase of about 155% but we don increase bread price by only 7%."" ""Check di difference in cost of materials and di price of bread, all na make e be say we dey produce bread wey Nigerians fit see bread on top dia table chop."" ""But now things get to change for us to continue di read business,"" e tok. Four things wey go help di bread industry To help di bread making Industry, di PBAN President Emmanuel Onuorah give three things wey go help to include: Onuorah come tell Nigerians to hold goment to account to check di drastic increase in di price of food items as di inflation rate much. E come ask for understanding from di public so dem go adjust to di increase in di cost of bread."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-60942819

Mothers day quotes: Mother's Day 2022 dates and why pipo dey celebrate am plenti times	"Some Nigerians dey celebrate Mother's Day today, 27, March, 2022. Mother's Day na special day to honour di mama of di family, na day to honour motherhood, maternal bonds and di power of mothers for di society and e dey celebrated throughout di world. But pipo don argue say Mother's Day celebration na one of di most confusing celebrations for di world, especially for Nigeria. Wetin dey cause di confusion no be di celebration itself but di actual date of di event. Starting from February for every year, Happy Mother's day messages go don begin dey pop up, pipo go don begin dey send tribute to dia beloved mama. Na so di messages go flow enta March, April, May, August and some oda months of di year. Di confusion even grow wen Catholic and Anglican Church choose separate days to celebrate Mother's Day. Mother's Day celebration dey happun for more than 50 kontris across di world, but all kontris no dey celebrate am di same day. Di celebration dey fall for different days for many parts of the world and e depend on which part of di world you dey live or di one you like to follow. E dey important to know say Mother's Day wey dey most time fall on Sunday for some kontris get dia root for di traditional catholic and Anglican church where dem dey call am mothering Sunday. Mother's Day dates dey change every year because e dey related to di celebration of Easter Sunday wey also dey change because e dey follow di Lunar Calendar. For some kontris, Mother's Day celebration na every fourth Sunday of Lent. Mother's Day na unofficial event for Nigeria because goment no recognize am unlike oda kontris where goment official declare di day. How Mother's Day celebration take start dey traced to di times of di ancient Greeks, wey dey always do festivals to honour Rhea and Cybele, di mother of di gods. During di Middle Ages, e get custom wey dem get to allow wey don move comot from where dem born dem to go back go go visit their home or 'mother' churches, and their mothers, on di fourth Sunday of di Christian festival of Lent. Dat time e dey common for children to leave home go work when dem still dey young like 10 years old, so dis na opportunity for families to meet again. Dis become Mothering Sunday for Britain. Although UK dey call am Mother's Day, e no get any connection wit di American Mother's Day. For US, Mother's Day dey celebrated on di second Sunday of May each year. Di idea start for America when one woman Anna Jarvis hold one small memorial service for her own mother on 12 May 1907. Soon afta, most places for America begin dey observe di day and in 1914, di US president turn am to national holiday, wey dem go dey celebrate on di second Sunday of May. Lots of oda kontris dey celebrate Mother's Day at different times of di year as well. Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Nigeria and United Kingdom dey celebrate Mother's Day in di fourth Sunday of Lent - Meaning say dis year, 2022, Mother's Day for dem na Sunday, 27 March. Mother's Day 2022 for America na Sunday, 8 May. UK get different date dan America becos di date of Mother's Day for UK dey connected to Easter, wey dey change every year. UK, Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man and Nigeria all get di same date for Mother's Day. For Mexico and many parts of Latin America, dem dey celebrate Mother's Day on May 10th of each year.

Di duo pick demsef up from disappointing Afcon wey see Ghana concede five goals for group stage as dem finish bottom of Group C wit only one point.

Di graduate of philosophy na one of several hundred Africans, from kontris like Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and Algeria, wey say dem dey willing to take up arms for battle against Russia, partly to escape di hardship wey many young men dey face at home. ""We sabi say na war, no be childs play,"" im tell BBC. ""But to be soldier for Ukraine go dey beta dan to stay here. ""If dem fit allow me stay wen di war end, plus I be hero and fight an undeniable enemy."" Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba say about 20,000 volunteers from across di world don already apply to enlist. Dem come afta Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky beg di world for foreign fighters to ""come and stand shoulder to shoulder wit Ukraine pipo"". Di goment don temporarily reduce im visa requirements and offer equipment plus salary to pipo wit valid passport and military training. E no get any official confirmation say dem go allow foreign fighters stay for di kontri afta di war. Kereti Usoroh, na Nigerian wey dey live for Nigeria capital, Abuja, say wetin dey ginger am to volunteer no get anytin to do wit moni or citizenship. ""I dey already live comfortable life. If I want to go to Europe, I go do am through education, not war,"" di 29-year-old lawyer said. ""Dis na about bullying - injustice for one na injustice for all."" Dis na sentiment wey go totori di hearts of Ukraine diplomats and some days afta President Zelenksy begging, dozens of hopeful volunteers waka go Ukraine embassy for Abuja, wit ambitions of enlisting. But Ukrainian embassy for Nigeria - like for odas for Africa - gatz press pause as many goments for Africa no want dia kontri pipo to fight for Ukraine. ""Nigeria dey discourage di use of mercenaries anywia for world and no go tolerate di recruitment,"" Nigeria foreign ministry write for statement.

And Russia get support for Africa. E don expand im influence for di continent - especially militarily, by helping kontris like Central African Republic (CAR), Libya, Mali and Sudan fight rebels or Islamist militants.

Di 21-year-old, wey don dey work as emergency rescue worker for di Red Cross, don dey prepare to enlist as a combatant, as im don collect di necessary documentation, including letter of recommendation. ""I go straight di police station to collect my documents,"" im tok, explaining say clean criminal record na one of di requirements for enlisting.

But for na three dey popular pass for Nigeria according to Salahudeen Olalekan tell BBC Pidgin. Di three na; According to di alternative energy engineer e dey necessary for pipo to get solar panel or inverter. Battery inverter dey convert power to wey pipo fit use for dia devices for house. E say alternative energy dey easy to maintain but e dey expensive For inverters, ""1kva/12volts system wey be one battery system na like N350,000. 1.7kva to 3.5kva na 24volts wit two batteries and di cost na N550,000 while 5kva wey be 48v solar power system na N950,000."" Olalekan say di alternative power dey easy to maintain and e dey ""help pesin dey discipline on how to manage electricity. Solar power dey work by converting energy from di sun into power. Olalekan say solar panel also dey cost like di battery intverter. ""E need sun intensity to work well. Di electricity dey generate through di use of solar panels, wey get different size from residential rooftops to 'solar farms'. ""Di solar panel dey necessary to make di inverter work well especially if pesin dey live for wia light no stabel. ""Di solar panel don cost now sake of di high demand. panel for 250wts wey fit service 1,5kva battery na N50,000 for one and pesin need atleast two to fit get optimum service,"" e tok. Generator na machine wey dey provide electricity - di machine dey run on petrol or diesel-powered engine. Di alternative energy engineer say unlike inverter and solar panel, generator voltage no dey constant. According to Olalekan, ""generator good for those wey feel say inverter cost becos di money to set up inverter cost pass to buy generator. ""But di challenge be say say di running cost for generator, cost pass to get inverter."" Becos you go dey buy fuel steady and Nigeria currently dey face fuel scarcity palava wey don make di price of petrol go up. Dis no be di first time wey di national grid go collapse, For May 2021, di Nigeria electricity national grids bin collapse and some parts of di kontri don enta darkness.

Im say police bin don also tok say di suspect no get hand for di killing of Sofiat. Dem later adjourn di trial to 22 April, 2022. Court give order make dem return di oda three suspects for prison. Police say dem arrest dem for di early hours of Saturday 29th of January 2022 afta di Adatan divisional headquarters receive one information from di head of di community security guard. Di informate wey di Adatan divisional headquarters receive be say di suspect dey burn something wey dey suspected to be human head inside one local pot. Afta dem get dis informate, di DPO Adatan division, SP Abiodun Salau, quickly lead im detectives go di scene, wia dem arrest di three suspects. Police bin say di fourth suspect wey happun to be di boyfriend of di girl wey dem kill, escape.

Oftentimes, dis parts dey dey required by herbalists to make sacrifices wey go give dem power, wealth or even cure illness. But e no dey easy to prove say such sacrifices fit give pesin money or protection. Police and oda fraud agencies like Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission don increase dia work to go after pipo, mostly young boys wey dey into such. Unemployment be major challenge which most Nigerian youth dey face. Dis unemployment challenge create economic hardships give young people who dey look for get rich quick schemes to escape poverty. Dis be one of de reasons why ritual killings dey on de rise. ""Di misconception be say once dem use human blood do rituals, dis dey make de vodoo more potent,"" security analyst Nana Kwaku Bonsam talk BBC. Di implication be di needless killings to meet conditions of fetish priests of late."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-60766476

Russia don deploy at least 200,000 troops near Ukraine borders in recent months, and fears dey say di latest move mark di first step of a new invasion. Russia for a long time don stand against Ukraine move towards European institutions, both Nato and di EU. Now, Mr Putin dey claim say Ukraine na toy of di West and no ever be proper state anyway. E dey demand guarantees from di West and Ukraine say dem no go join Nato, one defensive alliance of 30 konties, and say Ukraine go demilitarise and become a neutral state. As a former Soviet republic Ukraine get deep social and cultural ties with Russia, and dem dey speak well-well dia, but ever since Russia invade for 2014 those relations don get K-Leg. Russia attacke Ukraine wen dem comot di pro-Russian president for early 2014. Di war for di east don claim more dan 14,000 lives since den.

But kontris wey officially recognise say dis group of pipo dey exist dey refer to dem as non-binary or odas. Meaning say dem no be man and dem no be woman. Dem get many different varieties of intersex and most times e dey hard to know from small pikin weda dem be man or woman until di pesin grow. Sabi pipo say one out of evri 2,000 pipo wey come world, one na intersex. But e hard to know exactly how many dey for Nigeria as many of dem dey hide who dem be, and parents wey get moni dey sharply go do surgery for dia pikin wen im small. Transgender na pesin wey identify imsef or im gender differently from di sex wey dem give am wen dem born am. Some transgender pipo wan to do surgery to change from one sex to anoda. But many odas prefer to dey as nature take create dem. Cisgender identity na pesin wey identify imsef or im gender di same as di sex wey dem give am wen dem born am."

Dia tok-tok pesin Debo Ologunagba tell BBC say ""if di production of local rice don increase, e for don show price ofr market"". Di most reliable numbers recently wey we find na di US Department of Agriculture, wey bin predict say Nigeria rice production go reach fie million tonnes for 2022. Di report show sat di production rate bin rise well-well between 2015 and 2017 and jump again for 2020. And while Nigeria goment show beta rise of rice production from 2015 and 2016, dem no get any dat a for di last few years. Di land wey dem dey plant di rice don increase. E increase from 3.1 million hectares (7.7 million acres) for 2015 to 5.9 million hectares for 2018, and then come drop again to 5.3 million hectares for 2020, wey be di latest numbers wey UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) get data for. Di goment don dey provide beta seeds and fertiliser give smallholder farmers and then sama more money for irrigating schemes. For 2014, dem start program wey go help farmers to fit rent machine dem so e go improve mechanisation of rice farming. In fact, some states dey give land concessions, wey mean special allowance to large scale farmers make dem take plant. For November 2015, di Central Bank of Nigeria start programme wey farmers fit get loans with beta interest rates, in fact, dem fit even pay back di loans with dia produce.

Kasala between herders and farmers for di north-west and central Nigeria for recent years don also affect prices on top say e pursue rice farmers comot dia farms. But e no clear how many farmers dey affect and how much land di kontri don lose on top insecurity. Even bad roads don also lead to why di prices dey high. On top all dat, US data show say Nigeria dey chop seven million tonnes for inside, so di kontri even still need additional two million tonnes of rice make equation balance. Because of di shortage between production and demand, Nigeria don dey import rice and sometimes na smuggling e dey take enta di kontri. Last month Oga Buhari say dem no dey import any rice and say di kontri even dey export di rce e dey produce. But official data no dey for di exports and we bin fit find from goment wetin be di evidence for di exportation of rice wey dem dey claim. As for imports, Nigeria bring restrictions for 2015 to boost local production we include: Even though goment say Nigeria no dey import rice, US report say Nigeria dey import reach two million tonnes for recent years.

Pipo wey dey pay rent for Nigeria fit stop to pay one year in advance	"To get decent place to live na difficult tin any wia, but to look for 12 months' rent wey pesin go pay in advance na extra burden wey millions of Nigerians dey face. Landlords prefer to collect plenty money upfront as e dey reduce di chance of tenants to default. E better to chase tenant once instead of to dey chase dem 12 times a year, na so dem reason am. But dis system dey about to change. Lawmakers dey debate one law to make yearly upfront rent illegal for Nigeria capital, Abuja, while authorities for di biggest city, Lagos, don choose di voluntary scheme wey go begin next month. Di Lagos state goment dey hope say by acting as a guarantor for di new payment system, landlord get fit begin accept monthly rents. Many residents, especially young pipo wey just dey start family like di idea of monthly rents. Tunde Omotayo, wey wan marry for April, dey face challenge of raising 600,000 to 800,000 naira ($1,500-$2,000; 1,000- 1,400) for ""decent apartment"" for mainland Lagos as e plan to move out of im friend house afta im wedding. For pesin wey dey on monthly salary of 300,000 naira di tin go hard am. ""I bin tink say my salary go fit easily take care of my rent but e shock me. At dis point, I no go mind to pay my rent monthly because as tins stand I dey confused,"" e tell di BBC. If e register for di new system e mean say im go pay about 50,000 naira a month, wey make am believe say di pressure go reduce as im wedding don near. As one of di world fastest-growing city, demand for housing for Lagos dey increase every day, and house no cheap. Two-bedroom apartment close to di city main business district, Victoria Island, go for between $11,000 and $22,000 a year while low-to-middle-income housing fit cost anywia between $500 and $5,000 for mainland. Na for di tenant to raise di money, and di majority of working-class Nigerians don get to master how to save money every month to pay di annual rent. Some of di pipo wey e no easy for to save dey borrow from loan sharks wit interest charges wey reach 28% per month, while a few odas dey collect no-interest loans from dia employers to cover di rent. Flat-sharing also dey popular for young middle-class pipo for Lagos so different pipo fit gather dia money togeda take pay di plenty annual rent. Many odas don move go into neighbouring Ogun state wia house rent dey cheap, but dem go need to travel long distance go work for Lagos. Pam Christopher, wey just move come Lagos from Jos, for central Nigeria wia rents cheap well-well, no believe di $2,400 rent wey landlord ask am to pay for two-bedroom apartment on mainland Lagos. ""House na gold here,"" e tell di BBC. ""I need di two-bed because I plan to move my family here and now e be like say I no go fit afford am,"" e tok. Im dey currently live wit im friend and e dey seriously hope for goment intervention, wey state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu say dem ""design to make pipo pay dia rents according to dia monthly salary"". But as businessman Tosin Emmanuel afta e reason di monthly payment discover say ordinary speech no go fit convince landlords for Lagos ""One landlord ask weda na goment buy am land and build di house for am. E say go goment fit determine how e go collect im rent. ""Di man say make I go meet [Governor] Sanwo-Olu to give me house,"" oga Emmanuel tell BBC. For di scheme to dey successful, di goment dey depend on di support of powerful landlords Lagos. But dat one go hard. ""Yearly rent no be wetin we suppose dey discuss because many house-owners depend on am for survival,"" landlord Ayem Ojie tell di BBC. Oga Ojie get house for Ikorodu, out of Lagos and say im an many oda house-owners build dia properties to fund dia retirement. ""Financial planning dey easy wen you collect di money in bulk,"" e tok. ""To maintain building demands bulk money, no be small-small,"" na so Lekan Ade wey get house for di middle-class Ilupeju area on di mainland tok. Demand for housing high pass supply by far for Lagos and di rental sector don become sellers' market, wia those wey get di property dey determine wetin tenants must do. Although goment say dem don build 14 public housing schemes since 2019, wia civil servant dey pay low rents, di house no still dey enough wey make private developers take over. Dem build wetin dem like and charge as dem want for dis sector wey dem no dey too regulate. But many tenants wey don already get house no dey too interested in changing di system. Nigerians dey used to pay upfront for things; cars, phones, school fees, and some mortgage facilities dey for those wey wan buy house. Adaobi Asuoha, wey dey live for di middle-class Ajah district of Lagos Island, prefer to pay her rent yearly as e allow her to fit use her money as she like for di rest of di year. ""Di monthly rental fee dey good but yearly payment dey comot di pressure from pesin body. Some months dey wen I fit need my entire money for something else,"" she tell di BBC. She dey gather her rent by saving some part of her salary everi month, Asuoha tok. Dis mindset of saving plenty money na a reflection of Nigerian culture of upfront payments, na so banker Kayode Omosebi tok. E believe say Nigerians no too sabi pay monthly bills or pay by instalment, and say pipo see rent as investment. ""For place wia job security and oda bills no dey guaranteed, pipo no wan joke wit dia shelter,"" e tok. If dem don pay for one year in advance, that na something wey dem no go need to worry about for anoda 12 months. Even di goment realise say dia ambitious monthly payment plan dey in the hand of di powerful landlords and fit dey dead on arrival. ""We know say we no fit enforce monthly rent collection on landlords,"" na so Toke Benson-Awoyinka, special adviser to di Lagos govnor on housing tok.

Soot in Port Harcourt: Wetin don hapun afta Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike declare war against kpo fire operators?	"One month afta Rivers state Govnor Nyesom Wike declare war against illegal crude oil bunkering and artisanal refining, as a way to stop di soot pollution wey pipo for di state dey suffer, local goment chairmen for di state don discover and destroy many illegal crude oil refining sites. For im new year message on 1, January, 2022, Governor Wike declare 19 alleged illegal oil bunkering kingpins wanted and direct traditional rulers and all di 23 local goment chairmen for di state to locate, identify and report to im office all those wey dey behind illegal bunkering and crude oil refining sites to in office for dia localities for prosecution. Two weeks later, di govnor bin declare total war against illegal crude oil bunkering afta im visit two sites for Ibaa, Emohua LGA and Ogbodo for Ikwerre LGA wia illegal crude oil bunkering dey go on and see di level of devastation e don cause di environment. Di govnor bin give 48 hours ultimatum to all di 23 local goment chairmen to submit di list of illegal crude oil bunkerers to am and e promise to give dem two million naira for evri new one dem discover. Local goment chairmen begin enter deep inside dia localities, across di riverine and upland areas to discover illegal crude oil bunkering and artisanal refining sites. Fotos and videos of dis sites dem from Ahoada East, Ahoada West, Bonny, Degema, Eleme, Oyigbo LGAs in addition to di ones for Emohua, Ikwerre, Port Harcourt and Obio Akpor LGA don flood social media since den. Asides from di pipo di govnor declare wanted, e no clear who else don cop arrest for di mata since di exercise start. Although reports say dem don arrest some pipo for some local goment areas. Wike accuse security operatives Governor Nyesom Wike also accuse security operatives say dem dey support and encourage illegal crude oil bunkering activities for di State. Sake of dis, di Commandant General of NSCDC, Ahmed Audi immediately disband di Anti-vandal unit for Rivers State and summon all di officers to NSCDC headquarters as dem begin investigate di allegation. Di Rivers State Police Command likewise redeploy di DPO di govnor accuse and set up panel to investigate di mata. 'Harm to di environment' One of di actions some of di local goment chairmen dey take na to set some illegal crude oil refining sites on fire or burst and burn di storage tanks wia dem store di illegally refined crude oil products dem discover. Dis dey cause serious concern among environmentalists as dem observe say such actions dey add to di destruction of di environment. Prof. Precious Ede of di Rivers State University say one way to handle dis na for dem to handover such products dem seize from illegal crude oil refining sites to agencies of goment like di Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC and Department of Petroleum Resource DPR, (wey now don become Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission) wey get di capacity to handle such products. Prof. Ede wey bin dey di committee wey di Rivers State goment put togeda to chook eye into wetin dey cause di black soot pollution for di state say part of dia recommendations afta dem identify wetin dey cause am, na for di state goment to get facilities wia dem go fit receive dis illegally refined products afta dem seize dem from di sites. E dey concerned about di sustainability of wetin di goment don start, ""e go still continue afta dis period or even afta im comot for office? E ask. Di one wey we dey see some of di LGA chairmen dey destroy some sites with fire or pour am for di environment no dey good because dis crude oil or petroleum products na hazardous products wey no good. So if di state goment get a proper plan and strategy, den dem go clearly define wia dem go keep all dis products instead of to go dey destroy am as e go destroy di environment in addition to wetin don already destroy as a result of di illegal refining activities. Im tok. Anoda environmentalist Rev. Nnimmo Bassey also express concern around di approach. Di problem with giving dis task to local goment chairmen be say, I no see how dem dey equipped to do di job and di mechanism dem go apply. But di mandate for dem to identify and destroy dey very disturbing because di illegal refineries for di bush na basic construction wey no need to dey destroyed because to destroy am na to create more harm to di environment and create more pollution to di forest, di creeks and swamps and e go take ages before dem fit repair di harm e go cause. Wetin I feel say di goment fit do na to send experts to go dis sites di local goment chairmen don identify go dismantle di basic contraptions dem build as refineries and collect di stored crude and products wey di refiners don steal and put dem for a place wia dem fit safely and properly dispose dem. Rev. Nnimmo Bassey tok. Di black soot pollution don stop? Di major reason why di Rivers State Governor declare dis war na to stop di black soot pollution wey pipo for di state don dey complain about since 2016. Govnor Wike bin observe say since di LGA chairmen begin go afta di illegal crude oil operators, di black soot pollution bin reduce small. But for some days especially between di 17 and 18 January, pipo across Rivers state bin still observe serious soot for di early morning hours and snap fotos wey cause some tok for social media."

You fit dey interested to watch dis video Mrs. Hannah Ejekwu say di Iria womanhood ceremony get three stages according to age: ""Di first one we dey call am Kala- Egerebite na for girls wey dey between di ages of 12 and 15 years. Di second one, Opu - Egerebite na for girls between ages 18 to 21."" ""Di third one na for older pipo wey don reach age 40 and above na im dey do dat ceremony. Dat one na Bighibite ceremony."" She explain say for di first stage, kala-egerebite, di girl go tie native wrapper wey dem dey call suu. She go tie dat one short, with coral beads. For di second stage, opu- egerebite she go tie one waist of Ikaki (akwete), Popo and Damask di soft one (Lo bite) with matching blouses. Then di last stage wey be Bighibite, she go tie di Awomie bite dat na di george dem dey dye. She say dat na di most important cloth and after dat she go tie lili-inji wey be intorica george. Hannah observe say if woman no do any of di stages as she dey grow till she become full adult, wen she dey do di Iria ceremony, she must do all di oda stages from di Kala Egerebite to di Bighibite. And di woman go tie all di different types of traditional wrapper dem complete, she add. ""For di tying of wrapper, e get di stage wey wen di girl dey young, she go tie one waist like wen she tie di Ikaki, Popo and Damask na only one she go tie with her blouse. Den di last stage wen she tie di Awu, den she fit begin tie di george wrapper and she go begin tie two waist wrapper with her blouse. If she never tie di Awomie bite, she no fit tie two pairs of di george wrapper, according to di woman. ""If she never do any of di stages before, wen she wan do di iria, we go follow all di stages one after di oda from di kala- Egerebite wia she go tie suu, to di opu-egerebite wia she go tie di ikaki, popo, Damask. ""To di third stage di Bighibite wia she go tie Awomie-bite and di lili-inji, dat is intorica george. She must do all till e complete. Then she dey free from embarrassment."" Di iria ceremony dey start wen di iriabo (di maiden turning into full woman) go go church with her parents and her pipo, according to wetin Hannah Ejekwu narrate. Di parents go inform dem say dem wan tie dia pikin wrapper. Dat day she go dress well buy she go tie her wrapper short with matching blouse and headtie to do am. Then dem go follow dem come house. Di second stage, Hannah say dem dey call am 'Wari so', dat na to enter di fattening room. Dia dem go rub di Iriabo white chalk, rub her palm oil, turmeric to make her body fine and her skin to glow. Dem go also draw beautiful patterns for her body to decorate her and give her good food, feed her well so she go fat, dey shine so wen she come out pipo go admire and see say she fine well well. And dat one dey also attract potential husband to come ask for her hand in marriage. Mrs. Ejekwu say to stay for di fattening dey depend on how di iriabo want am. ""Wen me I do my own, na three months I stay inside di fattening room but nowadays, di girls no dey fit stay because of school and work. ""Some no wan fat so some dey stay one week, some two weeks before dem come out. ""Di third and last stage na di one dem go dress her di wrapper one after di oda starting wit Ikaki (Akwete), di Popo, di Damask (di soft one dem dey call Lo bite) and di wrapper dem call Awu dat na cooked wrapper, di george dem go dye am. Dis na di biggest wrapper for Ibani kingdom. Wen she don tie dat cloth, she don enter inside george (bighibite). Now she fit tie george - all di different types of george wrapper weda na plain george, intorica, dat is di senior george wrapper. Dis na di last stage. Di following day Sunday, di iriabo with her parents and family pipo go go church again go do thanksgiving to thank God for a successful iria ceremony."" After dat di Iriabo dey expected to tie complete two pairs of wrapper with head tie, dress properly as a full Ibani woman anytime she dey come out for at least one year. Some pipo dey do for six months too. But going forward anytime she dey attend any occasion for Ibani kingdom or she dey attend occasion wey any Ibanise pesin dey do be it marriage, chieftaincy or any gathering of Ibanise, she dey expected to dress complete with two wrapper. She fit tie two waist of any of di traditional wrappers and dem go recognize her. Mrs Hannah Ejekwu emphasize say woman wey never do dis iria ceremony no fit tie two waist George wrapper or any of di traditional wrappers waka for street for Ibani kingdom. Dis according to her, na because dem go comot one of di wrapper from her. ""Women wey never do iria go tie only one wrapper, she no go tie two. If she no know herself come tie two wrapper, women wey don do iria go confront her, comot one of di wrapper from her waist. ""And question why she dey tie two wrapper wen she never do iria and dem go seize dat wrapper. Dat na big disgrace."" ""If you go out now for wia dem dey dance, you go see say those young young girls, na only one wrapper dem tie"" Dis na ""because dem never do iria, but di one wey don do iria, dem tie di two pairs of wrapper - up and down, dress well wit better head tie."" She add say woman wey never do iria no fit tok wia women gada because dem go shut her up and walk her out. ""As she never tie wrapper, she no get say for wia we dey so dem go walk her out."" Hannah add say Ibani Se [Ibani pipo] hold dis tradition very high and recently, dem don make am an important requirement for women wey wan contest election or hold political office. She must be pesin wey don do her iria ceremony so dat she go get say and command di respect of di community, Hannah add. As e pertain to marriage, she explain say tying of wrapper na di first tin a woman suppose do before she marry. Dis na because di tradition na say wia women wey don tie wrapper gada sidon, weda she don marry or not, if she never do iria, she no go fit tok wia dem dey. She no fit appear before dem for Ibani-Se. Also, wen man come to marry Ibani daughter wey never do di Iria ceremony, di family for also demand di Iria as dowry wey be say di man go promise to do di Iria ceremony for her. So di family go always look forward to di time I'm go fulfil dat promise to honor dia daughter. But originally na tradition parents dey do for dia girl pikin to cover her nakedness and show say she don mature. Sake of di big wrappers, jewellery and accessories wey dey involved in iria ceremony, many pipo say Iria na very expensive ceremony. But Mrs. Hannah Ejekwu say e no dey as expensive as dem assume, e depends on how di pesin want am. ""Dis tying of wrapper na how you want am na im you go do am, e no too cost. If you get money you want do am big you do am like dat."" ""You no get money you wan do small, you do am like dat too but di main tin na say you don do am, so do as your power reach. ""E dey like wedding, some pipo dey do am society wedding invite plenti pipo, some dey do am small too but di tin be say dem don marry. ""Na so e be. But some pipo want dance and invite pipo, celebrate big and so dem dey keep am tay till dem don old, wen dem get money. Na dia choice."" Dis woman wey dey narrate di tori stress say dis ceremony dey so important dat if Ibani woman no do am wen she dey alive, wen she die her family must do am for her before dem bury her for Ibani land. ""If because she no get money, she no do dis iria and she die, her parents [pipo] go do di ceremony for her deadbody as dem lie am for bed; Na so dem go put all di wrapper dem for her body one by one dey remove am wit di blouses to match. So evribodi want to do am wen dem dey alive. Even if she die for London, dem bring di deadbodi come back but she never tie wrapper. Dem must do di ceremony on di deadibody before dem put am for ground bury."" Anoda thing na say, if a Bonny girl marry man wey from anoda place, she must also do di iria ceremony. Likewise for Ibani man wey marry woman from anoda tribe, for her to seat among women for di land, im go also do di iria ceremony for im wife too for her to be a full fledged Bonny woman. Anoda misconception wey pipo dey get about di Iria ceremony according to Mrs Hannah Ejekwu na say iria ceremony dey fetish and e dey associated with juju, but she say no be so. She say dis don discourage some pipo not to do di ceremony because dem no wan get anything to di with juju but she say e no dey like dat because as dem dey carry out di processes. Dem no dey invoke any ancestral spirits or pour libation, rather na prayers dem dey pray and at di end, di iriabo dey go do thanksgiving for church. Oda Ibanise nations like Opobo and Andoni for Rivers State also dey do di iria Egerebite and Bighibite womanhood ceremonies although with slight differences in di way dem dey do di rite of passage. Even di Okrikas and Kalabaris also dey do iria ceremony to honour and celebrate womanhood. Mrs Hannah Ejekwu come advise young Ibanise girls to keep di iria tradition because e dey bring honour and respect to womanhood. And e dey show di high place di society put women as e go give dem recognition and opportunity for dem to contribute meaningfully to develop dia community."

Nigeria government declare bandits as terrorists - See wetin fit hapun next	"Federal Goment of Nigeria don officially declare bandit groups wey dey operate for any parts of di kontri as terrorists. Di declaration dey inside di Federal Goment Gazette wey ban and forbid dia existence and stop any pesin or group of pesins from participating inside activities of any of di groups. Dem release di official Gazette wey di Attorney General of di Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, sign on Wednesday 5th January, 2022. Dis one dey come afta di Federal High Court for Abuja, Nigeria ruling wey declare bandit groups as terrorists. For inside di ruling wey Justice Taiwo Taiwo deliver on Friday, 27, November 2021, di court say di activities of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta'adda bandit groups, na acts of terrorism. Di ruling follow di ex parte motion wey di Federal Goment of Nigeria bin file through di Federal Ministry of Justice. Di Gazzette say di activities of Yan Bindiga Group, Yan Ta'adda Group and oda similar group for Nigeria dey declared as terrorism and dey illegal for any part of Nigeria especially for di North West and North Central regions of di kontri dey proscribed according to sections 1 and 2 of di Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011.

Security Sabi pesin, Rtd Col Hassan Stan-Labo say goment declaring bandit for di kontri na game changer for di fight against di bandit. E say by dis pronouncement, di military don get authorization to use lethal weapon like A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets wey dem acquire from di United States last year. E further explain say di US goment bin place some restriction on how Nigeria go use di fighter jet sake of concerns of human rights abuse and sake of dis restriction, di military no fit use di jet to bomb di hideout of di bandits like dem dey for north east but now wey dem don declare dem as terrorist, di security go now go very tough on di bandits. Di Super Tucano na dual-pilot turboprop aircraft wey dem build as workhorse combat air platform - e dey equipped for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and for precision air-to-ground strike missions. Nigeria get 12 of dis aircraft but oga Stan-Labo say make security no treat di bandit wit kid glove and dat make dem bombard dem and finish dem for Naija within di coming months. Bandits don dey operate for north west and north central Nigeria. Dem dey kidnap for ransom and attack villages and kill- kill pipo. Sake of dis, some govnors for north west like di Kaduna state Govnor, Nasir El-rufai bin call make di military bomb dia base.

Di armed bandits wey dey mostly operate out of abandoned forest reserves dey terrorise and attack communities for di kontri north-west region. Dem be di latest groups to join Nigeria kidnap for ransom industry. In di last ten years, more dan 8,000 pipo don die in di states of Kebbi, Sokoto, Niger and Zamfara, according to di International Crisis Group. Di attacks fit dey traced to years of competition over resources between ethnic Fulani herders and farming communities. Meanwhile, controversial Islamic cleric Sheikh Gumi bin don condemn di Federal High Court ruling wey grant di Federal Goment of Nigeria request to name bandits as terrorists for di kontri say e no go get head. ""Declaring di herdsmen banditry as terrorists na just a decision wey dem take for political purpose. E no go get any practical value because even before di declaration, dem bin dey fight and treat dem as terrorists. So na just nomenclature wey I believe say no go change di dynamics on ground. If you fit remember, IPOB, dem also declare am as terrorist organisation, di declaration even dey backed by di order of di Court but as you fit see, even di international community no recognize FG declaration of IPOB.

Black Axe: Leaked documents shine spotlight on secretive Nigerian gang	"One violent mafia-style gang for Nigeria wey dey linked to murder and fraud don penetrate di kontri political system and launch global scamming operation beyond Nigeria borders, according to thousands of hacked documents and testimonies wey di BBC see. Di ""Black Axe"" gang don dey operate for many years in Nigeria and dey among di kontri most-feared organised crime syndicates. Membership of dis syndicates, wey dey known as ""cults"" or ""fraternities"", dey outlawed for Nigeria. For di past two years, BBC Africa Eye don dey follow di Black Axe, dem speak to former members and look through thousands of documents wey look like say dem hack dem from some top members of di group. E no dey possible to verify di entire tin, but BBC verify key documents inside. Among our findings be emails wey suggest say one prominent Nigerian businessman and 2019 APC party candidate for political office, Augustus Bemigho, wey be senior member of Black Axe dey involved in orchestrating fraudulent internet scams and netting millions of dollars. Di documents dem contain more dan 18,000 pages from one email account wey dey linked to Mr Bemigho, including emails wey suggest say e send guidance on scamming to one network of collaborators on 62 occasions and bin communicate wit odas about specific scamming targets. ""We don remove im close to 1M dollar,"" one email wey dem send to Mr Bemigho tok, e dey refer to one victim. Di email contain di victim full name, email address and number, and instructions on how to progress di scam. BBC bin use Mr bemigho emails to track down two scamming, wey say dem defraud dem of reach like $3.3m ( 2.4m). Operations by international law enforcement agencies indicate say Black Axe scamming profits fit run into billions. BBC contact Mr Bemigho, but e no respond to di allegations. Some of di material wey dey di leaked documents wey show di graphic results of di gang activities dey too bad to publish. But di data paint unique picture of Black Axe operations between 2009 and 2019, and suggest say di gang don penetrate Nigerian politics for im home region of Edo State to shocking extent. Two documents state say for Benin City, 35 million naira ($85,000; 64,000) na im dey channel to di Neo-Black Movement of Africa (NBM) - one registered company for Nigeria wey dey considered by some western law enforcement to dey synonymous wit Black Axe - to ""protect votes"" and secure victory for one govnorship election in 2012.

""NBM no be Black Axe. NBM no get anytin to do wit criminality,"" Ese Kakor, di president of di organisation, tell BBC. But international law enforcement agencies no see am like dat. Di US justice department don label di NBM ""criminal organisation"" and say e dey ""part of di Black Axe"", and Canadian authorities don tok say Black Axe and NBM ""be di same"". For recent months, joint operations wey dey target Black Axe by di US Secret Service, di FBI and Interpol bin result for di arrest of more dan 35 NBM members for US and South Africa wey get charges wey dey related to multi-million dollar internet fraud schemes. NBM tell di BBC say dem don suspend all dis members since. For 2017, Canadian authorities break up one money-laundering scheme wey dey linked to Black Axe wey worth in excess of $5bn, e point finger to di scale of di gang global financial operations.

Omicron: Why Nigeria dey di travel red list?	"Nigeria dey UK travel red list - move wey United Kingdom goment tok say go help slow di spread of di Omicron variant. But di Nigeria High Commissioner to London, Ambassador Sarafa Tunji Isola say di travel restrictions na ""travel apartheid"". So why Nigeria dey di red list, and e dered list 1y fair? Wetin be red list? Nigeria na di latest African kontri to join UK travel red list - wit South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Di only pipo wey dey allowed to enta UK from dis kontris na UK or Irish citizens, or UK residents. Pipo wey arrive from red list kontris go need to enta hotel quarantine - wit dia own moni - and isolate for 10 days. Dem dey target dis kontris sake of Omicron variant wey dem first identify for southern Africa. But di fact say all di kontris wey currently dey di list na from Africa, don dey criticised as ""wicked and unfair"". Di decision to put kontri for dis list dey based on risk assessments from di Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) - one scientific body wey dey advise goment. Dis assessment include: Di UK goment tok say dem add Nigeria to di list be say: Di JBC report summarise informate wey dem use make specific decision for each kontri, but dem neva publish di one for Nigeria. UK goment statement wey announce Nigeria addition to di red list said ""majority"" of Omicron variant cases for UK ""get clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria"". Reported Covid cases for Nigeria dey far lower compared wit most of Europe, wia dem dey identify around 90 cases a day ova di past week - but testing for Africa dey way below Europe levels. During di last week of November, Nigeria do about 0.07 tests per 1,000 pipo a day, as dem compare am wit about 14 per 1,000 for UK and about 8 per 1,000 for France. Nigeria still identify fewer cases per test for week wey enta 2 December dan several oda European kontris plus South Africa wia dem first detect Omicron. Based on test mata, all kontris dey collect and share data differently and dis dey make am tricky to compare internationally. UK goment collect data on pipo wey test positive for Covid afta dem arrive UK. Di latest informate or data wey we get from di beginning of November, wey show percentage of pipo wey test positive afta dem travel from Nigeria dey around 1% - similar to several European kontris. Nigerian Centers for Disease Control (NCDC) don identify only three cases of Omicron for di kontri, all of dem dey linked to travel from South Africa. Dis na fewer cases dan several European kontris, including UK wia dem don report 336 Omicron cases. However NCDC data dey five days old, so di numbers fit don go up since. Genome sequencing - di process wey dem dey use to identify variants of virus - no dey advanced for Nigeria compared wit UK or South Africa, for example. Dis fit mean say dem no fit effectively tell di extent of di spread of Omicron. Di genome sequencing wey dem need to identify new variants dey very sophisticated and e rare. Di Department of Health say for England, 21 Omicron cases get link to travel from Nigeria. Kontri vaccination rate na also wetin dem dey consider before restricting travel, although dis na just ""contextual information"" plus genome sequencing ability and Covid transmission. Vaccination rates for Africa dey well below di world average. For Nigeria, as of 5 December, na just 4.8 doses dem don give per 100 people, compared with more than 178 per 100 people for UK."

Dem institutionalise am for 1977, under di regime of General Olusegun Obasanjo wit di promulgation of di Price Control Act wey make am illegal for some products (including petrol) to dey sold above di regulated price. Between 2006-2018 Nigeria spend about 10 trillion Naira on petroleum subsidies. Since Nigeria transition to civilian rule for 1979, many administrations and regimes don try to comot subsidy. President Shehu Shagari bin raise di price of petrol in 1982, from 15.3 kobo a litre to 20 kobo. For 1986 President Ibrahim Babangida announce partial removal of oil subsidies, which see petrol price increase from 20 kobo to 39 kobo per litre.

For June 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari administration tok say dem sef go remove fuel subsidy as dem follow give approval to di Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency to remove di price cap wey dey for petrol. But by March 2021, di government say dem go keep di price di smae even as price of crude dey jump up - which mean say fuel subsidy still dey occur for Nigeria."

Rivers State goment don open investigations into di causes of fire outbreaks inside di state following di fire for Bonny Jetty Port Harcourt last Monday. Di state Commissioner for Special Duties reveal dis after inspection of di areas affected by fire inside Port Harcourt. Emeka Onowu say Govnor Nyesom Wike don order say a panel of inquiry gatz dey set up to torchlight di three fire incidents. Federal Fire Service don fight 26 fire incidents (excluding Monday fire for Bonny-Bille-Nembe Jetty) in Port Harcourt and its environs from September 2021 to date. And dis fire outbreaks according to TheTide local tori pipo don lead to loss of properties worth billions of naira. D-Line fire Di first fire disaster happen for Isiokpo Street D/line on Saturday night 20 November, 2021 from one abandoned warehouse wia dem store alleged illegally refined petroleum products. Di fire come spread, burn down oda buildings and warehouses for Isiokpo and Kaduna streets for D/Line axis of Port Harcourt.

HPV vaccine: How e dey protect against cervical cancer and who fit receive am	"New research don discover say HPV vaccine fit reduce cases of cervical cancer by nearly 90%. Cervical cancer na di fourth most common cancer wey dey affect women around di world. E dey kill more than 300,000 each year. HPV ( na short for Human Papillomavirus). Na di name for a very common group of viruses. There are more than 100 different types of HPV and infections no usually dey cause any symptoms - although e get some types wey dey cause warts. E fit appear on your hand, foot, genitals or inside your mouth. Most pipo no dey know if dem dey infected and their bodies go fight di virus without treatment. High-risk types of HPV, on di other hand, fit cause abnormal tissue growth wey fit lead to cancers. Di HPV vaccine - also dey known as Gardasil - e dey protect against nine types of HPV. Dem include two wey dey cause nearly all cases of cervical cancer, those wey dey cause most anal cancers, plus some genital and head and neck cancers. Studies don show say di vaccine dey protect against HPV infection for at least 10 years. Although sabi pipo dey expect di protection to last much longer. Di first major study tok say e dey very effective, as e dey cut cases of cervical cancer by nearly 90%. Di research dey published for Lancet, e study wetin happun afta di vaccine dey introduced to girls for England for 2008. Di HPV vaccine dey work best if girls and boys collect am before dem come in contact wit HPV. Dis na because di vaccine fit only prevent infection, e no fit clear di body from di virus once pesin don catch am. Di viruses dey spread and fast. For di vaccine to work, children suppose don dey immunised against am before dem become sexually active. HPV dey easy to get as e dey very contagious, and e dey spread by close skin-to-skin contact. Up to 80% of pipo dey exposed to HPV by di age of 25. In most cases pipo dey-dey infected for 18 months to two years. Technically, e no be sexually transmitted disease, as e no dey spread by sexual fluids, like gonorrhoea. However most times pipo dey catch am during sexual contact, including touching. Almost 90% of cervical cancer deaths dey for low- and middle-income kontris according to di World Health Organization (WHO). For dis countries, dem no dey quick no say na cervical cancer until e don reach advanced stage and symptoms don develop. Last year, di WHO bin announce plans to eliminate di disease ""within di next century"" by achieving 90% coverage for HPV vaccination by 2030. Over one hundred kontris now don dey introduced HPV vaccination. However, as of 2020, less than 25% of low-income and under 30% of lower middle-income countries n aim don introduce di vaccine, compared wit high-income kontris wey don get up to 85% vaccination. Cervical cancer dey develop for woman cervix. Cervix na di entrance to di uterus from di vagina. Certain strains of di human papillomavirus (HPV) na im dey cause am. Na big health challenge for women for Africa. Cervical cancer na di second most common cancer among women for Africa. E also be di deadliest according to WHO. Cervical cancer dey progress slowly from di precancer stage to invasive cancer. E dey curable if dem diagnose am and treat am early. Di worse thing na say dis type of cancer na one of di most preventable but poor access to prevention, screening and treatment contribute to 90% of deaths. Rwanda be one of di first kontris for Africa to introduce accination campaign. E launch one plan for 2011 wey go make dia girls et di vaccine early and to introduce cervical screening for women. For di first year, e reach nine out of di 10 girls wey dey eligible for di vaccine, result wey experts cite as model for other kontris. However, HPV vaccine rates remain low even for some developed kontris. Dis na sake of misinformation say e fit cause infertility. Currently, less than 0.1% of eligible Japanese women don get di vaccine. Dem go give two injections for di upper arm spaced at least six months apart. According to di NHS, children wey miss di HGV vaccine in Year 8 go fit collect am di next academic year. All young pipo fit collect di vaccine for free for NHS until their 25th birthday. Yes. Although di vaccine show say e dey reduce di chances of developing cervical cancer, e no dey protect against all types of HPV. So e dey important say women get regular cervical smears once dem reach di age of 25."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-59166476

However, pipo gatz dey careful wit some greener products, as some no dey usable wit most condoms as dem dey cause breakage. And before making any decisions around contraception, e dey advised say you speak to a doctor or family planning professional. Sex toys na another area wey dey use more of plastic. Although steel or glass alternatives dey available, also to buy di rechargeable toys go also helps reduce waste. Solar powered sex toys also dey for market. Companies like LoveHoney dey offer sex toy amnesty, dem dey help recycle old and broken toys wey no fit go through typical recycling routes. Di part of our sex lives wey we fit change to reduce waste no too plenty. But to buy correct underwear and clothes, stop dey do kerewa for bathroom, to reduce di hot water, off lights plus choose to wear second hand cloth na ways to reduce our impact on di planet. Like most things we buy, packaging dey often lead to waste. Lauren Singer, one entrepreneur and zero-waste influencer from New York, say dis na where most companies fit make a difference. Condoms, lube and daily contraceptive pills na products wey fit generate packaging wey go end up for landfills. IUDs (intrauterine devices) and implants na longer-term contraceptive options wey get less waste but get their own risks. Lauren dey live almost entirely waste-free and since 2012, she dey collect anything wey she no fit recycle inside jar. You no go see condoms for Lauren jar as na di only contraception wey dey strong against STIs, she dey ask all her sexual partners to dey tested before she sleep wit dem. Dis don bring us to another point where sex and di environment collide - having children. According to one 2017 study, to stop dey use cars dey save about 2.3 tonnes of carbondioxide one year, while sticking to a plant-based diet dey save 0.8 tonnes. To compare dem together - if you dey live for developed world and you choose not get pikin, e go save about 58.6 tonnes per year. Di carbon footprint for less developed countries dey low lower, to get child for Malawi dey estimated say e no fit pass 0.1 tonnes. Some influential figures don tok how dem feel about having children. Prince Harry bin tell Vogue for 2019 say im and di Duchess of Sussex go get ""maximum"" of two children, e cite di environment as key factor for dis decision. Similarly, US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bin tok for di C40 World Mayors' Summit for 2019 say she be ""woman wey dreams of motherhood get bittersweet taste for her sake f wetin she now sabi wbout di children future"". Birth rates don reduce for many countries across di world. "	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-59055349

Sexual harassment amendment in Nigeria: Sexual harassment bill sponsor speak on im target	"Nigeria National Assembly recently pass di Sexual Harassment Bill 2020 (SB 77) as amended. And di amendment mainly address di sexual harassment of students wey dey higher institutions. Senator Ovie Omo-Agege wey sponsor di bill on di floor of di Senate tell BBC Pidgin say; Di main reason wey di National Assembly decide to amend di bill na to ""try to fill dis lacuna wey dey di existing law. ""We consider say while rape, wey be sexual intercourse wit one of di opposite sex without consent dey provided for for di criminal code, wey dem dey use for south and penal code wey dem dey use for north, e get issue wey e no address wey concern students for higher education and dia lecturer."" According to Nigeria law, if lecturer sleep wit student wey dey less dan 18 years, weda she give consent or not, di Nigeria law say dat na rape becos di pesin na underage. But before now di law no consider wetin e go do if lecturer force im female student to sleep wit am. For dis situation Senator Omo-Agege say, although di two of dem suppose be consenting adults, ground no level between di two becos di lecturer get authority over her. ""Pipo dey say becos she already be adult, notin like rape. ""But wey say dat, becos of di special relationship, relationship of coercion or threat, between di lecturer and di student, we dey say make dis law treat di female student as if she dey underage. ""And no get di power to willingly give consent or permission sake of di power wey di lecturer get ova di student."" Fear, don make many female students for Nigeria higher institutions to agree to sexual relationship wit dia lecturers. Usually di fear be say if she no agree, she go pay di price and she fit end up spending more years dan e dey necessary to graduate or pass di course. Therefore, dis bill dey clearly say, as long as you be lecturer, you no get any right to enta sexual relationship wit a female student wey be your student. If you want, you fit wait for her to graduate to have di relationship but as long as she na student, notin for you. Di National Assembly recommend make di punishment be 14 years for prison. For 2019, Nigeria lawmakers move for di amendment of di Sexual Harassment Bill. All di stakeholders agree except di Academic staff Union of Universities (ASUU). ASUU oppose di bill on argument say di bill dey against legal principles becos universities dey autonomous and fit take care of dia own affairs. Dem believe say di law dey target di character of teachers for higher institutions. But Senator Omo-Agege say, dis bill no cari anybody for mind. ""We must understand say for every part of society we get good pipo and bad pipo, di law dey target bad pipo, dey target bad lecturers."" Di senator tok. Dem also argue say di bill no include primary and secondary school. But di tin be say students of primary and secondary schools dey mostly below di age of 18 years so dia mata dey under statutory rape. Di penalty for anyone wey fail dis law na up to 21 years in prison. Read di full details of di sexual harassment bill here. Di bill wey pass third reading on di floor of di House of Representatives one week ago, dey concurrent and now e dey wait to go di president table for assent."

And dem agree say dem do wrong, however many pipo still dey wonder weda dat kind punishment na according to Islamic laws. Khamr na di Arabic word for wine, liquor or intoxication. For Islam, e mean certain forbidden substances, and im technical definition depend on di legal school. Most jurists, including di Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Ahl-i Hadith legal schools don traditionally view am as general term for anytin wey dey intoxicate. Dis include things made from grapes, dates, and similar substances and to drink am no dey allowed for di religion. E dey reported say, di Holy Prophet of Islam say every intoxicant na khamr, and every intoxicant dey forbidden. Di Quran no prescribe any specific penalty for drinking alcohol. Di Quran say wen ''dem ask you about wine (khamr) and gambling. Say, ""In dem na great sin and [yet, some] benefit for pipo. But dia sin dey greater pass dia benefit"" Qur'an 2:219. ""O you wey acknowledge, Do not go near prayer, (Salat) wen you no fit think well (under influence), until you know wetin you dey tok'' Qur'an 4:43. O you wey don believe, indeed, intoxicants (khamr), gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars [to other than God], and divining arrows be defilement from di work of Satan, so avoid am so you go dey successful Qur'an 5:90. And for hadith, di only reference for punishment bin come from di one by Anas ibn Malik. E bin report say Prophet Muhammad bin prescribe 40 lashes ""wey go dey administered wit two palm branches... for someone wey chop accuse say e drink alcohol"". According to scholar Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid of Saudi Arabia, di join body of classical Islamic scholars of fiqht for di punishment sake of pesin drink alcohol be flogging. But scholars no reach agreement for di number of lashes wey dem go sama di drinker. ""Many scholars bin reason say na eighty lashes for free man"" and forty for slaves and women. Islamic scholars wey follow BBC pidgin tok share similar opinion on di matter. Sheik Sayyid Musa Aloba from Ilorin, for Kwara State say e no dey right for any teacher to beat students like dat. Di popular scholar add say ''all schools whether western or religious dey try discipline students wen dey commit offence. But no be say make pipo gather dey beat one person, dat kind tin no good, Aloba add. But any offence wey don dey big suppose go through di right authority and follow due process, e tok. Dr Jabir Sani Maihula, di Head of Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies Sokoto State University for im own contribution say: E say any offence wey dey related to drinking of alcohol no be matter for unconstituted authority to judge. Dis na as e get process wey only Judge for Sharia court or fi court of law fit carry out. Di scholar add say although no quranic injunction on how many lashes pesin fit give. Nigerian schools dey try discipline students wey commit offence by flogging but di flogging must dey moderate without passing boundary. Di two scholars agree say di tradition for Nigerian schools na to flog students wey commit offence. But no school authority or parents get right to carry out severe punishment. For inside one video wey enter BBC Pidgin domot, di Misbaudeen Islamiyah authority bin address di students. Dem say dem no dey happy wit wetin happen as since wen dem don dey do good e no enter public domain. Di teacher wey tok tell di students say dia intention na to make dem better pipo as dey all come from different states and wetin dia parent want na make dem become better. E add say many pipo wey dey comment no sabi wetin happen. E say na di parents of students wey commit offence bin call dia attention to di video of how di students dey drink alcohol plus do oda bad tins for social media and na sometin wey no sweet dia belle. Di teacher say dem no be wicked pipo and dem no dey beat. E say some parents don promise di islamiyah authority say dem dey ready to follow di matter go anywhere as na dia wish make dem punish dia children. Di teacher bin urge pipo to dey try confam details of any tin before dem go fit judge di matter."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-58861219

Roe v Wade: Politico leak suggest Justice Alito want SCOTUS to overturn abortion rights	"US Supreme Court fit dey about to overturn di nationwide legal right to abortion, leaked report suggest. Dis na according to one leaked draft opinion wey don make activists to enta streets of Washington. Politico, tori pipo, reports say Justice Samuel Alito don write di document say di landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision dey ""badly wrong"". If Politico reports dey verified, di leaking of di document fit be wetin never happun before inside di US Supreme Court modern history. Di justices dey expected to issue dia ruling on di case by early July. Neither di Supreme Court or di White House wish to comment on di leak on Monday night. ""Roe dey egregiously (badly) wrong from di start,"" di draft opinion reportedly tok. Di opinion add say: ""Time don reach to obey di Constitution and return di issue of abortion to di pipo elected representatives."" Justice Alito also reportedly write say Roe v Wade reasoning bin dey ""exceptionally weak"" and e don get ""damaging consequences"". ""Di conclusion wey dey difficult to notice na say a right to abortion no dey deeply rooted in di Nation's history and traditions,"" di conservative opinion reportedly tok. Speaker of di House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer - both Democrats - don issue a joint statement reacting to di leak. ""If di report dey accurate, di Supreme Court dey ready to inflict di greatest restriction of rights in di past 50 years"", di statement read. E add say di decision by ""Republican-appointed Justices"" go-go down as an ""abomination, one of di worst and most damaging decisions in modern history"". One of America main anti-abortion organisations, National Right to Life, say e go wait for di Supreme Court official opinion on di matter before speaking out. Anti-abortion activists and pro-abortion supporters don already take to di streets of Washington to demonstrate. Dis be after news say U.S. Supreme Court fit overturn di 1973 Roe v Wade ruling wey legalized abortion nationwide. A woman right to do an abortion through di first trimester of pregnancy na im dey protected nationally in 1973. E follow di Supreme Court landmark 7-2 ruling in Roe v. Wade case. If Supreme Court of United States [SCOTUS] do wetin dey di leaked Politico report, e mean say dat right of a woman don get K-leg. Immediately, sake of statutes wey already dey books and ""trigger"" laws wey dem design for such occasion - abortion go dey illegal in 22 states of USA. Now abortion rights supporters in Washington don call on Democrats inside Congress to take action to protect access to abortion. Experts say di leak of a U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion wey fit overturn di constitutional right to abortion na major breach of confidentiality. Reports say e don heightened di stakes ontop di already politically-charged case inside America. Plaintiff Jane Roe, wey later dey identified as Norma McCorvey na unmarried pregnant woman wey no fit an abortion under Texas law. Fo dia e dey illegal unless to save di life of di mother. Roe lawyers said she dey unable to travel out of di state to obtain an abortion and argue say di law no dey real and block on her constitutional rights. ""Pregnancy dey often come more than once to di same woman, and in di general population, if man go survive, e go always be with us."" Na so Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a Republican wey by President Richard Nixon nominate, write inside di sweeping majority opinion. SCOTUS decision rule say Texas law infringed on women right to privacy, e dey overly broad and violate di due process clause inside U.S. Constitution Fourteenth Amendment. ""Dis right of privacy...dey broad enough to encompass a woman decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. ""Di bad condition say di State go impose upon di pregnant woman by denying dis choice altogether dey clear. Five Republican-nominated judges dey among di majority. Di court rule say di state fit regulate di procedure during di second trimester and even ban am in most circumstances in di third. Justices Byron White, a Democratic appointee, and Republican-nominated William Rehnquist, later U.S. chief justice, no agree to di ruling alias dissented. Di decision provoke gbasgbos among social and judicial conservatives, wey for long don dey make move to revoke am. Assume for a moment say dis draft opinion become law of di land. Immediately, sake of statutes wey already dey books and ""trigger"" laws wey dem design for such occasion - abortion go dey illegal in 22 states of USA. Di illegality of di procedure go become battle during election year. Dis na di significance of wetin dey happun for Supreme Court. However, draft opinions na just draft opinions. And accounts of justices wey don shift dia views as di opinion-drafting process dey go on within di court chambers. Dis kind leak bypass all dat. For most of US history, di Supreme Court don operate like Mount Olympus as dem dey hand down opinions from high. Dis leaking wey dey spread don shatter dis kind tin. Pipo gass wait to see wetin e go mean for di legitimacy of di judicial process for US. But inside di institution, e no go dey wrong to say all trust between di judges don disappear. Inside era wey political customs don dey broken, anoda big piece don fall. Na Republican presidents appoint six of di nine current justices of di court. Na Democratic presidents pick di three odas. Politico report suggest say Justice Alito and four oda justices wey Republican appoint - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - support di move. E no dey clear how Chief Justice John Roberts go vote. Di three justices wey Democrat appoint - Stephen Brever, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - dey work on at least one opposition, Politico report. If dem issue am as a majority ruling, Justice Alito opinion go overturn di constitutional right to abortion for US. And dis go allow individual states to ban di procedure or place more restriction ontop am. Di American Civil Liberties Union tok say if dem confirm am, di decision ""go deprive half of di nation a fundamental, constitutional right wey millions of women don enjoy for ova 50 years"". Di case involve one challenge to Mississippi ban on abortion afta 15 weeks, wey di justices hear for December. According to di BBC US partner CBS News, di leak go cause plenty damage to one of di institutions wey pipo respect well well for US. Chief Justice Roberts fit order full-blown investigation wey go involve di FBI to uncover di sources, CBS report. Dis kind leak no even happun for di year 2000 US presidency between George W Bush and AI Gore. Rove v Wade in 1973 give women for US absolute right to abort pregnancy wey dey three months and limited right in di second trimester. In 1992, inside Planned Parenthood v Casey, di court rule say state no fit place ""undue burden"" on women wey dey seek abortion before foetus fit survive outside di womb, at about 24 weeks. Na about 630,000 reported abortion dey for di US in 2019, according to di US Centres for Disease Control. Dis na about 18% decrease if you compare am with 2010. Women wey dey dia 20s account for di majority of abortions - in 2019 about 57% dey dis age group. Di highest of abortion na from Black Americans - 27 per 1,000 women aged 15-44."

Di price increase don disturb dia local supply. So di question now be say wia Africa wey dey import oil wela go turn to next for supply.

One tonne of palm oil be about $1,850 for di commodity exchange for Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. E den add, anoda 150 to 200 US dollars for transport and handling costs, per tonne.

Equiano Cable landing Lagos: Google undersea cable land Nigeria, wetin public go gain?	"Equiano cable wey tech giant Google plan to enable a five-fold increase in average internet speeds dey land Lagos Nigeria, so wetin public go gain? Nigeria na major landing point for di cable and di launch of dis digital access happun Thursday 21 April 2022. ""Dis Cable Landing [in Lagos] go provide approximately ""20 times more network capacity"" than di last cable dem build to serve di region."" Juliet Ehimuan, Director of Google for West Africa tok during one event to mark di launch. Better data connection and cheaper Internet, job creation and more go follow di launch, one Lagos goment official tok on Tuesday. Nigeria na Equiano second stop inside Africa, with future landings wey dey expected in Swakopmund, Namibia; and Melkbosstrand, South Africa. Equiano, wey name dey inspired by a Nigerian, go dey land at different points inside Africa, much like a road construction wey dey progress. Google Equiano na state of di art submarine Internet cable. Di tech search engine, Google, alongside one of dia major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC) na im dey arrange dis project. Di cable dey set to completely land on Friday, April 29, 2022. According to Google, di cable run from Portugal, through di West coast of Africa and all di way to South Africa. Di Internet cable, dey named after Olaudah Equiano, one historical abolitionist. And Equiano Cable get power of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes) wit higher levels of durability than di last cable dem build to serve di West African region. Tori be say for di landing site, wey dey Lagos island, dem plan to build massive new data centre. Google office wey tanda for Lagos dey serve all di kontries inside di West African sub-region. ""Through this network infrastructure, we project say by 2025 we go don create at least 1.6 million jobs."" Na wetin Google West Africa Director, Juliet Ehimuan tell di BBC. Di tech giant believe say dis infrastructure go boost Nigeria GDP by over $10billion dollars over a three-year period. Di subsea cable na West Indian Ocean Cable Company build am wit funding from Google to provide Open Access to internet service providers and businesses. If you dey wonder, submarine Internet cables na one of di primary reasons you fit easily read dis article. Na sake of dis technology you fit stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. So submarine cable launch and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria na like cause and effect. Nowadays, di average internet speed wey bin dey Nigeria na 18.7 Mbps, according to tech reviews - wey mean say internet data connection no too fast. For example, if you currently get a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, e go take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Back in di early 2000s, na very few pipo bin get phones and computers, and accessing di Internet dat time bin require buying time for cybercafe. Even wen mobile phones become available, you go likely waste time loading one page wit plenti pictures or trying to stream a video. As more business owners increase dia interest in Africa, technology begin to improve. 2009 record a major mile stone during di launch of di MainOne submarine cable, wey be one private submarine cable wey today spread between Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire. Afta dis launch, companies like Glo and MTN launch dia own submarine cables inside Nigeria. And na so internet access too begin increase, and more tech companies begin open shop for di kontri. Experts don tok say wit improved internet access, Africa fit catch up wit development across di continent. All things being equal, Google Internet cable fit drop di average download time to 1.2 minutes from 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Di tech giant don commit demsef to invest $1billion inside Africa in di next five years to improve access. If we believe Google claim, Equiano fit bring six times much faster Internet of 112 Mbps. Lagos be like di silicon valley of Nigeria, sake of say na di one state wey get high technology innovation. And di city wit over 22 million population na Nigeria commercial capital. Anoda major public gain fit dey for speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. Dis mean say you fit experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load. And, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts. Some Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data for di rate of 666. But all things being equal, dis fit drop to 140, according to wetin experts dey project from Equiano Cable landing. Google for July 2018 launch Google Station wey be dia fast speed internet station for Lagos, Nigeria. Wetin sweet pipo belle dat time na say e no go cost anytin to use dis internet, because na free! Na for Lagos Google announce dia partnership with Nigeria to bring free and fast internet to di masses. Nigeria no be di first kontri wia Google don do dis kain tin for - India, Mexico, Thailand and Indonesia don dey enjoy am already. Google Kontri Director for Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, say di plan na to make sure say more Nigerians participate for digital economy. Google say anyone wey wan use dia free internet no need to worri about mago-mago pipo wey wan tiff dia personal information because di way dem don do am, e no fit happun. Google Station wey don launch for Lagos go allow Nigerians to enjoy internet wey dey 'fast, reliable and no go drop', all dey need na to dey any of di six locations wey Google Stations wey dey di city."

A couple of years ago we borrow heavily to shore up wanna international reserves, but dis no be something govments go fit sustain. What central bank fit do he say dem go increase de short term interest rate to mop up liquidity from de market. Sake of de cedi dey depreciate, people dey convert dia monies into foreign currency. Sake of dis, more pressure dey on de dollars which dey make de cedi underperform even more. So if govment increase increase de short term interest rates, more people go now start dey release dia monies to de central bank.

Di report show say extreme weather conditions wey dey linked to climate change like floods and heatwaves dey affect humans and other species well-well pass before. Di new study don already dey pass di ability of many pipo to cope. While everyone dey affected, some pipo dey feel am pass. This outcome depend on where you live.

Continued and accelerating sea level rise go increasingly hit coastal settlements wey go push dem towards ""submergence and loss"". Under all emissions scenarios, di IPCC dey expect say one bllion more pipo go dey at risk from coastal specific climate hazards in di next few decades. If temperatures rise to between 1.7 and 1.8C above di 1850s level, half di human population go dey exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions wey go arise from heat and humidity. Diseases go likely spread more quickly in di coming decades, di pipo wey write di report tok.

Burkina Faso Coup: Military strongmen dey return to West Africa?	Afta di military takeover for Burkina Faso, regional analyst Paul Melly dey chook eye inside why West Africa don dey get new wave of coups recently. Less dan five months afta sojas enta national television for Guinea to announce say dem don comot President Alpha Cond from office, dem comot Roch Kabor for Burkina Faso on Monday. And dat na apart from di double coup for Mali wia army officers comot President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke ta for August 2020. Dem bin promise Ecowas say dem go run elections by next month, but for May 2021, di second coup happun and dem dey plan to stay for power for five more years. Yet for West Africa, almost all kontris be officially democratic konties, even di ones wey dia leaders go use kurukere means to stay for power. But with three members of Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States) under military rule, military regime don dey come back? But dat na di easy way to look at tins. Guinea reason for dia coup dey different. Dis na as dem don get long history of bad goment and repression. For 2010, Alpha Cond take ova power as di kontri first democratic head of state. Howeva, e start to dey act like dictator, even bend di law so e go fit run for third term in office for 2020 as e dey jail opposition. Wen e crash yakata for September afta sojas promise to return di kontri to democracy, almost all Guineans including im own political party hail di move. For Burkina Faso, like Mali, na di jihadist security kasala cause di coup. Di tori about Islamist attacks dey vex and fear pipo for streets and sojas dey vex as dem dey send dem to fight jihad without beta weapons, low pay and even dem no dey feed dem well. Dis week, Burkina Faso coup, like 2020 coup for Mali na sake of say lower and middle ranking sojas wey dey risk dia life for frontline para.

And for di past three years, e don be like insecurity just dey increase, especially for Burkina Faso as e dey affect communities wey connect di border to Niger so di border no safe, even as e dey near di capital of Ouagadougou. Dem elect Oga Kabor for 2015 afta dem chase comot authoritarian regime. Five years later, im win second term, for election pipo reason to der widely fair.
