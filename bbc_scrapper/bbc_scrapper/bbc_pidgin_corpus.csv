Nigeria's kidnapping crisis: Dem suppose ban ransom payments?	"As pesin wey don pay ransom three times to comot im family for kidnapper hand, Nigerian businessman Lawal Ado no too happy with moves to ban payment to kidnappers, One controversial bill to criminalise ransom payments na di latest attempt to reduce di kidnapping business wey dey boom for di kontri. Di proposal na to jail any pesin wey pay for up to 15 years. Oga Ado say im two daughters bin dey drive with police convoy for Buruku road, Kaduna state, wey dey notorious for criminal gang, wen dem kidnap dem for December. Dem dey kidnappers hand for 15 weeks until im pay 10m naira ($24,000, 19,000) in cash, na wetin e tell BBC. Few years later, dem kidnap im wife from im house for Kaduna city and na 700,000 naira make dem release am. Dem kidnap im mama when she dey go her village also for Kaduna state and na with 300,000 naira, di kidnappers take free am. Oga Ado tok say wen you see say men wey carry gun dey threaten di lives of your loved ones, you no get choice but to drop money. Lawmakers wan ban ransom only because ""dem neva get family member wey dem kidnap"", na wetin im add. But lawmakers dey argue say dat kai payments na im dey ginger di kidnap industry wia criminal gangs go just tiff pipo and ask for anytin from $50 to $1m. Since 2011, kidnappers don make at least $18m, with almost half of di money, na between 2016 and 2020 dem make am. Dis na wetin SBM Intelligence wey be think-tank for Lagos dey report. Detective superintendent Eguaoje Funmilayo from Federal Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) say families dey fear to involve police and go just pay ransom instead, wey be something wey police no dey ike make pipo do. For rare sucess, police announce say dem gbab two alleged oga wey organize di kidnap of some university students wey dia parents bin cough out 200m naira so dem go free dem, earlier dis month. Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi - wey propose di bill say kidnapping don turn, ""di most deadly kind of banditry for Nigeria, e don become di most common and uncontrollable crime for di kontri."" Di bill don pass upper chamber and go now enta lower house. No place dey safe from kidnap gangs but dem plenti pass for Northern Nigeria. Ova di years dem don target airports, railways, military barracks and religious places Families of pipo wey dem kidnap dey most times sell property, collect loan from bank and crowdfund so dem go fit raise ransom. Di victims wey no pay ransom sometines dey killed, tori dey sat dem dey comot dia human organs carry sell. Usman Mbaekwe, wey spend five days for forest for southern Nigeria afta dem attack di bus im dey inside say, security forces no even try at all to save am. Dem free am afta im wife raise 1m naira ( 2,000, $2,400). For tori wey be like dem tiff am from Nollywood feem, dem carry di pipo wey gt di cash for road wey lead from Lagos to Sapele, inside di Niger Delta, wey dem tell dem to drop di money for side of road, na wetin im tok. Kontris like US and UK no dey pay ransom to kidnappers, say di best way to stop kidnapping na to stop di ginger. But for kontris like France, Germany, Spain and Italy, tori be say dem don pay millions of dollars to free dia citizens wey African jaguda pipo hold or elsewhere. Tori be say even Nigerian federal goment don drop correct money give kidnappers before, like give Boko Haram so dem go free some of di Chibok girls dem kidnap for 2014, as Kastina sef drop money for di di release of schoolboys dem kidnap for 2020. More recently, na di attack for di Abuja-Kaduna train for March. At least eight pipo die and tori be say 60 pipo dey di gunmen hand. Di kidnappers no ask for ransom but dey ask oda tins from goment, wey dey boost tok say to stop ransom no go end kidnapping. Imran Rufai wey im broda dey train attacker hand say ""payment of ransom no be di problem, na kidnapping"" Zara Aliyu, wey also get train kidnapped broda, gree say, ""you only fit pass dat kain bill if beta security dey"".

Dis na as Nigeria voting centre stage don dey heat-up ahead of di 2023 general election. President Muhammadu Buhari don tell all im cabinet members wit ambition to contest elections to resign. Court of Appeal on Wednesday disagree wit one ruling by di federal high court for Umuahia wey cancel di controversial Section 84 (12) of di Electoral Act 2022. On 19 March, 2021 one Federal High Court rule say Section 84 (12) no follow law, ask di Attorney General of di Federation to remove am from di Nigerian Electoral Act 2022. Di court say di law dey illegal and na violation of di provisions of di 1999 Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). So why ""Section 84 12 of Nigerian Electoral Act"" dey controversial? Di Appeal Court judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike in her ruling uphold di Sections 66(1)(f); 107(1)(f); 137(1)(g); and 182(1)(g) of di 1999 Constitution wey say appointees of goment wey dey seek to contest elections go only resign at least 30 days to di date of di election, Di judge say any oda law wey mandate such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before dat day dey unconstitutional.

Airlines strike in Nigeria update: Ibom air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, odas go continue flight schedules as operators suspend action	"Di Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) don suspend dia plan to strike and stop flights schedule across di kontri. Di strike bin suppose start on Monday but di AON President Abdulmunaf Sarina tok inside statement wey six members of di association jointly sign say dem announce di suspension say dem do am in di interest of di national economy and security considerations. Di Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) bin don say di strike no go make sense and e go amount to exploitation if airlines suspend flights afta collecting money for tickets from passengers. Di operators dey complain of di increase in price of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel. Nigeria goment bin also beg di operators to ""reconsider dia stand"" sake of di effect. Di cost of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel don increase from N190 per litre to N700, dis na according to di airline operators of Nigeria. Abdulmunaf Sarina, president of di operators for letter wey e send to Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say di high cost of di fuel dey affect di operation cost of airlines. E say, ""while aviation fuel worldwide dey cost about 40% of airline operating cost globally, di present hike don increase Nigeria operating cost to about 95%."" Abdulmunaf Sarina say airlines dey run at a loss sake of di situation and e no good for dia business. ""Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wish to regrettably inform di general public say member airlines go discontinue operations nationwide wit effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice."" Nigeria Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say true-true aviation fuel don cost and e dey affect air transport. But di minister say make di operators look for anoda means to address di mata rather dan suspend flight activities. E say, im no fit do much because mata wey concern fuel no dey under im ministry. ""While efforts to manage di situation dey on, we wish to appeal to di airline operators, even in di difficult situation, to consider di multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking dia business-informed decisions and actions,"" e tok for statement by im special assistant on public affairs, Dr James Odaudu. Dis no be di first time operators bin plan to take dis kain action. Wen e happun e dey affect air travel. For March dis year, di operators bin complain about di same aviation fuel but dem no fit reach resolution wit goment and stakeholders for di oil industry. Earlier dis year, airline operators increase price or air fare by 50%. For instance, a trip of N23,000 before increase to N50,000. Di operators claim say di increase for di price of tickets na sake of di high cost of aviation fuel. Air travellers complain wella during dat period but pipo still continue to travel by air. Wit di latest plan to bin suspend dia business, e no clear weda dem wan increase di price of dia ticket again. Di six airline operators wey bin sign di statement to suspend strike include Abdulmunaf - Managing Director of Azman Air; Shehu Wada - Executive Director of Max Air; and Obiora Okonkwo - Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines. Odas be Roy Ilegbodu - Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air; Abdullahi Mahmood - Chief Executive Officer of Aero Contractors; and Allen Onyema - Chairman of Air Peace. Earlier, di Ministry of Aviation bin assured Nigerians say members of AON bin dey review dia decision to withdraw services on Monday, May 9. Dem bin confam say Ibom Air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, and odas go carry on with dia normal flight schedules. Incidents of insecurity don make some Nigerians avoid travelling by road. Di recent Kaduna-Abuja train attack by terrorists also neva comot from pipo mind. If airlines suspend dia operations as planned, Nigerians go begin look for oda means of traveling. Though Ibom airline don announce say dem no go join di suspension - only dem no go fit cater for all di thousands of travellers wey dey make dia trip by air. But di remaining alternative go come be di use of private jets or airplane charter. E get several private jet charter companies for Nigeria wey dey offer those services. Di service dey expensive. Findings show say, a 40 minute to one hour trip within di kontri, cost up to N2 million ($5,500). Some pipo fit also do join hire of a private jet wey fit carry specific number of pipo. Dem go share di bill among dem sef. E neva clear weda di airline suspension go take effect from Monday but pipo don begin reason oda alternatives."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-61369130

Sani say anytime e hear about di statistics for Radio or Television e dey remind am of im daughter and how she for don grow by now. Unlike before wey I no dey mind, now anytime I hear malaria stats for radio or TV e dey remind me of Halima and how she for don grow by now, Sani tok. She don already learn to siddon and me and her dey play wella anytime I dey house. Deaths from Malaria especially for pikin dem na im don make WHO approve one vaccine for children to treat Malaria. During di trials of di vaccine for Malawi, Ghana and Kenya dem find out say di vaccine reduce malaria cases by forty per cent. Di mother Zahrau Mustapha say she dey think of Halima every blessed day even though God don bless her with another Daughter, Safiya, wey recently clock nine months. Halima na my first child and I born her on 20th September 2019 and she die on 4th March 2020. No single day wey I no dey think of her. She add say di death of Halima don make dem dey take extra care in terms of protecting themselves from Malaria. After her death we buy extra mosquito nets and we dey quick enter and for our baby na double net for her because inside our net she get her own inside and also insecticide dey always dey now. Zahrau call on goments to bring back the mosquito spray wey dey happun before many areas before now.

Sani say for Gurin Gawa area wey dem dey for Kano no be only dem lose pikin from Malaria as some of im neighbours also suffer di same fate. For most cases, malaria dey transfer through di bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes - na more than 400 different species of Anopheles mosquito dey, of which around 30 dey carri malaria. Di mosquitoes wey dey spread di disease dey bite usually wen pipo dey sleep for night. As 25 April na World Malaria Day, dis na wetin you suppose sabi about di disease: Malaria signs - high fever, headache, and cold - go usually appear 10-15 days afta mosquito wey get infection bite. E fit dey small and hard to recognise say na malaria, but if dem no treat am within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria fit lead to serious sickness, wey fit lead to death. Dr Usman Qalbusunnah na medical doctor for Rigasa General hospital for Kaduna state (northwest Nigeria) and e say despite plenty efforts malaria still dey on di increase across di kontri. On a daily basis 60% of patients wey I dey attend to na malaria cases wey show say di illness still dey go up despite all efforts to end it. Anoda thing be say na di resistant form of malaria dey now wia be say treatment dey take longer in fact some patients go return to hospital after a week or two wit di same malaria symptoms. Dr Usman say prevention and not treatment na di way to go so far as Malaria dey concern because no matter di improvement in treatments if cases continue dey happun e no go augur well for society. Na goment get biggest role to play for dis issue, first provide good drainages for areas and also refuse dumps suppose dey far away from pipo. As for individuals pipo suppose make sure say dia homes dey clean and free from dirty, stagnant water and dirty wey dey attract mosquitoes and make pipo dey sleep inside treated mosquito nets.

Equiano Cable landing Lagos: Google undersea cable land Nigeria, wetin public go gain?	"Equiano cable wey tech giant Google plan to enable a five-fold increase in average internet speeds dey land Lagos Nigeria, so wetin public go gain? Nigeria na major landing point for di cable and di launch of dis digital access happun Thursday 21 April 2022. ""Dis Cable Landing [in Lagos] go provide approximately ""20 times more network capacity"" than di last cable dem build to serve di region."" Juliet Ehimuan, Director of Google for West Africa tok during one event to mark di launch. Better data connection and cheaper Internet, job creation and more go follow di launch, one Lagos goment official tok on Tuesday. Nigeria na Equiano second stop inside Africa, with future landings wey dey expected in Swakopmund, Namibia; and Melkbosstrand, South Africa. Equiano, wey name dey inspired by a Nigerian, go dey land at different points inside Africa, much like a road construction wey dey progress. Google Equiano na state of di art submarine Internet cable. Di tech search engine, Google, alongside one of dia major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC) na im dey arrange dis project. Di cable dey set to completely land on Friday, April 29, 2022. According to Google, di cable run from Portugal, through di West coast of Africa and all di way to South Africa. Di Internet cable, dey named after Olaudah Equiano, one historical abolitionist. And Equiano Cable get power of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes) wit higher levels of durability than di last cable dem build to serve di West African region. Tori be say for di landing site, wey dey Lagos island, dem plan to build massive new data centre. Google office wey tanda for Lagos dey serve all di kontries inside di West African sub-region. ""Through this network infrastructure, we project say by 2025 we go don create at least 1.6 million jobs."" Na wetin Google West Africa Director, Juliet Ehimuan tell di BBC. Di tech giant believe say dis infrastructure go boost Nigeria GDP by over $10billion dollars over a three-year period. Di subsea cable na West Indian Ocean Cable Company build am wit funding from Google to provide Open Access to internet service providers and businesses. If you dey wonder, submarine Internet cables na one of di primary reasons you fit easily read dis article. Na sake of dis technology you fit stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. So submarine cable launch and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria na like cause and effect. Nowadays, di average internet speed wey bin dey Nigeria na 18.7 Mbps, according to tech reviews - wey mean say internet data connection no too fast. For example, if you currently get a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, e go take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Back in di early 2000s, na very few pipo bin get phones and computers, and accessing di Internet dat time bin require buying time for cybercafe. Even wen mobile phones become available, you go likely waste time loading one page wit plenti pictures or trying to stream a video. As more business owners increase dia interest in Africa, technology begin to improve. 2009 record a major mile stone during di launch of di MainOne submarine cable, wey be one private submarine cable wey today spread between Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire. Afta dis launch, companies like Glo and MTN launch dia own submarine cables inside Nigeria. And na so internet access too begin increase, and more tech companies begin open shop for di kontri. Experts don tok say wit improved internet access, Africa fit catch up wit development across di continent. All things being equal, Google Internet cable fit drop di average download time to 1.2 minutes from 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Di tech giant don commit demsef to invest $1billion inside Africa in di next five years to improve access. If we believe Google claim, Equiano fit bring six times much faster Internet of 112 Mbps. Lagos be like di silicon valley of Nigeria, sake of say na di one state wey get high technology innovation. And di city wit over 22 million population na Nigeria commercial capital. Anoda major public gain fit dey for speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. Dis mean say you fit experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load. And, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts. Some Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data for di rate of 666. But all things being equal, dis fit drop to 140, according to wetin experts dey project from Equiano Cable landing. Google for July 2018 launch Google Station wey be dia fast speed internet station for Lagos, Nigeria. Wetin sweet pipo belle dat time na say e no go cost anytin to use dis internet, because na free! Na for Lagos Google announce dia partnership with Nigeria to bring free and fast internet to di masses. Nigeria no be di first kontri wia Google don do dis kain tin for - India, Mexico, Thailand and Indonesia don dey enjoy am already. Google Kontri Director for Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, say di plan na to make sure say more Nigerians participate for digital economy. Google say anyone wey wan use dia free internet no need to worri about mago-mago pipo wey wan tiff dia personal information because di way dem don do am, e no fit happun. Google Station wey don launch for Lagos go allow Nigerians to enjoy internet wey dey 'fast, reliable and no go drop', all dey need na to dey any of di six locations wey Google Stations wey dey di city."
