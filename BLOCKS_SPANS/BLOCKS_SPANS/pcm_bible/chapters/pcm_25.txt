Jerusalem, where many pipol dey stay before, don empty naw. Di town wey great pass oda nashons before, don bi like woman wey en husband die leave. Na Jerusalem bi kween for di world before, but naw, na slave e bi.
Jerusalem pipol dey kry well-well for nite. Doz wey love am nor dey again to konfort am and all en friends don lie for en head; dem don turn en enemy.
Dem karry Judah pipol go Babilon as slave kon dey sofa dem. Na anoda land dem dey stay and dem nor get peace at-all. Even with di pain wey dem dey pass thru, evribody wey porshu dem, katch and ponish dem.
Jerusalem road dey mourn, bikos nobody dey pass der go celebrate again. Di town gate kwayet and pain won kill di priests dem. Di yong wimen dey kry, bikos di trobol wey dem dey face, too mush!
Jerusalem enemies don turn dia oga naw and dem dey prosper, bikos God ponish Jerusalem pipol for di sins wey dem kommit. Dem don katch and take dia shidren go far land.
All di glory wey Jerusalem get, don vanish. En prince bi like deer wey dey find grass to chop, bikos e dey hongry. Dem too dey weak to run from dia enemies wey dey porshu dem.
Even inside en pain, Jerusalem remember wen e nor get money or house to stay. E still remember all di propaty wey e bin get. But naw, en enemies don attack am and nobody gri kom help am. Di way e take fall, dey make en enemies laf.
Bikos Jerusalem sin well-well, God kon rijet dem like dirty rag. All di pipol wey dey honor am before, don hate am naw, bikos dem don si en nakednes and shame. Di only tin wey e fit do naw, na to dey kry with pain and hide en face with shame.
E nor keep ensef klean or tink of wetin go happen to am. Naw, e dey inside gutta and nobody won bring am out. So e kry kon sey, “Oga God, make Yu si wetin dey happen to mi; my enemies don win mi.”
Dem don tif all wetin e get; all en betta tins don vanish. E dey look as strenjas dey use di holy temple anyhow; di place wey God sey make dem nor enter.
En pipol dey feel di pain and dem dey find wetin dem go chop. E sell en betta-betta tins make e for si money take buy food chop, so dat e nor go die. So e kry, “My God, make Yu look kon si as I dey sofa.”
Una wey dey waka pass, my sofa nor mean anytin to una? Make una look round, una si anybody wey dey sofa like mi? But na God vexnashon dey kause dis pain and sofa for mi.
E send fire kom from heaven and e dey burn inside my bone. E set trap for mi and I fall enter. Naw E don forget mi and I dey sofa well-well.
E know all my sins; so E put dem togeda kon hang and tie dem round my neck. I weak well-well, bikos my sins too heavy. God don make my enemies strong pass mi and I nor fit do dem anytin.
God don turn all my strong sojas to fool. As E kommand, many sojas kom distroy my sojas. God mash and press my pipol, just as dem dey press grape.
Bikos of dis tins; I kry well-well, but nobody dey to konfort or give mi hope. My shidren nor get future, bikos awa enemies don win us.
Jerusalem dey beg for help, but nobody gri help am. God don tok against Jakob sey, “Doz nashons wey dey around yu, go bi yor enemies! Dem go ponish and trowey Jerusalem like dirty rag!”
Jerusalem sey, “God dey rite, bikos I go against en kommand. So pipol for evriwhere, make una listin kon si as I dey sofa! Dem don karry my shidren go Babilon as slave.
I koll all di pipol wey love mi make dem help mi, but instead, dem kom deceive mi. Na honga kill my priests and leaders for di town wen dem dey find food wey dem go chop.
So my God, make Yu si as I dey sofa! My heart dey kry, bikos of my sins. Dem dey kill pipol for di street and even deat dey inside house too dey wait mi.
Even doh dem hear sey I dey sofa, nobody gri kom konfort mi. My enemies know sey I dey trobol and dem dey happy to si as God ponish mi. Make di Judgement Day wey Yu promise kom, so dat dem go sofa, just as I don sofa so.
My God, make yu si all di wiked tins wey dem dey do. Make Yu ponish dem, just as Yu ponish mi for all my sins. My pains many and e dey make mi sick well-well.”God disgrace Zion bikos E dey vex. E don trowey Israel pride from heaven kom down and E nor protet di temple again bikos E really dey vex with dem.
God nor sorry for Jakob shidren-shidren, instead E distroy dia house. Wen E dey vex, E break Jerusalem strong fine wall kon disgrace di kingdom with doz wey dey rule am.
E vex distroy Israel pipol pawa; E nor gri help Israel wen dia enemies kom attack dem. Just as fire dey distroy tins, na so too E distroy Israel land.
E set arrow kon shot us like sey wi bi en enemies. Yes, en rite hand dey ready to shot. E kill us with awa strong men kon pour en vexnashon like fire for Zion head.
God distroy Israel like sey E bi awa enemy. E distroy all di palis dem kon skata awa betta towns. E make evribody for Judah kry and mourn.
E distroy en temple like sey na vineyard kon skata where wi for dey woship am. God make Zion pipol forget dia festival and Sabat Day. Naw, kings and priests don fall, bikos E dey vex.
God rijet en own altar kon hate en temple. E allow enemies distroy di walls and dem kon dey shaut inside di temple like sey dem dey do party.
God won distroy Jerusalem fine wall. E dey plan to distroy am and E go do wetin E plan. Den E go skata di towas and di walls rish groun.
Di town gates don sink enter groun. E skata all di keys and bars wey dem take dey lock di gates. Dem take en prince dem and kings go Babilon as slave. Law nor dey again and God profets nor dey get any vishon from am again.
Jerusalem leaders sidan kwayet for groun. Dem wear sak klot kon pak dust put for dia head and di yong wimen kover dia face for groun with shame.
I don kry sotey wota nor gri kom out from my eye again; my heart don break. I don taya and e dey pain bi wen I si how dem distroy my pipol and how shidren dey faint anyhow for di town.
Dem dey kry give dia mama sey, “Wi wont chop and drink!” Dem dey faint for di town like sojas wey wound for war and dem dey die small-small for dia mama hand.
Wetin I go fit tok? Who don ever si dis kind sofa before? Wetin I go fit take kompare yu, Jerusalem? How I go fit take konfort yu? Bikos di wound wey yu wound, deep like sea. Na who go fit heal yu?
Yor profets dey lie for yu kon sey dem si vishon. Na dem make una go Babilon, bikos dem nor tell una about una sins. Instead, dem make una tink sey una nor nid to turn from una sin kom meet God.
Pipol wey dey pass di town dey look una with shame. Dem dey laf and shake dia heads, bikos Jerusalem don skata. Dem sey, “Nor bi di fine town wey di world bin like well-well bi dis?”
All yor enemies dey laf and happy sey, “At last, wi don distroy am! Wi don dey wait for dis day since and naw, e don kom.”
But na God do wetin E plan. E don do wetin E promise and E warn us about am since. E nor sorry for Jerusalem kon distroy am. E give awa enemies viktory and dem dey happy, bikos God don distroy us.
Jerusalem wall wey fine well-well, make yu kry give God! Both day and nite, make di wota from yor eye dey flow like river! Make yu nor rest or stop to kry!
Wake-up for nite, make yu kry. Pour all yor heart like wota before God! Raiz yor hand as yu dey pray to am and dey beg for yor shidren wey dey faint, bikos honga won kill dem.
Si, Oga God! Why Yu dey ponish us like dis? Make wimen chop dia shidren wey dem love? Or make dem kill priests and profets for inside God temple, bikos of sofa?
Si yong and old pipol don die for di street. Enemies don kill both boys and girls. Yu don kill dem, bikos Yu dey vex and Yu nor sorry for dem wen Yu dey kut dem.
Just as dem dey invite pesin for party, na so too Yu invite my enemies and I kon dey fear. For di day wey God dey vex, nobody go fit eskape or survive am. Naw, my enemies don kill all di shidren wey I born and train.I bi one pesin wey know wetin e mean wen God ponish yu.
E don porshu mi and naw I dey waka for darkness.
Evritime, na only mi E dey always ponish.
E don make my skin and flesh old kon break di bones for my body.
Na sofa and wahala E pak full my life.
Even doh I neva die, E beri mi for darkness like pesin wey don die.
E don tie mi with shain like prisona wey nor get hope to eskape.
I kry well-well make E help mi, but God nor gri ansa mi.
E use big-big stones take block evriwhere wey I dey pass and I nor know di rite road again.
To mi, E hide like bear or lion wey dey wait to attack pesin.
E drag mi komot for road; tear mi to pieces kon leave mi and nobody dey to help mi.
E set en arrow to take shot mi die
and naw, E don shot mi and di arrow enter my heart.
I don turn pesin wey pipol dey laf and sing yeye song for.
Na bitterness and sofa bi di food and drink wey God dey give mi.
E don use my face rub groun kon break my tit with stone.
I nor know wetin peace mean again and I don forget as happiness dey bi.
Den I kry kon sey, “I nor get respet again! I don lost evritin wey I hope to get from God!”
Wen ever I remember as I take sofa without house to sleep, e dey pain mi like poizin for my belle.
I nor go ever forget di time wen I take sofa; wen I bin dey mourn, bikos of evritin wey I lost.
Anytime I remember all dis tins, I know sey I still get hope.
God faithful love nor dey end! And en mesi nor dey finish.
Wi dey always trust Yu bikos na evriday Yu dey show us yor goodness.
I tell mysef sey, “Na only God I get, so I go trust only en.”
God dey good to pipol wey trust and dey find am.
So e betta make wi sidan kwayet kon wait until God go kom save us.
And na naw wey wi still dey yong, wi suppose learn how to get patient as wi dey wait for God.
Make wi sidan kwayet wen God dey deal with us.
Make wi bow face groun, may bi na den God go give us hope again.
Pesin wey dem slap for one side, make e turn di oda side. Make e nor tok wen en enemies dey curse am.
Bikos God nor go forget us forever.
Even doh sey E dey make us sofa naw, E still dey sorry for us, bikos en great love for us nor dey end.
God nor like to sofa pipol or make dem kry.
So to dey opress pipol for dis world,
to shit pipol kon kollect wetin bi dia own, God wey dey heaven dey si evritin
and E know dey happy wen dem nor give pesin korrect judgement for kourt.
So, na who fit tok make sometin happen, if God nor allow am?
Nor bi from God mout evritin from kom? Both good and bad?
Den, why wi human being go dey komplain if dem ponish us for awa sins?
Instead, make wi shek and test di tins wey wi dey do kon turn from sin kom meet God.
Make wi lift awa hand and heart to God for heaven kon sey,
“Wi don sin and go against Yu and na dis make Yu dey vex for us.
Yu don hide yorsef bikos Yu dey vex and Yu porshu us komot for yor front. Yu nor even pity for us wen Yu dey kill us.
Yu hide yorsef for di kloud, so dat awa prayers nor go rish where Yu dey.
Yu don make us bi like dirty rag for all di oda nashons front.
All awa enemies dey tok bad against us.
Wi dey fear, bikos wi dey trap; wi don konfuse and distroy awasef.
Wota dey rush kom out from my eye, bikos dem don distroy my pipol finish.
I still dey kry well-well and I nor go stop at-all
until God go look from heaven kon si wetin don happen.
My heart heavy well-well wen I si wetin happen to di wimen for dis town.
Pipol wey I nor do bad to, set trap for mi like sey I bi bird.
Dem trow mi inside one pit kon dey drop stone for my head.
Dem dey pour wota put for my head and I tink sey na die I dey.
But from inside di deep pit, I kon koll Yu wey bi my Oga God.
Yu hear my kry for help wen I sey: ‘God make Yu listin to mi well-well!’
Yes! Wen I koll Yu, Yu kom tell mi sey, ‘Nor fear.’
Oga God, na Yu bi my lawyer, so make Yu judge my kase, bikos Yu don save my life.
Yu don si di bad-bad tins wey dem do mi. So my God, make Yu judge my kase, so dat pipol go know sey I dey rite.
Yu don si all dia plans to revensh mi.
Yu don hear all di wiked names wey dem dey koll mi and Yu know all di plans wey dem don make.
Evriday, my enemies dey tok as dem dey plan against mi.
Si dem! Weda dem sidan or stand, na mi dem dey laf and take dey sing.
So Oga God, make Yu pay dem back for all di bad tins wey dem don do.
Make Yu give dem sturbon and strong heart, so dat yor curse go dey dia head.
So as Yu dey vex, make Yu porshu and distroy dem komot dis world.”Make una si as gold nor dey yuzful again. Di gold wey fine and dey shine well-well before, nor dey shine again and di temple stones don skata for di street.
Just as gold dey important and get value, na so too Jerusalem shidren dey important before, but naw, pipol dey trit dem like ordinary pot wey dem make with klay.
Even as jackals wiked rish, dem still dey give dia shidren breast make dem suck, but my pipol wiked like ostrich for desert.
Dia shidren tongue don gum, bikos dem nor si wota drink; dem dey beg waka, but nobody gri give dem food chop.
Pipol wey dey chop betta food before, don turn who dey beg food for street. Pipol wey dey wear fine and betta klot before, don turn who dey wear rag naw.
Di ponishment wey I give my pipol worse pass Sodom pipol own, bikos na wons e take happen and nobody dey to help dem.
Before-before, dia prince dem shine pass snow and white pass milk. Dia body smooth pass rubi stone and wen yu si dem, dem dey shine pass safaya stone.
But naw, dia face don black pass black powder and wen dem dey waka for street, pipol nor even know dem again. Dia body don tin finish and dem dry like dry wood.
Pipol wey die for war, betta pass doz wey hongry kill, bikos na food wey dem nor si chop, kill dem.
Wen dem distroy my pipol, even wimen wey love dia shidren, dey kook dem chop, bikos of honga.
But naw, God don pour en vexnashon finish. E don send fire kon burn Jerusalem town rish groun.
Before, pipol and kings for oda nashons nor ever tink sey enemies go fit attack Jerusalem, tok-less of to skata am.
But dis tin happen, bikos of di sin wey di profets and di priests kommit and bikos of di innocent pipol for di town, wey dem kill.
Dem dey waka anyhow for di street like sey dem nor dey si; dis na bikos dem don stain diasef with blood and naw, pipol nor fit tosh dem again.
Naw, pipol dey shaut for dem anyhow sey, “Komot for here! Una wey dey smell! Make una nor tosh us!” So dem kon komot der go anoda town, but any town wey dem waka go, di pipol dey porshu dem.
Na God skata dem and E nor dey help dem again. Pipol nor dey respet dia priests or honor di leaders again.
Naw, awa eyes dey pain us well-well, bikos wi dey wait for pipol to kom help us. But wi just dey wait for nor-tin, bikos dem nor go fit help us.
Awa enemies dey wosh awa movement and naw, wi nor fit waka for di street again. Awa days for dis world don almost finish, bikos wi go soon die.
Doz wey dey porshu us, fast pass eagle wey dey fly for sky. Dem porshu us pass di mountin kon set trap for us for wildaness.
Dem katch di pesin wey make us dey alive, di king wey God choose and wi bin get hope sey e go protet us from awa enemies.
Edom pipol wey dey stay for Uz land, make una dey laf naw. Make una know sey dis judgement cup go rish where una dey too; una go drink from am until di drink don shark una and una go kon naked.
Jerusalem pipol, God nor go ponish una again, instead E go take una komot from Babilon go back to una own land. But una wey kom from Edom, make una nor worry, God go ponish una, bikos of una sins.Awa God, make Yu tink about dis tins wey dey happen to us naw and how awa enemies don disgrace us rish.
Strenjas don take all wetin wi get and na dem dey stay for awa town naw.
Wi don turn shidren wey nor get papa and awa mama don turn who en husband don die.
Wi must pay money to drink awa own wota and buy awa own firewood too.
Dem really dey porshu us and naw, wi don taya, but wi nor fit rest at-all.
Wi don make agriment with Egypt and Assyria pipol, so dat wi go get enough food to chop make honga nor for kill us.
Na awa grand-grand papa dem sin and dem don die, but naw, wi dey sofa dia ponishment.
Doz wey bi awa slave before, don turn awa oga naw and nobody dey to save us from dia pawa.
Wi dey risk awa life as wi dey find food wey wi go chop, bikos tif many for di towns and di village dem.
Awa skin hot like oven and na honga make us dey sick so.
Enemies don rape awa wifes for Jerusalem and dem don disgrace awa yong girls for Judah town.
Dem hang and kill di kings family kon trit awa eldas anyhow.
Dem karry awa yong men go do strong work and awa boys dey stagga, bikos of di heavy wood wey dem dey karry.
Awa eldas nor fit sidan for di town gate again and di yong men nor dey dance and sing again.
Joy nor dey awa heart again bikos wi wey bin sabi dance, don turn who dey mourn naw.
Awa crown don fall komot from awa head, bikos wi don sin and naw, wi dey sofa.
Bikos of dis, wi dey feel pain and wi nor dey si well again; awa eyes don dey weak, bikos wi don kry taya.
Mount Zion don empty and nobody dey der again, so naw, na wild animals dey stay der.
So Yu my Oga God, go rule forever and ever! Yor throne go dey from one generashon go rish anoda one.
But why Yu forget us like dis and wetin make Yu leave us since?
My Oga God, make Yu save and take us back as yor own! Make Yu give us di happiness wey wi get before.
Abi Yu don rijet us forever? Yu go kontinue to dey vex for us?
