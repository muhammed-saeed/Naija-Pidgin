Na King David pikin, Solomon, wey dey rule Jerusalem, rite dis words.
Di tisha sey, “Evritin dey yuzles! Yes, evritin really dey yuzles!”
Wetin pipol dey gain from all di hard work wey dem dey do for dis world?
Wen one generashon kom, di one wey dey before go-go, but di world nor dey shange.
Di sun dey raiz-up and down, den e go hurry go anoda place where e go for raiz again.
Breeze dey blow go sout and nort. Yes! E dey blow round like circol.
Even as wota dey flow enter sea rish, di sea nor dey ever full, bikos, na from where di wota from kom, na der dem go rush go again.
All dis tins dey taya pesin and nobody fit shange or tok as dem bi: No matter wetin wi dey si and hear, awa eyes still won si and awa ear still won hear more.
Wetin don happen before, go happen again and wetin pipol don do before, dem go do am again, bikos nor-tin dey new for dis world.
E get anytin for dis world wey fit make pesin sey, “Kom si o-o! Dis one neva happen before o-o”? But di trut bi sey, e don happen even before dem born us.
Wi nor dey remember wetin don happen before and for di next generashon, nobody go remember wetin wi dey do naw.
Mi wey dey tish una, I bi king for Israel and I stay for Jerusalem
and I make up my mind to search and undastand evritin wey pipol don do for dis world. But I kon si sey, God don really give us betta work to do for dis world.
As I tink about evritin wey human being dey do for dis world, I kon sey: Evritin dey yuzles; e just bi like sey pesin dey porshu breeze.
Wetin bend, wi nor go fit strait am and wetin nor dey, wi nor go fit provide am.
Den I tell mysef, “Na mi wise pass evry oda king wey don rule for Jerusalem before mi. Bikos I get wisdom and undastandin wey dem nor get.”
So I kon gri to find out wetin wisdom, madness and foolishness bi. But e klear sey, na breeze I just dey porshu,
bikos di more I dey find out, di more e dey worry mi well-well, bikos plenty wisdom dey bring plenty wahala too. So di more yu know, di more yu dey kause wahala for yorsef.I tell mysef, “Make yu go enjoy yorsef, so dat yu go know wetin happiness bi” But I kon si sey, dat one too, dey yuzles.
I still si sey, “E dey foolish to dey laf anyhow and to dey find enjoyment waka, nor dey make pesin get any betta tin!”
I really tink well-well about wetin wine go fit do for mi. I bilive sey na wisdom I dey use and I nor go bihave like fool, so dat I go know wetin dey good for pipol to do for dis world, as dem dey live dia life wey go soon end.
I make wetin I get plenty; build big-big house for mysef kon plant vineyards for evriwhere.
I design fine gardin and parks for mysef kon plant difren-difren fruits for der.
I dig where wota go for dey flow for di gardin, so dat di tree dem go grow well.
I hire both men and wimen savant and I still get savants wey dem born for my house. My animal and di pipol wey dey kare for dem, many pass any of di kings own wey don rule for Jerusalem before naw.
Silva, golds and oda good tins wey I karry from oda kings and nashons, I still save dem for mysef. I hire good singas, both men and wimen and I get many fine-fine girl-friends. Yes! I get evritin wey suppose make man happy!
So I get money and propaty pass all di kings wey don rule Jerusalem before mi, plus all dis tins, I still get betta wisdom.
I dey get anytin wey I wont and I nor stop mysef from anytin wey go make mi happy. I dey proud for evritin wey I don work for and na all dis, bi my reward.
But as I sidan dey tink of evritin wey I don do, I si sey all of dem dey yuzles. Dem bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze! E nor really get anytin wey pesin fit gain for dis world.
So I kon sey, make I try know di difrence between wisdom and foolishness. Abi e get anytin wey who take-ova from mi won do, wey I nor do before.
I don si sey, just as lite betta pass darkness, na so too, to know sometin, betta pass foolishness.
Wise pipol dey si where dem dey go, but foolish pipol dey waka fall for darkness. But I still si sey, both wise and foolish pipol dey sofa di same tins.
So I tell mysef, “Na wetin go happen to fools, go still happen to mi! Both of us go still die! So wetin I kon gain with all dis wisdom wey I get?” So I kry kon tell mysef, “E nor get any good tin wey wisdom dey give!”
Bikos both wise and foolish man, go die and time dey kom wen dem nor go remember di wise pesin just as dem nor go remember di foolish pesin again! So one day, pipol go forget di two of dem.
So, I hate dis life, bikos evritin wey dey inside, dey give trobol. Evritin dey yuzles and e bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze.
I hate all di hard work wey I don do for dis world, bikos evritin wey I don sofa for, I go die leave dem for anoda pesin to enjoy.
And who go fit know weda di one wey go kom afta mi go dey wise or foolish? But dem go kontrol evritin wey I work for, for dis world! So, make una si as evritin dey yuzles!
So I kon regret sey, I too work hard for dis world.
Some pipol work with wisdom; with wetin dem know and with dia skill; but dem go still die leave evritin for anoda pesin wey nor work at-all. Dis tins dey yuzles and nor dey good at-all.
So wetin pipol go gain for dis life afta all dia hard work and trobol?
As far as yu dey alive, evritin wey yu dey do, nor dey bring anytin escept pain and trobol and yu nor go even fit rest well for nite. All dis tins dey yuzles!
So I kon sey, nor-tin dey good dan for pesin to chop, drink and enjoy di work wey e dey do, bikos all dis enjoyment kom from God.
Bikos nobody go fit chop, drink and enjoy anytin, escept na God gi-am.
God dey give wisdom, knowledge and joy to pipol wey dey do wetin E wont. But if pesin wey dey sin get money and propaty well-well, God go take dem from am kon gi-am to pesin wey dey do wetin E wont. All dis tins dey yuzles too and dem bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze.Evritin wey dey happen for dis world, dey happen for di rite time wey God wont make e happen.
Time dey to born and time dey to die; time dey to plant sometin and time dey to harvest wetin yu plant.
Time dey to kill and time dey to heal pesin; time dey to skata and time dey to build.
Time dey to kry and time dey to laf; time dey to mourn and time dey to dance.
Time dey to skata stones and time dey to gada dem again; time dey to embrace pesin and time dey not to embrace pesin.
Time dey to find sometin and time dey to stop to find; time dey to keep sometin and time dey to trowey tins.
Time dey to tear klot and time dey to sew; time dey to just dey kwayet and time dey to tok.
Time dey to love pesin and time dey to hate pesin too; time dey to fight war and time dey to make peace.
So, wetin pipol really dey gain for all di hard work wey dem do?
I don si di heavy work wey God give us en pipol, so dat wi go dey busy.
God dey make evritin happen for di rite time. Yet nobody go fit really undastand all di tins wey E don do and E put kweshons for awa mind about wetin don happen before and wetin go still happen.
So I gri sey, e nor get anytin wey betta rish to dey happy and enjoy yorsef as far as yu dey alive.
So, make pipol chop, drink and enjoy wetin dem work for, bikos all dis tins na God gift.
Bikos I know sey anytin wey God do, na final and e go dey forever; dem nor go fit add anytin join am or remove anytin from inside. God make evritin like dis, so dat pipol go fear am.
Wetin dey happen naw, don happen before and wetin go happen for future don still happen before, bikos God dey make di same tin happen again and again.
I still si sey, for dis world, yu go si wikedness for where good judgement and rite pipol suppose dey.
Den I tell mysef, “E nor go tey before God go judge evribody, bikos of evritin wey dem don do! Both good and bad pipol.”
I still sey, “God dey do all dis tins bikos of us, so dat wi go know sey wi nor betta pass animals.”
Na di same tin go happen to pipol and animal; di two of dem must die. So pipol nor betta pass animal. Dis tin dey yuzles too.
Di two of dem dey waka go di same place and bikos God kreate dem with san, wen dem die, dem go turn to san again.
Who go fit show sey, wen pesin die, en spirit dey go up, but wen animal die, na groun en spirit dey go?
So I si sey, di best tin to do as human being, na to enjoy wetin wi don work for. Dat na di rizin why wi dey here, bikos nobody go fit bring us kom enjoy life again afta wi don die.Den I tink of all di wiked tins wey dey happen for dis world. I si pipol wey dem dey opress, dey kry and nobody dey to help dem. Nobody dey to save dem from doz pawaful men wey dey opress dem.
So I sey, e betta well-well for pipol wey don die, pass doz wey still dey alive.
But di ones wey dia own betta pass, na shidren wey dem neva born, bikos dem neva si all di wiked tins wey dey happen for dis world.
Den I tink of all di work wey pipol dey do and I kon si sey, evritin wey dem dey do, na to know who betta pass. But all dis tins dey yuzles too, e just bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze.
Foolish pesin dey fold en hand and nor dey work, so e nor get anytin to chop, escept en own flesh.
E betta make yu get small propaty with peace for mind, dan to dey work hard, bikos yu nor go still gain anytin and e bi like wen pesin dey try to katch breeze.
I still notis anoda tin for life wey dey yuzles.
E get one man wey dey stay alone, e nor get pikin or broda, but e dey work hard to get more propaty. But e ask ensef, “Na who I dey work for sef wey make mi nor dey fit enjoy mysef?” All dis tins dey yuzles well-well o-o!
Two pipol betta pass one pesin, bikos dem get betta reward for dia work.
Bikos if one pesin fall, di oda pesin go help am stand. But pesin wey dey alone, e go bad well-well for am wen e fall.
Na so too, wen two pipol sleep togeda, dem go fit make each oda body warm, but na how one pesin fit take make ensef warm?
Dem fit attack and win one pesin wey stand alone, but two pipol go stand fight kon win. Na three pesin even betta pass, bikos e dey hard to kut three rope wey dem tie togeda.
E betta make yu dey poor and wise as youth, dan to bi old foolish king wey nor dey take advise.
Even if dem born dat youth for poor house or if e dey prison since, e fit kom out kon bi king for en town.
I don si for dis world as evribody dey follow one yong man wey dey lead dem afta di king die.
Even doh many pipol dey support am naw, anoda generashon go grow kon rijet am leta. So yu si, evritin dey yuzles and e just bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze.Make yu dey kareful wen yu enter God temple, bikos to kom meet God make E tish yu, betta pass foolish sakrifice and pipol wey dey offa am, nor know sey wetin dem dey do, nor good.
Make yu tink well-well before yu tok or before yu make promise give God. God dey heaven and yu dey dis eart, so make yu nor dey tok too mush.
Too mush tinkin dey kause bad dream and di more yu tok, di more yu go dey tok like fool.
Wen yu promise God sometin, make yu do am kwik-kwik, bikos E nor get anytin to do with fools. So make yu do wetin yu promise.
E betta make yu nor promise dan to make promise wey yu nor go fit keep or pay.
Nor allow yor mout make yu sin and nor go defend yorsef give pastor sey, “Na mistake I take make di promise.” Dat kind tin go make God vex for yu and E fit distroy evritin wey yu don work for!
Bikos many dreams and tok-tok nor mean anytin, so make yu dey fear God.
Nor sopraiz wen dem dey opress poor pipol or as bad judgement dey kover good judgement. Dis na bikos, di lowa ofisas must do wetin dia senior ofisas orda dem to do.
Na evribody dey enjoy wetin di land dey produce; even king dey put hope for wetin dem harvest from farm.
Pipol wey like money, even di one wey dem get, nor dey rish dem and doz wey like propaty, wetin dem get, nor dey rish dem too. Dis kind behaviour dey yuzles too.
Di more yu get, di more pipol go kom help yu spend am; di only gain for inside, na sey yu get money.
Pipol wey dey work hard, dey sleep well for nite; weda dem chop small or plenty food. But pipol wey too rish, nor dey even fit sleep at-all.
E get anoda sirious problem wey I don si for dis world. Pesin money fit bring wahala for am.
E go put am for bad business kon luz evritin. For di end, nor-tin remain to leave for en shidren.
Just as pesin kom out from en mama belle naked, na so too e go-go back naked and e nor go karry anytin follow body.
Dis one too na anoda sirious problem. Just as pesin take kom, na so too e go take go back. And dia hard work na for nor-tin, e just bi like wen yu dey try to katch breeze.
Wen e dey alive, na darkness e for dey chop and na pain and sickness full en body.
I still don notis one tin, at least, dis one dey good: E good for pipol to chop, drink and enjoy dia work for di short time wey God give dem to live dia life, bikos na so God wont am.
E still good wen God bless yu with money, propaty and good health wey yu go take enjoy dem. To enjoy yor work and asept di life wey God give yu, na big gift from God.
God dey always make dat kind pesin enjoy en life and e nor dey worry about anytin.E get anoda sirious tin wey I don still si for dis world and e dey show for pipol life.
God dey give some pipol many propaty, honor and evritin wey dem wont, but E nor dey give dem di shance to enjoy dem. Dem go die, den anoda pesin go help dem enjoy dia propaty! Dis one dey yuzles and bad well-well.
If pesin get hundred shidren and e stay for dis life kon old, but if e nor get happiness and dem nor do betta beri for am, den I go sey, “Pikin wey dem just born and e die, betta pass am.”
E for betta sey dem nor born dat pikin, bikos en life disappear enter darkness. E nor even get name.
E nor ever si day lite or know wetin life bi, but at least, e get rest
pass di man wey stay 2,000 years for dis world and e nor ever enjoy am. Afta all, di two of dem dey go di same place.
Pipol dey work just bikos of wetin dem go chop, but dem still nor dey beleful.
So, how wise pipol take betta pass pipol wey bi fool? Poor pesin wey sabi work well-well, wetin e go gain for dis life?
So, make yu enjoy wetin yu get, instead of wetin yu wont and stop to dream of tins wey dey yuzles, like pesin wey dey porshu breeze.
Evritin wey dey happen, na wetin God don sey go happen and all of us know sey, yu nor go fit argue with pesin wey strong pass yu.
Bikos di more pesin dey argue, di more en word nor dey mean anytin, so how dat one go take benefit anybody?
Who know wetin good for pesin for dis yuzles and short life wey wi dey live? Life wey bi like shadow, how wi won take know wetin go happen for di world afta wi don die?To get good name betta pass perfume wey dear well-well and di day wen pesin die, betta pass di day wen dem born am.
E betta to go house where dem for dey kry dan to go where dem for dey celebrate; bikos evribody go die one day. So make pipol wey still dey alive put dis one for dia mind.
E betta make pesin dey tink about life, dan sey e dey laf anyhow. Bikos to dey tink and dey kwayet, good well-well for di heart.
Pesin wey always dey tink about happiness, na fool, but pesin wey get sense, go still dey tink about deat too.
E betta make wise pesin korrect yu dan make fool praiz yu.
Bikos just as shuku-shuku dey burn for fire, na so fool life bi. Dis one too dey yuzles.
True-true, opreshon fit turn wise man to fool, just as bribe dey korrupt di mind.
To finish anytin wey yu start, betta pass wen yu start am, just as to dey patient betta pass to dey proud.
Always dey kontrol yor tempa, bikos vexnashon go turn yu to fool.
Nor ever ask, “Wetin make evritin bad dis days pass as dem bi before?” Bikos e nor dey wise to ask dat kind kweshon.
Wisdom dey sweet well-well wen money dey, bikos both wisdom and money dey good well-well for dis life.
Wisdom and money fit give yu anytin wey yu wont for life, but na only wisdom fit save yor life.
Make yu asept di way God kreate tins; abi e get who go fit strait wetin God don bend?
Wen God give yu money, make yu tank God and enjoy am, but wen sofa kom, make yu know sey e still kom from God too, bikos nobody go fit tok how tumoro go bi.
I don si evritin for dis yuzles life; good yong pipol wey kwik die before dia time and wiked pipol wey dey get long life.
So make yu nor dey too good or too wise, if not e go distroy yu!
Make yu nor dey too wiked or bihave like fool, if not, yu fit die before yor time!
But make yu listin to all dis warnin, bikos anybody wey dey fear God, go dey save.
Pesin wey wise, strong pass ten pipol wey dey rule di town,
bikos e nor get anybody for dis world wey dey good well-well and nor dey sin.
So, make yu nor listin to wetin pipol dey tok, if not, yu go hear yor savant dey curse yu,
bikos yu know for yor own heart too, how many times yusef don curse oda pipol.
I dey always try my best make wisdom guide wetin I dey tink and evritin wey I dey do. Den I tell mysef, “I dey ready to learn” but I nor fit undastand am at-all.
Evritin wey don happen, too hard for human being to undastand; dem too deep for us to tink about.
So I try to search evriwhere to get wisdom and to undastand why tins dey happen di way dem dey happen and I dey ready to prove to mysef sey, wikedness dey stupid and foolishness dey bring madness.
I still si sey, woman wey wont make man sleep with am, dey set trap for am and dis one dey wiked and bad pass deat. Pipol wey dey obey God, go fit eskape am, but doz wey dey sin, go enter di trap.
Di Tisha sey: “I undastand all dis tins wen I dey try to look for ansa to evritin.
“Wetin I dey find since, I neva still si am; I si sey among 1,000 pipol, na only one man dey good, but I nor si any woman wey good among dem.
But I still learn dis one too: God kreate evribody make dem dey good, but dem don dey do wiked tins as dem like.”Na who wise and get sense? Na Who know di ansa to dis problem? Wisdom dey make pesin smile and remove vexnashon from en face.
So since yu don promise God sey yu go dey loyal to am, den make yu obey di king kommand.
Make yu nor rush komot from di king present; nor put yor hand for bad tin, bikos di king fit do anytin wey e like.
Anytin wey e kommand, pawa dey follow am and nobody go fit go against or kweshon en authority.
Di king nor go ponish pesin wey dey obey am and doz wey dey wise, go find di way and time to do wetin dey good.
E get time and how to do tins; bikos di king ponishment dey strong well-well.
True-true, nobody know tumoro and nobody fit tell anoda pesin wetin go happen tumoro.
Wi nor fit kontrol breeze or tok di day wen wi go die. Dat na one war wey wi nor fit run from and wikedness nor go fit save doz wey dey do evil.
All dis tins wey dey happen for dis world, I don tink about dem well-well kon si sey time dey for pesin to opress en neighbour as e like.
I si as dem beri wiked pipol with honor, but God pipol dey komot di holy town and pipol dey forget dem. All dis tins nor make sense at-all.
Wen dem nor kwik ponish pesin wey do bad, pipol go tink sey e dey good to do bad.
If pipol wey sin hundred times still get long life, den I know sey pipol wey dey fear God, na dia life go long pass.
But wiked pipol nor go prosper, bikos dem nor dey fear God. Dia life go kwik finish like pesin shadow.
E still get oda yuzles tins for dis world: Sometaims, wi dey trit good pipol like sey dem wiked, den trit wiked pipol like sey dem dey good and na dis dey yuzles pass.
So I sey make wi dey enjoy awasef, bikos di only good tin for dis world na to dey chop, drink and enjoy awa short life. Na so wi go take enjoy di happiness and hard work wey God give us to do for dis world.
But for day and nite, I nor dey sleep bikos I dey try to undastand wetin dey happen for dis world.
I notis sey nobody go fit know evritin wey God dey do for dis world. Aldo wise pipol fit klaim sey dem know, but dem nor know anytin at-all.So as I sidan dey tink dis tins make I for undastand dem, I kon si sey, na God dey kontrol evritin wey raitious and wise pipol dey do. Even doh wi like or hate anytin, nobody know wetin go happen for future.
Weda wi dey raitious or wiked; good or bad; dey klean or not; dey offa sakrifice or not, na di same tin go happen to all of us, bikos pesin wey good nor betta pass sina and pipol wey dey make promise give God, nor betta pass doz wey nor dey make.
Dis na di bad part about evritin wey dey happen for dis world: na di same tin go happen to evribody. Plus dis sef, na wikedness full human being mind and na wetin dem like dem dey do, den one day, dem go die.
But doz wey dey alive get hope, bikos dog wey dey alive, betta pass lion wey don die!
Pipol wey dey alive naw, know sey one day dem go die, but pipol wey don die, nor know anytin and dem nor get any reward again; pipol nor dey remember dem again.
Evritin wey dem do wen dem still dey alive, weda dem love, hate or bin dey jealous pesin, all don die follow dem go. Dem nor get part for anytin wey dey happen for dis world again.
So, make wi kontinue to chop with joy and drink with happiness for awa heart, bikos God don already asept awa work.
Make wi always let awa klot dey klean and spray betta perfume for body!
So as far as wi dey live dis yuzles life wey God give us, make wi enjoy am with awa wife, bikos dat na awa reward for all di trobol wey wi dey face for dis world.
So, anytin wey yu dey do, make yu do am well, bikos wons yu die, yor wisdom, knowledge, work and plans, nor go mean anytin again.
I don still notis anoda tin for dis world sey; nor bi who run pass dey always win di race and nor bi di sojas wey strong pass, dey always win di war. Wise pipol dey hongry sometaims and just as pipol wey dey work hard nor dey always get money, na so too pipol wey know book nor dey always get betta life. All dis tins dey happen by shance, as long as yu dey di rite place for di rite time.
True-true, nobody know di time wen dis tins go happen! Like fish wey net katch or bird wey enter trap, na so too, wahala just dey kom meet pipol by sopraiz.
Dis na anoda tin wey I don si about wisdom and I like am, bikos of di way tins dey happen for dis world.
E get one town and di pipol wey dey inside nor many. Den one king wey get pawa well-well bring en sojas kon attack dem.
But one poor wise man for der, know wetin to do, so dat di town go dey save. So e do am kon save evribody. But afta, nobody tink am for dia heart sey, make dem tank di man.
So I kon si sey, wisdom betta pass pawa, but nobody go respet wise man wey poor; nobody go gri listin to en advise bikos e nor get money.
Wise pipol nor dey shaut wen dem dey tok and dis betta pass king wey dey shaut and tok to fools.
So wisdom dey good pass swod, but one sin fit distroy many-many good tins.Just as fly wey don die dey make perfume smell, na so too small foolishness dey spoil pesin wisdom and respet.
Wise man sense dey protet am, but di sense wey fools get, dey put dem for wahala
and even wen foolish pesin dey waka for road, e dey know and show evribody sey e bi fool!
If yor oga dey vex for yu, make yu nor vex stop di work wey yu dey do, bikos gentol spirit dey korrect big mistake.
E get anoda bad tin wey I don si for dis world and na big mistake wey kings dey make,
bikos dem go give betta pozishon to fools kon put wise pipol for di yeye ones.
I don even si where savant dey ride horse like sey e bi prince, while prince dey waka like sey e bi savant!
Anybody wey dig pit for odas, go fall enter by ensef and pesin wey break wall pass, snake go bite am.
Anybody wey dey work for where dem dey kut stones, di stones fit fall press am. If yu dey kut wood, di axe fit still wound yu too.
Yu go nid to use more pawa take kut wood if di axe wey yu dey use nor sharp, so make yu sharp di axe well. Dis na di value wey dey wisdom and e go help yu susid.
If snake bite pesin before dem sharm am, den e nor get nid to koll di pesin wey dey sharm snake.
Wise pesin word dey favor am, but fool own, dey distroy am,
and na only yeye tins fools dey tok and na madness dey end am,
bikos dem go just dey tok anyhow waka. So, nobody really know wetin go happen naw or di ones wey go happen for future.
Foolish pesin work dey kwik taya am, bikos e nor even know road to follow go en house.
E go bad for any town wey dia king dey tink like small pikin and dia leaders dey always do party till day break.
Kountry wey en king get betta karata, wey en leaders dey chop for di rite time, so dat dem go get pawa and nor dey drink anyhow, na blessing go follow dem.
Na so too, wen pesin too lazy to ripair en house, wen en zink dey leak, di house go fall.
Party na to make pesin happy and to dey drink wine dey bring joy, but na money dey ansa evritin!
Make yu nor curse di king for yor mind or curse rish pipol for yor room, bikos one small bird fit karry wetin yu dey tok and tink, go tell dem.Put yor money for betta business and e nor go tey before yu go bigin gain am.
But e betta if yu put am for many business, bikos yu nor know where wahala go from kom.
If wota full di kloud, den rain must surely fall for di eart and weda tree fall go nort or sout, di tree must stay for where e fall put.
Any farmer wey dey wait for betta weda, nor go ever plant seed and if e dey look di kloud to know weda rain go fall, e nor go ever harvest wetin e plant.
Just as yu nor go fit undastand how breeze dey blow or how pikin take dey grow for en mama belle, na so too yu nor go fit undastand how God take make evritin.
So, make yu go plant yor seed for morning and nor stop to work until evening; bikos yu nor know di one wey yu do wey go bring gain for yu; weda na dis one, dat one or di two.
Lite sweet well-well and e dey good to si anoda new day.
So if pesin get long life, make e dey happy as e dey live di life. But make e still know sey, di days wey darkness go dey, many well-well and evritin wey go still happen, dey yuzles.
Yong man, make yu happy as yu dey yong! Make yu enjoy evry minute for dis life and do evritin wey yu won do; but remember sey yu go tell God evritin wey yu dey do.
So, anytin wey go make yu sin, make yu remove dem from yor mind, so dat yor body go dey strong, bikos yong life na for enjoyment. But remember sey yu nor go yong forever o-o.So, make yu remember and honor di Pesin wey kreate yu naw wen yu still dey yong, bikos wen yu don old, yu go sey, “Life nor sweet again.”
Remember am before di sun, moon and stars go dark and before kloud disappear wen rain don fall finish.
Remember am before doz wey dey guide yor house bigin shake with fear. Dat time, yor strong men go don dey weak. Make yu remember am naw, before yor tit go pul finish and yor eyes nor go fit si well again.
Remember am naw, before life opportunity door go klose and work nois go fade komot yor ear. Naw, yu dey wake-up with bird nois, but den, all di sound go dey komot small-small from yor ear.
Remember am naw, before yu go kon dey fear to klimb high place or to waka for road; den yor hair go don turn white like almond tree wey dey shine and yu go hardli fit karry yorsef just like grasshoppa wey dey die; den all di mind to dey sleep with woman or man, go vanish and small time, yu go-go yor final resting place, den pipol go mourn for di street for yu.
Yes! Make yu remember di Pesin wey kreate yu naw wen yu dey yong, before di silva shain go kut and di gold lamp go fall break. Nor wait until di wota pot go skata or di rope for di well go kut.
By den, yor body go-go back to groun where e from kom, while di spirit go-go back go meet God wey bin gi-am to yu.
So di tisha sey, “Evritin dey yuzles. Yes! Dem yuzles well-well.”
Nor bi sey na only sense di tisha get, but e still dey tish di pipol how to get wisdom. E take en time take tish and show dem many proverbs.
Di tisha kon try to find good words wey go make us know di trut;
bikos word wey wise pesin tok, bi like di sharp stik wey shepad dey use and wise words bi like word wey dem nail well for wall and na God bi di Shepad wey give us all dis tins.
But my pikin, make I warn yu: nor add join dis words; bikos pipol go still dey rite many book and too mush readin, go make yu kwik old.
So, since yu don hear evritin, dis na my last advise: “Make yu fear God and obey all en kommands, bikos na wetin man suppose do, bi dat.”
For evritin wey wi dey do, make wi know sey God go judge us; even di ones wey wi do for sekret, weda dem dey good or bad.
