Na Paul, Jesus Christ apostle rite dis leta, bikos na so God wont am, so dat I go prish about di life wey God promise us thru Christ.
To Timoti, my pikin wey I love. Make grace, mesi and peace dey with yu from God awa Papa and awa Oga God Jesus Christ.
Anytime I remember yu for my prayer, weda na for nite or day time, I dey always tank God wey I dey serve with betta mind, just as my grand-grand papa dem serve am.
Wen I remember as yu take kry, e dey hongry mi to kom si yu, so dat joy go full my mind.
I always dey remember di faith wey yu first get from yor grand-mama, Lois and from yor mama, Eunice. I dey sure sey e dey inside yu.
Na dis make mi dey remind yu sey, make yu dey use God gift wey yu get well and yu receive dis gift afta I lay hand for yor head.
Bikos God nor give us di spirit wey go make us fear, but di spirit wey E give us, get pawa, love and sef kontrol.
So make yu dey proud to tok about Christ or about mi wey dey prison bikos of am and make yu use di pawa wey God give yu, take follow mi sofa for dis gospel.
Bikos God save and koll us to live holy life. E do like dis, nor bi sey wi deserve am bikos of wetin wi do, but na so E plan am even before di world start, so dat wey go know en grace thru Jesus Christ.
But naw, E don bring all dis plan out wen awa Oga God Jesus Christ kom dis world. E distroy deat pawa kon bring life wey nor dey end thru di gospel.
Na dis gospel make God choose mi as prisha, apostle and tisha.
And naim make mi dey sofa wetin I dey sofa so. But I nor dey shame, bikos I know di Pesin wey I dey serve and I dey sure sey, E go guide di tin wey I gi-am whole, until di day wey Christ go kom.
Make yu kontinue with di word wey I tell yu kon dey do am with di faith and love wey dey inside Christ.
Make yu guide di good tins wey God give yu thru di Holy Spirit wey dey inside us.
Yu know sey evribody for Asia, Figelus and Hermogenes aria, don run leave mi.
Make God show en mesi to Onesiforus family, bikos e dey always make mi happy and e nor dey shame sey I dey prison.
Wen e kom Rome, e find mi for evriwhere until e si mi.
For di day wen Christ go kom, make e show am en mesi! And yu know how e help mi wen I dey Efesus.So yu, my pikin, make yu dey strong for di grace wey Christ dey give.
Di tins wey yu hear mi tok for pipol present, make yu tish oda pipol wey yu trust sey dem dey ready to tish odas.
Make yu dey ready to sofa as mi and odas dey sofa, so dat yu go bi good soja for Christ.
Nor-tin koncern sojas with tins wey ordinary pipol dey do; if not, e nor go do wetin en oga wont.
Bikos anybody wey dey run race, nor go fit win unless e follow di rule wey dey di game.
Farmer wey work well-well, naim suppose get di first share for di harvest.
Make yu tink about wetin I dey tok so and Christ go help yu to undastand evritin.
Remember Jesus Christ wey kom from David family; di pesin wey God raiz from deat; bikos na so e bi for di message wey I dey prish
and na dis Good News make mi dey sofa, sotey dem kon put mi for prison like tif; but dem nor fit put God word for prison!
So I dey ready to bear di sofa, as long as e go save doz wey God don choose inside Christ with glory wey go dey forever and ever.
Dis word na true: If wi die with am, wi go live with am too.
If wi bear with am, den wi go reign with am too and if wi sey wi nor know am, en too go sey, e nor know us.
Weda wi get faith for am or not, Christ go still bi who e bi and e nor go shange.
Make yu remind evribody about dis tins, den make yu kommand dem for God present sey, make dem nor dey argue about words, bikos doz kind tins nor dey good and e fit konfuse doz wey dey listin.
Make yu do evritin wey yu fit do, so dat God go si yu as betta pesin. Dey do yor work well as pesin wey nor dey shame, but dey ready to esplain God word wey bi trut.
Make yu nor put mout for yeye tok, bikos pipol wey dey do doz tins, dey far from God.
Dia word dey spread like diziz and na dis tin happen to Hymenaeus and Filetus.
Dem leave di trut kon dey sey resureshon don happen already and like dis, dem don make some pipol fall from di faith.
But God strong foundashon still stand and dem rite put sey, “God know en pipol and evribody wey bi Christ own, must stop to do evil.”
Wen yu go rish man house, nor bi only gold and silva tins dey der, but tins wey dem use wood and klay take make still dey der too and some dey make di house fine and odas nor good at-all.
So if yu keep yorsef without fault, yu go bi betta pesin wey Christ fit use as e dey do en good work.
Make yu run from doz tins wey dey hongry yong pipol to do, so dat yu go please God forever. Den yu go fit love and stay for peace with odas wey dey serve God with klean heart.
I dey tell yu again sey, make yu nor put mout for yeye word, bikos yu know sey dis kind tin dey kause kworel.
Pesin wey bi Christ savant nor dey kworel, instead e must dey good with evribody; must sabi tish well-well and get patient with sturbon pipol.
E must dey gentol as e dey korrect pipol wey dey oppoz en prishin and God fit let dis pipol turn from sin kom meet am, so dat dem go know di trut.
Den dia sense go korrect and dem nor go fall enter devil trap again. Bikos devil don katch dem put inside en trap before, so dem dey do anytin wey e wont.Make yu undastand sey, for di last days before dis world go end, tins go hard well- well.
Pipol go dey tink of diasef alone; dey like money; dey boast; dey karry body up; dey tok bad about God; dey disobey dia papa and mama and dem nor dey tank even pipol wey do good for dem.
Dem nor get love or forgivenes; dem go dey gossip odas and nor fit kontrol diasef. Dem go dey wiked and hate wetin good.
Dem go betray dia friends; dey do tins before dem tink; dey feel sey dem dey important and dem go love enjoyment pass God.
If yu look dem well-well, dem bi like God pipol, but dem don rijet God pawa. So make yu run from dis kind pipol.
Bikos na dis pipol dey hide enter pipol house kon sleep with wimen wey nor get sense; wey dey sin well-well and wetin dey sweet dis wimen to do, na-im dey kontrol dem.
Doz kind wimen dey try to learn, but dem nor dey fit know di trut.
Just as Jannes and Jambres oppoz Moses; na so too, dis pipol wey dia mind block and nor get faith, dey oppoz di trut.
But dem nor go do am tey, bikos evribody go si how dem foolish rish, just as e happen to Jannes and Jambres.
But yu don know my tishings; di way I dey live my life and why I dey do wetin I dey do: my faith; patient; love and as I dey bear.
Yu know di wahala and sofa wey happen to mi for Antiok, Ikonium and for Lystra. I bear all dis wahala and Christ save mi from dem.
True-true, anybody wey won live di kind life wey God wont inside Christ, make e know sey e must sofa.
But wiked and evil pipol nor go prosper. Dem go deceive odas and dem go deceive diasef too.
But make yu kontinue to do wetin yu learn. Yu know sey dis tins na true and yu trust doz wey tish yu.
Dem don tish yu God word since yu bi small pikin and yu don get salvashon to receive di wisdom wey dey kom thru Christ, wey yu trust.
Evry word wey dey Bible, kom from God and dem dey good to tish us di trut and to know di tins wey dey wrong for awa life. God word dey korrect us wen wi dey wrong and e dey tish us to do good tins,
so dat as wi dey do God work, wi go fit do am well and wi go get evritin wey wi nid to take do good tins.I dey tell yu wetin to do for God and Jesus Christ present. Wen Christ go appear to make en kingdom stand, e go judge pipol wey dey alive and doz wey don die.
Make yu dey prish God word and dey ready, weda di time dey okay or not. Make yu use patient take korrect and enkourage yor pipol with betta tishing.
Bikos time dey kom wen pipol nor go won hear good and betta tishing again. Instead, dem go dey follow wetin dey hongry dem to do kon dey find tisha wey go tish dem wetin dem won hear.
Dem go rijet di trut and love lie-lie story.
But make yu kontrol yorsef for evritin. Nor fear to sofa for Christ. Dey do God work and dey tell odas about di Good News.
For mi, I don already use my life as ofrin for God work, bikos di time wey I go die, don near.
I don fight di good fight for di faith wey I get; I don run di race finish; I don do wetin I promise sey I go do.
Naw, di prize for raitiousness dey wait mi and na God wey dey judge rite go give mi dis prize for di day wen Christ go kom. Di prize nor bi for mi alone, but na for evribody wey dey wait for Christ to kom back.
Make yu try yor best to kom si mi soon.
Bikos Demas love dis world tins, e kon run leave mi go Tesalonika. Crescens don go Galatia and Titus go Dalmatia.
Na only Luke dey with mi. Make yu karry Mark follow body wen yu dey kom, bikos e go fit help mi for di ministry work.

Make yu dey kareful with am, bikos e fight against evritin wey wi tok.
Di first time wen dem karry mi go kourt, evribody abandon mi and all of dem run leave mi. Make God nor judge dem bikos of wetin dem do!
But God dey for my side and E give mi pawa, so dat thru mi, Gentile pipol go hear di Good News and Christ don save mi from lion mout!
And Christ go still save mi from evry evil plan until e take mi enter en kingdom. Make glory bi en own forever and ever. Amen!
