Solomon, David pikin wey bi king for Israel, na-im rite all dis wise word.
E rite dem so dat pipol go get wisdom, undastandin and good advise.
Dis words go tish una how to live betta life, to dey honest and to dey tok trut and korrect word.
Dis words fit make pesin wey nor know anytin get sense and e go tish yong men how to work and get money.
Make doz wey get sense listin to dis words kon wise more and make e guide doz wey get undastandin,
so dat dem go fit undastand proverbs, parabols and wetin wise pipol dey tok.
For yu to get wisdom, yu most fear God, but na only foolish pipol dey rijet wisdom and good advise.
My pikin, make yu listin wen yor papa dey korrect yu and follow wetin yor mama dey tish yu,
bikos wetin dem dey tish yu go bi like betta shain for yor neck and betta kap for yor head.
My pikin, wen sinnas tempt yu, make yu nor fall for dem.
If dem tell yu sey, “Kom make wi go kill pesin! Make wi just go attack some innocent pipol!” Make yu nor listin to dem.
If dem sey, “Even doh di pipol dey alive and okay naw, dem go die wen wi don deal with dem finish!
Den wi go si plenty good tins karry kom awa house.
So, kom join us make wi go divide wetin wi tif.”
My pikin, make yu nor follow dat kind pipol or go near dem at-all.
Bikos dem dey enjoy to do bad tin and dem always dey ready to kill.
E nor dey good to set trap wen di bird wey yu won katch dey look yu.
But pipol wey dey do like dat, dey set trap for demsef and na di trap go kill dem.
Dis na wetin dey happen to pipol wey play wayo take get propaty.
Wisdom dey koll pipol for street and inside market,
e dey shaut dey koll dem from di town gate and anywhere wey pipol gada put.
Pipol wey nor get sense, na how long una won take bi fool? Na how long una won take wisdom do yeye? Una nor won learn at-all?
How I wish una go gri listin, den I for give una good advise kon share my wisdom with una.
I dey koll and invite una since, but una nor gri listin or hear mi.
Una nor gri take my advise or allow mi korrect una.
So, I go laf una wen una enter trobol kon take una do yeye wen wahala start.
Dat time, trobol go kom meet una like heavy breeze and una pain go sirious well-well.
Dat time, una go koll mi wey bi wisdom, but I nor go ansa. Una fit go find mi for evriwhere, but una nor go si mi.
Una nor ever get wetin to do with wisdom and una nor gri obey God.
Una nor wont my advise or listin to mi wen I dey korrect una.
So, una go get wetin fit una and wetin una do, go make una sick.
Pipol wey nor know anytin, dey die bikos dem rijet wisdom and distroshon go follow doz wey bi fool, bikos dem feel sey wisdom nor koncern dem.
But anybody wey listin to mi, go dey save and e nor go get rizin to fear.My pikin, make yu listin to wetin I dey tish yu and nor ever forget wetin I sey make yu do.
Listin to wetin dey wise and try make yu undastand am.
Yes, make yu beg for wisdom and yu go get undastandin.
Find am well-well, just as yu go take look for silva or oda good tins.
If yu do like dat, yu go know wetin e mean to fear God and yu go susid as yu dey learn about God.
Na God dey give wisdom! Na from en mout knowledge and undastandin dey from kom.
E dey help and protet raitious and honest pipol.

So, if yu listin to wetin I dey tok; yu go know wetin dey rite, true and korrect, den kon know wetin yu suppose do.
Yu go dey wise and di sense wey yu get go give yu happiness.
Di sense and undastandin wey yu go get, go protet yu.
Wisdom go save yu from wiked pipol; from doz wey dey lie well-well.
From pipol wey live good life before dem bigin do bad-bad tins;
and dem dey happy to do yeye and wiked tins.
E go still save yu from pipol wey dem nor fit trust;
from ashawo wimen wey get sweet mout and doz wey won sleep with yu.
Dis kind woman nor dey faithful to en husband and e don forget di holy promise wey e make.
If yu go en house, yu just won kill yorsef bi dat.
Nobody wey go visit am, dey kom back alive. True-true, e nor go ever kom back to life again.
So, make yu follow wetin good pipol dey do, so dat yu go fit live betta life.
Raitious pipol and doz wey get respet go stay for di land wey bi awa own.
But just as dem dey rut plant komot for groun, na so God too go porshu wiked pipol kon rut sinnas komot from di land.My pikin, make yu nor forget wetin I tish yu and always remember wetin I sey make yu dey do.
Wetin I tish yu go make yu prosper and get long life.
So make yu always get faith and dey honbol; tie trut and mesi round yor neck kon rite dem for yor heart.
If yu do like dat, both God and human being go dey happy and favor yu.
Make yu always dey trust God with all yor heart, but nor trust wetin yu tink sey yu know.
Always dey remember God kommand for anytin wey yu dey do, den E go show yu di korrect way.
Nor tink sey yu wise pass di way yu bi, but just obey God and nor do bad tins.
If yu do like dis, yor body go dey okay and yor bones go strong well-well.

If yu do so, korn go full yor store and yu go get plenty wine to keep.
My pikin, if God korrect yu, listin well and take am as warnin.
Bikos God dey korrect only di pipol wey E love, just as papa dey korrect di pikin wey e dey proud of.
Pesin wey wise and get undastandin, na happiness go bi en own.
Undastandin get gain pass silva and e betta pass gold.
Wisdom get value pass gold and e nor get anytin wey yu fit use take kompare am.
E go give yu long life, plenty propaty and honor.
E go still make yor life sweet and yu go dey save.
Wisdom na tree wey dey give life and e dey make pipol wey kom meet am, happy.

God go save yu and E nor go let trap katch yu.
Anytime wey yu fit, make yu do good to pipol wey nid am.
Nor ever tell yor neighbour make e wait till tumoro, if yu know sey yu fit help am naw.
Nor ever plan bad against yor neighbour, bikos doz wey dey stay near yu, trust yu.
Nor argue with pesin just bikos yu won argue, wen yu know sey e nor do yu bad.
Nor jealous or bigin bihave like pipol wey like wahala well-well,

God don curse wiked pipol house, while blessings full raitious pipol own.
God nor get wetin E won do with proud pipol, but E dey favor pipol wey dey honbol.
Pipol wey wise go get good name, but fools go only add trobol join dia disgrace.My pikin, make yu listin to wetin yor papa dey tish yu; put yor ear down and yu go undastand.
Remember evritin wey I dey tish yu, bikos dem dey good.
Wen I still bi small boy for my papa house and as my mama only pikin,
my papa go tell mi, “Make yu always remember wetin I tish yu. Do wetin I tok and yu go get long life.
Ask for wisdom and undastandin! Nor forget or abandon wetin I tok.
If yu love wisdom, e go protet yu; if yu love am well-well, e go save yu.
Na wisdom bi di best tin to get. If yu go get any oda tin, make e bi undastandin.
Love wisdom and e go make yu great; draw am near body and e go bring respet for yu.
Wisdom go give yu grace, e go bi like fine crown for yor head.”
So my pikin! Make yu listin to mi; make yu take evritin wey I dey tell yu sirious, den yu go get long life.
I don tish yu wisdom and di korrect way to live yor life.
Nor-tin go stand for yor way if yu dey live wise life, den yu nor go fall wen yu dey run.
Make yu always remember evritin wey yu don learn, bikos na wetin yu learn go give yu good life, so make yu guide am well-well.
Nor go where wiked men gada put or follow wetin dem dey do.
Nor do or go near bad tin! Make yu rijet am kon go yor way.
Wiked pipol nor dey fit sleep until dem do bad tin. Dem nor go gri rest until dem wound pesin.
Wikedness and wahala bi like food and drink to dem.
Raitious pipol ways bi like sun for morning wey dey shine well-well go rish evening.
But wiked pipol road dark well-well; dem go fall and dem nor go si wetin make dem fall.
So, my pikin, make yu hear wetin I dey tok kon listin to my words.
Nor ever let dis words leave yu, remember and protet dem with yor heart.
Bikos dem dey give life and betta body to anybody wey undastand dem.
Make yu dey kareful about wetin yu dey tink, bikos na wetin yu tink for yor heart, yu go do.
Nor ever lie. Nor do anytin with pipol wey dey lie or tok bad words.
Make yu look strait and nor bow yor head, bikos yu dey shame.
Anytin wey yu won do, make yu plan am well, den evritin wey yu do go dey okay.
Make yu run from bad tins kon waka for strait road, so dat yu nor go turn go left or rite.My pikin, make yu listin to my wisdom and put yor ear down for di words wey I dey tish yu.
Den yu go know how to bihave well and di way yu go dey tok, go show sey yu get wisdom.
Anoda man wife lip fit sweet like honey and en kiss dey smooth like oil,
but wen evritin don finish, yu nor go gain anytin inside escept pain and bitterness.
Di woman go take yu go where dead body dey, bikos dat road dey lead to deat.
Di woman nor dey tink about di road wey dey save; e dey waka lost but e nor know.
But my pikin, make yu listin to mi and nor forget wetin I dey tok.
Run from dat kind woman; nor even go near en door.
If yu follow am, nobody go respet yu again and strenjas go take evritin wey yu get.
Yes! Strenjas go take all yor propaty and anoda pesin go kollect evritin wey yu work for.
Den for di end, yu go kry with pains kon die go like dat.
Den yu go sey, “Why I nor follow wetin dem tish mi? Why I nor let dem korrect mi?
Why I nor obey my tishas! Why I nor do wetin dem tok?
Naw, na wons dem disgrace mi for publik.”
Just as yu go take wota from yor own well, na so too make yu dey faithful and love only yor wife.
Make yu nor just bi like river wey anybody fit drink from.
Make yu keep yorsef for yor wife alone and know bi for strenjas.
So always dey happy with yor wife and find joy for di woman wey yu marry from di biginnin,
bikos e fine and dey honbol like deer. Make en smile dey make yu happy and make en love satisfy yu.
My pikin, why yu go-go give yor love to anoda woman? Wetin make yu like di way anoda man wife bi?
God dey si evritin wey yu dey do and E know evriwhere wey yu dey go.
Wiked man sins na trap, bikos na en own sin net, go katch.
E go die bikos e nor fit kontrol ensef. Na en yeye life go send am go en grave.My pikin, if yu gri sey yu go pay di debt wey yor friend owe
and dem kon owe yu for di promise wey yu make,
make yu follow dis my advise, so dat yu go free yorsef, bikos yu don fall enter yor neighbour hand bi dat. Just go honbol yorsef and beg yor neighbour, so dat e go free yu.
Make yu do as I tell yu before sleep go katch yu! Nor rest until yu do am.
Just try komot yorsef from di trap like bird wey komot from trap or like deer wey eskape from hunta.
Lazy pipol, make una learn lesin from di way ant dey live dia life.
Dem nor get leader, govnor or who dey rule dem,
but dem dey store dia food for dry sizin, dey wait for wen rainin sizin go start.
But na how long lazy man go take dey liedan for en bed? Wen e go ever get up?
E go sey, “Make I just sleep; fold my hand and rest small.”
But as e dey sleep, evritin wey e get go vanish like sey na tif karry dem go.
Wetin yuzles and wiked pipol bi like? Na lie dem just dey lie waka.
Dem go use dia eyes take make sign kon use dia legs and fingers take deceive pipol.
Na bad plans full dia heart and na so-so trobol dem dey kause.
Bikos of dis, dem nor go know before wahala go kom meet and distroy dem finish.
E get seven tins wey God hate and E nor wont make anybody do dem and dem bi:
“Proud pipol; doz wey dey lie; doz wey dey kill innocent pipol;
pipol wey dey always tink bad tins; pipol wey dey rush to go do wiked tins;
doz wey dey lie for anoda pesin head and pipol wey dey kause trobol among dia friends.”
My pikin, make yu do wetin yor papa tell yu and nor ever forget wetin yor mama tish yu.
Always keep and lock dia words for yor heart! Tie dem round yor neck too.
Wetin dem tish yu so, go lead yu wen yu dey waka, protet yu for nite kon give yu good advise for day time.
Wetin dem sey make yu do, bi like lite and dia korreshon go fit tish yu how to live yor life.
E go keep yu from bad wimen and from di sweet-sweet words wey oda men wife dey tok.
Nor let dia beauti tempt yu and nor let dia wayo eyes make yu fall.
Bikos to sleep with ashawo fit make man poor, but to sleep with anoda man wife go make yu luz yor life.
Yu fit put fire for yor chest make e nor burn yu?
Abi yu fit waka on-top hot shako make e nor burn yor leg?
Na so e go bi too, if yu sleep with anoda man wife and anybody wey do dat kind tin, go sofa.
Pipol fit sorry for pesin wen e tif bikos e dey hongry
but if dem katch am, e must pay back wetin e tif seven times, even if e nid to sell evritin wey e get.
But man wey dey sleep with anoda pesin wife, nor get sense at-all and e just dey distroy ensef by ensef.
Pipol go hate, beat and disgrace am and shame go follow am forever.
Bikos jealousy dey make husband vex well-well and e nor dey show mesi wen e won revensh.
E nor go gri take any money and no amount of gift go stop en vexnashon.My pikin, make yu remember wetin I dey tok; nor forget wetin I sey make yu do.
Do wetin I tok and yu go get good life! Protet all wetin I tish yu just as yu go protet yor eye.
All wetin I tish yu, make dem always dey with yu and make yu rite dem for yor heart.
Trit wisdom like yor sista and undastandin like yor best friend.
Dem nor go make yu put eye for anoda man wife body and wimen wey get sweet mout.
One day, I dey look outside from my window
and I si many men wey nor get sense, but I notis one among dem wey foolish well-well.
E dey waka pass one road near di korna wey one woman dey stay. E waka near en house
for evening wen day don dark well-well.
Den di woman go meet am; e dress like ashawo and e get bad plan for mind.
Di woman dey tok anyhow and e nor dey shame, bikos e dey always waka for di street
or stand dey wait for korna and sometaims, e go dey di market side.
E trow en hand round di yong man neck, kiss am, look strait enter en eye kon sey,
“I get fresh meat for house and today, I don do wetin I promise.
Na dis make mi kom out kon look for yu and I don si yu!
I don dress my bed with fine kolour linen wey I bring from Egypt.
I don put myrrh, aloe and cinnamon perfume for di bed.
So, make yu kom! Make wi go sleep togeda till day break and wi go enjoy awasef.
Bikos my husband nor dey house; e don travel go far-far place.
E karry plenty money follow body and e nor go kom back until mont end.”
So e tempt di man with en beauti and di man fall for en sweet tok.
Small time, e bigin follow am like melu wey dem won go kill and like animal wey waka fast enter trap
where arrow go for enter en heart. E bi like bird wey dey enter net and e nor know sey en life dey danger.
So naw, my pikin, make yu listin and hear wetin I dey tok.
Nor let dat kind woman win yor heart; nor run follow am at-all.
Bikos e don skata many life and distroy and kill many men.
If yu enter en house, den deat dey hongry yu, bikos na short kut to deat bi dat.Make una hear mi! Wisdom dey koll pipol and undastandin wont make dem hear en vois.
Dem dey on-top di hill near di road! Dem stand for di oda side for di road.
Dem dey near di gate dey koll pipol wey dey enter di town sey:
“Wi dey beg and koll evribody wey dey di world.
Una wey nor know anytin, make una get wisdom. Una wey nor wise at-all, make una try get sense.
Make una listin to mi! I get betta words to tell una and na di rite words I dey tok so.
Wetin I dey tok so, na trut; bikos I nor dey lie.
Evritin wey I tok na true; I nor dey lie or dey lead una go die.
My words dey klear and evribody wey get wisdom, go undastand dem.
Instead of silva, make una take my words; make una choose wisdom, instead of di gold wey fine pass.
Na mi bi wisdom; I betta pass gold; nor-tin una wont wey good each mi.
I bi wisdom and I get sense well-well; I still get knowledge and I dey judge well.
If to sey una dey fear God, den una go hate bad tins. I hate pride, pipol wey dey tok anyhow, bad-bad tins and lie-lie words.
Kommon sense and suksess na my own. Na mi get undastandin and pawa.
I dey help kings rule well kon make rulers give korrect laws to dia pipol.
All di ruler for dis world dey rule with my help, even ofisas and prince dem too.
I love only doz wey love mi; anybody wey dey look for mi, go si mi.
I get propaty, honor, betta life and suksess to give pipol wey wont am.
Anytin wey una get from mi, betta pass di gold wey fine pass and silva wey pure well-well.
I dey follow korrect judgement and I always dey do wetin dey rite,
and doz wey love mi, I dey give and pak propaty full dia house.
From biginnin, na mi God first kreate, before E kreate evry oda tin.
God kreate mi before di world start. Na mi E first give life to.
Dem born mi before God make di sea or kreate wota.
Dem born mi before God make di mountins, even before E put di hills for where dem dey.
I dey before God kreate di eart, en fields or even di first san.
I dey der wen E put di sky for where e dey kon draw di boundary between eart and sea.
I still dey wen E put di kloud for sky; open di wota for di sea
kon orda sey make di wota wey dey di sea nor full pass as E kommand am. I dey der wen God lay di eart foundashon.
I dey near am like pesin wey dey design house before dem build am. Na mi dey make am happy evriday and I dey happy for en present.
I dey dance for di world wey E kreate kon dey happy with human being too.
So, make yong pipol listin to mi naw kon do wetin I tok and dem go dey happy.
Make una listin to wetin I dey tish una kon get sense. Make una nor rijet dem.
Make blessing follow di pesin wey dey listin to mi. Evriday, e dey wosh my gate and dey wait mi outside my house.
Doz wey find mi, go get life and God go favor dem.
But doz wey nor find mi, dey wound demsef and anybody wey hate mi, love to die.”Wisdom don build en house with seven pilas.
E don kill animals to take do party, mix spice for inside di wine kon put am for di tabol.
E send en savant go announce on-top di mountin for di town sey:
“Pipol wey nor know anytin, make una kom inside!” Den e tell doz wey foolish sey,
“Make una kom chop my food and drink di wine wey I mix.
Make una komot from where fools dey and una go get life. Make una kom follow wisdom waka.”
If yu korrect proud pipol, dem go curse yu! Anybody wey try to tok to wiked pipol, dem go still curse am.
So, nor ever korrect proud pipol, bikos dem go hate yu; but if yu korrect wise pesin, e go respet yu forever.
Anytin yu tell wise pesin go make am wise more-more. Anytin yu tell raitious pipol go give dem undastandin.
If yu won get wisdom, yu go first fear God. If yu know di One wey dey holy, den yu don get undastandin.
Wisdom go add more years to yor age.
Na yu go gain if yu get wisdom, so even if yu rijet am, na yu go still sofa am.
Foolishness bi like woman wey nor know anytin at-all, nor get shame at-all and wey dey tok anyhow.
Di woman go sidan for front of en house or for chair for di side wey high pass for di town
kon dey koll pipol wey dey waka pass; pipol wey dey mind dia own business sey,
“Pipol wey nor get sense, make una kom inside!” Den e go tell foolish pipol,
“Wota wey dem tif dey sweet well-well and bread wey dem tif chop, get betta taste.”
Doz wey fall for en trap nor know sey, anybody wey enter en house go die and doz wey don already enter don die since.Dis na di wise words wey Solomon tok: Shidren wey wise dey make dia papa proud, but fools dey kause pain for dia mama.
Propaty wey yu use wayo take get nor go do yu any good, but trut go save yu.
God nor go let honga kill good pipol and E nor go allow wiked pipol get wetin dem wont.
Lazines go make yu poor, but hard work go make yu get money well-well.
Pesin wey get sense dey plok en fruit for di rite time; but na disgrace for pesin to dey sleep for harvest time.
Blessing dey follow good pipol, but wiked pipol words dey put dem for trobol.
Pipol go remember good pesin bikos of di good tins wey e do, but dem go soon forget wiked pesin forever.
Pipol wey get sense dey happy well-well wen dem advise dem, but foolish pipol words go distroy dem.
Pipol wey dey tok trut dey save and sikure, but wayo pipol dey waka enter trobol.
Pesin wey dey hide di trut dey kause trobol, but pesin wey dey tok am for publik, dey work for peace.
Good pesin word dey give long life, but wiked pesin word dey put am for trobol.
Na only trobol bad belle dey kause, but love dey kover evry sin.
If pesin get sense, e dey show wen e dey tok, but if yu dey foolish, na stik dem go take beat yu.
Wise pipol dey kollect all di wisdom wey dem fit get, but wen yu hear foolish pipol dey tok, yu go know sey trobol nor dey far from dem.
Money dey protet rish pipol, but poverty dey distroy poor pipol.
Na life bi di reward to do good, but sin dey put pesin for more trobol.
Pipol wey dey listin if dem korrect dem go get long life, but doz wey nor dey gri sey dem dey wrong, dey waka lost.
Anybody wey pritend sey e like pesin, dey lie and anybody wey dey lie waka, na fool.
Too mush tok dey make pesin sin, but wise pesin nor dey tok anyhow.
Di words wey betta pesin tok bi like pure silva, but wiked pipol words dey yuzles.
Many pipol dey gain from word wey betta pesin tok, but stupid word fit kill pesin.
Wen God bless pesin, e dey get enough and nor-tin go make am regret.
Foolish pipol dey enjoy di bad tins wey dem dey do, but pipol wey get sense, dey happy to get wisdom.
Raitious pipol dey get wetin dem wont, but wetin wiked pipol dey get, na di tin wey dem fear pass.
Wen heavy breeze dey blow, e go blow wiked pipol trowey, but pipol wey dey tok trut, dey always dey save.
Nor allow lazy pesin work for yu, bikos e go bi like betta wine for yor mout or like smoke wey enter yor eye.
Obey God and yu go get long life; bikos wiked pipol dey die before dia time.
Di hope wey good pipol get, dey give dem joy, but wiked pipol, nor get wetin dem dey hope for.
God dey protet pipol wey dey tok trut, but doz wey dey do bad tins, na distroshon bi dia own.
Raitious pipol go always dey save, but wiked pipol nor go stay long for dis world.
Raitious pipol dey tok with sense, but anybody wey dey tok bad tins, go die.
If yu obey God, yu go always know di rite words to tok. But nobody go trust yu if yu always dey lie.God hate pipol wey dey play wayo, but E dey love doz wey dey do good tins.
E good to dey honest, but na disgrace go follow proud pipol.
Na trut dey guide yu if yu dey good; but pipol wey dem nor fit trust, na dia own wayo dey distroy dem.
Wen God won judge yu, yor money and propaty nor go fit help yu, but na to obey God bi di only tin wey go fit save yor life.
Pesin wey dey good dey always do good tins, but if yu dey do wiked tins, na yor own sin go distroy yu.
Raitiousness dey save doz wey dey tok trut, but doz wey dem nor fit trust, na dia own bad plans, dey kill dem.
Wen wiked pipol die, dia hope dey die with dem, bikos dem bilive on dia own pawa.
Pipol wey dey raitious, God dey protet dem from trobol; but trobol dey always follow wiked pipol.
Doz wey nor know God, wetin dem dey tok, fit distroy pesin, but di sense wey raitious pipol take dey tok, go save life.
Just as pipol dey happy wen good pesin dey prosper, na so too dem dey happy wen wiked pesin die.
E go betta for any town wey raitious pipol bless; but wiked pipol words go distroy am.
E too tok bad about odas, but if yu get sense, yu go fit kontrol yor mout.
Pesin wey dey judge anoda pesin, nor go fit keep sekret, but yu fit trust pesin wey dey tok trut.
Any nashon wey nor get who dey guide am, go fall, but wen doz wey dey give yu good advise many, yu go prosper.
Trobol dey follow who promise to pay di money wey strenja owe. So, e betta if yu nor put yorsef for di matter at-all.
Dem dey respet woman wey dey respet pipol, but even with all di propaty wey wiked men get, nobody dey respet dem.
Pesin wey good dey gain favor for ensef; but wiked pipol dey bring trobol for diasef.
Wiked pipol nor get gain for anytin, but reward dey for who dey do di korrect tin.
Anybody wey ready to live rite, go get life; but pesin wey sey na bad tins e like to dey do, go die.
God hate pipol wey get bad mind, but E love doz wey dey do di rite tin.
Make yu know sey God go ponish wiked pipol; but na betta judgement go follow raitious pipol.
Fine woman wey nor get sense, bi like ring wey dem put for pig nose and mout.
Wetin good pipol wont, dey bring good result; but evribody dey vex if wiked pesin get wetin e wont.
Wen pipol give out dia money, dem dey get more; but doz wey nor dey give, nor dey get at-all.
Make yu dey give and yu go prosper; help odas and yu go get help.
Pipol go curse di pesin wey store en korn dey wait who go buy am for high prize; but dem go praiz doz wey sell am for di normal prize.
Dem go respet yu if yu get good mind; but if yu dey look for trobol waka, na trobol go follow yu.
Doz wey trust dia propaty, go fall like wetin harmattan breeze blow; but raitious pipol go prosper well-well, dem go bi like sun wey dey shine.
Pesin wey bring trobol kom meet en family, nor go get anytin and foolish men go always bi savant to wise pipol.
Raitious pipol fruit bi like tree wey dey give life, but pesin wey dey prish give odas to turn kom meet God, get sense.
Doz wey good, dey get dia reward for dis world, but na ponishment go follow pipol wey dey sin and do wiked tins.Pesin wey dey happy wen dem korrect am, get wisdom, but anybody wey dey vex wen dem korrect am, nor get sense.
God dey happy with good pipol, but E dey kondemn doz wey dey plan wiked tins.
Wikedness nor dey pay pesin, but nor-tin dey shake good pipol.
Good wife dey bring joy and pride to en husband; but wife wey dey bring shame for en husband bi like diziz for en bone.
Good pipol dey always tink good, but make yu nor ever trust anytin wey wiked pipol tell yu.
Wiked pipol word dey kill, but raitious pipol word dey save pipol.
Wiked pipol dey die trowey, but doz wey dey fear God, dey get long life.
Dem dey praiz pesin wey get sense, but nobody dey respet wiked pesin.
E betta make yu bi ordinary pesin wey dey work to chop, dan to dey karry body up wen yu nor even get garri to soak.
Raitious pipol dey kare for dia animals, but wiked pipol dey trit dia own anyhow.
Pesin wey dey work hard, always get plenty to chop, but pesin wey dey porshu dis world tins, nor get sense.
Pipol wey bi tif dey jealous wetin odas tif, but wetin raitious pipol get, dey rish dem, bikos dem dey work for dia own food.
Wiked pipol words dey put dem for wahala, but raitious pipol go eskape from trobol.
Wise word get gain and hard work dey bring reward.
Foolish pipol dey always tink sey wetin dem dey do dey korrect, but wise pipol dey listin to odas.
Foolish pipol dey kwik vex, but wise men nor dey tok even wen dem curse dem.
Good witness dey tok trut, but wiked pipol dey always lie.
Foolish pipol dey tok anyhow, but wetin wise pipol tok, dey heal many wound.
Trut go last forever, but lie-lie nor dey tey before evribody go know sey na lie.

Yu go vomit all wetin yu don chop, den all di praiz wey yu praiz am, nor go mean anytin again.
Make yu nor try to tok sense give foolish pesin, bikos e nor go value am.
Make yu nor remove di old boundary stone wey yor grand-grand papa dem take mark land and pikin wey nor get papa and mama, make yu nor take en land.
Na God dey defend dem and E go judge dia kase against yu.
Make yu listin to yor tishas kon learn evritin wey yu fit learn.
Make yu always ponish shidren wen dem do wrong, bikos dat ponishment nor go kill dem,
but e go save dia life.

Make yu nor jealous sinnas, but make to dey fear God, bi di only tin wey koncern yu for dis life.
If e bi like dat, den yor future go dey sikure.

Nor make friend with pipol wey dey drink wine too mush or chop well-well,
bikos pipol wey dey drink and chop too mush, go soon luz evritin. So, If all wetin yu dey do na to dey chop and sleep, den yu go soon start to wear rag.

Make yu do anytin to get wisdom, trut, undastand and good sense and if yu get dem, make yu nor sell dem, bikos dem go help yu well-well.

Make yu do wetin go make yor papa and mama happy for yu, so dat yor mama nor go regret sey e born yu.
My pikin, listin well-well and make my life bi ezample to yu.
Ashawo and wimen wey dey bihave anyhow, na wiked trap dem bi.
Dem dey wait for yu like sey dem bi tif and dem don make many men sin against dia wifes.
Na who dem dey curse? Na who dey face trobol? Na who get enough? Na who dey komplain? Na who sore full en body? Na who nor dey fit si well?
Na doz wey dey struggol to drink wine and doz wey dey waka dey find new wine to drink.
So, make yu nor allow wine tempt yu, even doh e red well-well or dey shine for di cup and dey sweet for mout.
Bikos di next morning, e go bi like sey na snake wey get poizin, bite yu.
Yor eyes go si tins wey go sopraiz yu and yu nor go fit tink or tok well.
Yu go bi like pesin wey sleep near river or on-top boat for wota.
Yu go sey, “Dem attack mi, but I nor wound! Dem beat mi, but I nor remember. ‘Wen I go take stand up for bed, so dat I go-go find anoda drink?’ ”Make yu nor jealous evil pipol or try to make friend with dem,
bikos na only trobol dem dey always tink about and anytin wey dem tok, dey kause wahala.
Na wisdom pesin dey take build house, but na undastandin go make am stand
and na knowledge dem take dey dekorate am with fine and betta tins.
To dey wise, betta pass to dey strong! Yes, wisdom betta pass pawa.
So make sure sey yu plan well before yu go fight and di more dem advise yu well, di more yu go dey win.
Wise word too deep for foolish pipol to undastand. So wen ever pipol dey tok about sirious matter, foolish pipol nor get any betta tin to tok put.
If yu dey always plan evil, na trobol-maker dem go dey koll yu,
bikos anytin wey foolish pesin plan, dey make pesin sin and pipol nor like pesin wey dey laf odas.
If yu faint for di day wen wahala kom, dat one go show sey yor strent small well-well.
Kwik save doz wey dem won kill for wetin dem nor do.
If yu fit sey e nor koncern yu, God know and dey judge evritin wey yu dey do. E dey look yu and E know yu well-well. E go reward yu akordin to wetin yu do.

Make yu nor bi like wiked pipol wey dey plan to tif from good pipol or break enter dia house,

Make yu nor dey happy if yor enemies enter trobol and nor rijoice wen dem fall,
bikos God go know if yu dey happy and E nor go like am; den E fit nor kon ponish dem again.
Make yu nor fear doz wey dey do evil and make yu nor jealous wiked pipol at-all,
bikos wiked pesin nor get betta future and dem nor dey hope for anytin again.
So my pikin, make yu fear God and honor di king. Make yu nor do anytin with pipol wey dey tok against dem,
bikos God fit distroy dat kind pipol wons and who know di wahala wey God and di king fit kause for dem?
Wise pipol still tok dis tins too: E bad well-well if judge nor dey judge well for kourt.
If di judge sey na di pesin wey do wrong dey innocent, evribody go curse and hate am.
Judge wey dey ponish pesin wey do wrong, go prosper and get good name,
bikos, honest ansa na good sign for true friendship.
Before yu build yor house, make sure sey yu don prepare and ready yor farm for work.
Nor tok against anoda pesin without good rizin or tok yeye tins about pipol.
Nor boast sey, “I go do am back wetin e do mi. Yes! I go deal with am well-well.”
Wen I waka pass foolish and lazy pesin farm and vineyard,
na shuku-shuku and grass grow full am. Di wall wey dem build round am, don fall rish groun.
I look kon tink and I kon learn lesin from am sey:
Make yu sleep and rest as yu like or fold yor hand and rest small,
but make yu remember sey, as yu dey sleep, poverty go kom attack yu like tif.Dis na some of Solomon oda wise words and na King Hezekaya men for Judah kourt, rite dem down.
Na God get di pawa to hide tins, but na kings dey fit find and esplain dem to pipol.
Nobody fit know wetin kings dey tink. Just as sky high well-well and as sea deep rish, na so too dia mind bi.
Make yu remove dirty from silva, den yu go fit use am take make oda fine tins.
Nor let bad advisers near di king, so dat pipol go know am bikos e dey judge well.
Wen yu stand for king front, nor try to impress am or pritend sey yu bi betta pesin,

If yu and yor neighbour dey argue about sometin, e go good make una setol am between unasef and make yu nor tok about una sekret for publik.
If not, evribody go know sey yu nor fit keep sekret and yu nor go ever forget di shame wey go katch yu.
Bikos betta words wey dem tok well, bi like gold wey dem take dekorate silva.
Wen wise pesin advise pesin wey ready to listin, wetin e tok, betta pass fine gold ring or necklace.
As kold wota dey sweet for dry sizin, na so too savant wey pesin fit trust, dey make belle sweet di pesin wey send am.
Pipol wey dey promise and fail bi like kloud and heavy breeze wey nor dey bring rain.
Na patient and gentol tok, pesin dey take beg kings and na sweet mout dey setol sirious wahala.
Nor chop honey too mush bikos e sweet, so dat yu nor go vomit, bikos yu too chop am.
Make yu nor dey too visit yor neighbour, bikos dem fit taya kon hate yu.
To lie for pesin head bi like to kill pesin with swod, wound am with sharp arrow or shot am.
Like tit wey dey pain pesin or leg wey don break, na so too e bi to trust pesin wey nor dey sirious wen trobol kom.
To sing for pesin wey nor get peace for mind, bi like sey yu dey remove en klot from en body wen kold dey or rub salt put for en sore.
If yor enemy dey hongry, make yu gi-am food chop and if e dey thirsty, make yu gi-am wota drink,
bikos as yu do like dis, yu go make shame katch am and God go reward yu.
Just as heavy breeze from nort dey bring rain, na so too aproko dey make pesin vex well-well.
E betta make yu stay on-top house, dan to stay with wife wey dey komplain well-well.
To hear good news from land wey far, bi like wen pesin pour kold wota or drink for en body.
Wen good pesin listin to wetin bad pesin dey tok, e go bi like wota wey nor good or well wey get poizin.
Just as too mush honey nor good for yu, na so too, to make pipol dey praiz yu well-well, nor good.
If yu dey vex anyhow and nor fit kontrol yorsef, yu bi like town wey nor get fence at-all and wey dey eazy for enemy to attack.Just as pipol nor dey espect rain for dry sizin, na so too, respet nor good for foolish pesin.
Just as bird dey fly pass, na so too, curse wey dem put for yor head and yu nor deserve am, nor go do yu anytin.
E dey eazy to whip horse and kontrol donkey, but e nor eazy to kontrol foolish pesin.
If yu ansa yeye kweshon wey foolish pesin ask, den yu dey foolish, just like di pesin wey ask yu.
Make yu ansa fool akordin to en kweshon, so dat e go know sey e nor wise as e tink, but if yu nor ansa am, yusef go bi fool like am.
Just as if pesin kut en own leg komot, na so e bi too to send fool message, bikos na trobol di pesin dey look for.
As pesin wey en leg cripple nor fit use am, na so too foolish pipol words dey yuzles.
To praiz foolish pesin bi like to put stone for katapault kon ready to shot am.
Like shuku-shuku wey shuk drunkard man hand, na so too wise word bi for foolish pesin mout.
Like pesin wey dey shot en arrow anyhow, na so too e bi to pesin wey hire fool take work.
Just as dog dey go back go chop en vomit, na so fool dey always show en foolishness.
Pesin wey foolish well-well, betta pass pesin wey tink sey e wise, but e nor get sense.
Lazy pesin go sey, “Lion dey for outside! Many lion dey evriwhere for di street!”
Lazy pesin go just dey turn up-and-down for bed like door handle and
some pipol too lazy to even put food for dia own mout.
Lazy pesin go tink sey en wise pass seven pipol wey get sense well-well.
Pesin wey go argue matter wey nor koncern am, bi like wen yu dey waka for road kon go hold dog for en ear.
Just as e bad for mad pesin to play with bow and arrow,
na so too e bi with pesin wey deceive en neighbour and e sey, “Nor bi joke I dey joke?”
Fire nor dey katch without wood; so without aproko, kworel nor go dey.
Pipol wey like wahala dey kause trobol, just as mashes and kerosine dey start fire.
Aproko story dey sweet some pipol well-well, but to odas, e dey pain well-well go rish dia bones.
Pesin wey get wiked heart and dey lie well-well, bi like fine klot wey dem take kover klay pot, so dat pipol go tink sey na betta tin dey der.
Pesin wey hate odas and dey pritend sey e like dem, na wikedness full en heart.
Even doh e tok sweet words, make yu nor bilive am, bikos na wikedness full en belle.
E fit hide en wikedness, but evribody go soon si di bad tins wey e dey do.
So, anybody wey dig pit for pesin go fall inside my ensef and pesin wey roll stone to wound odas, na di stone go fall kill-am.
Na only pesin wey yu hate, yu go like lie against and yeye words dey distroy pipol.Make yu nor boast about tumoro, bikos yu nor know wetin go happen between naw and den.
So make yu let odas praiz yu, instead of yu to dey praiz yorsef.
Even doh san and stone dey heavy, e nor still heavy rish di wahala wey foolish pesin dey kause.
Vexnashon bad and anga dey distroy tins, but who fit stand and bear jealousy?
E betta make yu korrect pesin for open, dan to dey show am love for sekret.
If yor friend wound yu, e betta pass yor enemy kiss wey fit kill yu.
Wen pesin don beleful, even honey nor go sweet for en mout, but wen e dey hongry, even food wey bitter, dey sweet am well-well.
Anybody wey dey waka up-and-down, bi like bird wey nor dey stay en house.
Just as perfume and fine oil dey make pesin happy, na so too betta advise from pesin friend, dey bring joy to en heart.
Make yu nor forget yor friends or yor papa friends, bikos if yu dey trobol, yu nor nid to ask yor relashon for help. Di neighbour wey dey near yu, fit help yu pass yor relashon wey dey far.
My pikin, make yu dey wise and I go happy, so dat I go get good ansa to give anybody wey dey oppoz mi.
Wise pesin go si trobol dey kom kon run from am, but doz wey nor dey tink, go waka enter, den kon dey regret.
Pesin wey promise to pay money wey strenja dey owe, make una hold en propaty, especially if na ashawo e promise to pay for.
If yu shaut greet yor friend for morning, pipol go tink sey yu dey curse am.
Wife wey dey komplain well-well, bi like wota wey dey drop small-small for rainin sizin;
so how pesin go fit make am kwayet? Since pesin nor fit stop breeze or hold oil for hand, e nor go fit stop am too.
Just as iron dey make iron sharp, na so too, two pesin dey learn from each oda.
Make yu kare for yor fig tree and yu go get many fig fruit to chop and na like dis too, dem go honor savant wey dey kare for en masta.
Na yor own face dey shine for di wota wey yu dey look and na yor ownsef yu dey si for yor heart.
Just as grave nor dey taya to take dead body, na so too di tins wey pipol wont for dis world, nor dey satisfy dem.
Just as dem dey take fire test gold and silva, na so too dem dey test pesin good name.
Even if yu beat foolish pesin almost die, yu nor go fit beat en foolishness komot for en body.
Make yu kare for yor sheep and kattle as yu fit,
bikos money and propaty nor dey-dey forever. Even nashon nor dey last forever.
Wen grass die, new ones go appear and di plants for mountins go grow again,
den yor sheep hair go bi yor klot, yu go sell some goat wey dey yor field
and yu go get plenty goat milk to take feed yu, yor family and yor wimen savant.Wiked pesin dey run wen nobody dey porshu am, but honest pesin dey get heart like lion.
Wen pipol dey always sin, dia kountry go get many leaders, but pesin wey get sense and dey undastand tins well, dey bring peace.
Poor man wey dey opress oda poor pipol, bi like strong rain wey dey skata wetin pesin plant.
So pesin wey nor dey respet di law, dey praiz wiked pipol, but doz wey dey obey di law, nor like wikedness.
Evil pipol nor know wetin korrect judgement mean, but doz wey dey woship God, undastand am well-well.
E betta to dey poor and honest, dan to dey rish and dey do wayo.
Yong man wey dey obey di law get sense. Pesin wey dey make friends with yeye pipol na disgrace to en papa.
If yu get money from intrest wey yu dey kollect, bikos di pipol kon borrow from yu, one day, one pesin go kom kollect all yor propaty and e go sorry for poor pipol.
If yu nor dey obey di law, God nor go hear yor prayers.
If yu deceive honest pesin kon make am do bad tins, yu go fall enter di trap wey yu dig by yorsef, but God go reward innocent pipol well-well.
Rish pipol dey always tink sey dem wise, but poor pesin wey get betta karata, know di rite tin.
Wen good pipol dey rule, evribody dey happy, but wen bad pipol dey rule, evribody dey hide.
Yu nor go ever susid for life if yu try to hide yor sin. Konfess and stop to do dem and God go show yu mesi.
If yu always dey obey God, happiness go follow yu, but yu go distroy yor life if yu dey sturbon.
Just as pipol dey fear hongry lion and wiked bear, na so too poor pipol nor fit fight wiked ruler.
Ruler wey nor get betta sense, go rule with wikedness. But pesin wey nor like lie, go rule tey.
Pesin wey kill anoda pesin dey kwik-kwik dig en own grave, so make yu nor try to stop am.
Dey always tok trut and e go save yu, but if yu dey play wayo, na wons yu go fall.

Pesin wey dey tok trut, go live betta and happy life, but dem go ponish yu, if yu dey hurry to get money.
To dey judge anyhow nor good, but some judge dey lie for kourt, bikos of di small bribe wey dem won kollect.
Pesin wey get long-trot dey always hurry to get money, sotey e nor dey know wen poverty dey kom meet am.
If yu korrect pesin, e go like am pass wen yu praiz am.
Pesin wey tink sey e nor bad to tif from en papa and mama, nor betta pass ordinary tif.
To get long-trot dey only kause trobol, so e betta make yu trust God.
Pesin wey feel sey na only en know di korrect tin, na big fool, but pesin wey dey waka with wisdom, go dey save.
Make yu dey always give tins to poor pipol and yu nor go ever lack, but if yu nor dey sorry for poor pipol, dem go curse yu.
Pipol dey hide wen wiked pesin dey rule, but wen e nor dey again, raitious pipol go prosper.If yu nor dey gri take korreshon, one day yu go fall and yu nor go fit stand again.
Make yu show mi good ruler and I go show yu happy pipol. Make yu show mi wiked ruler and I go show yu pipol wey dey komplain.

Wen wise pesin take foolish pesin go kourt, di foolish pesin go only dey shaut and tok anyhow, but e nor go dey happy.
Pipol wey dey kill pipol nor like anybody wey dey tok trut, but good pipol go protet di pesin life.
Stupid pipol dey show dia vexnashon for publik, but pipol wey get sense, dey-dey patient and kontrol demsef.
If ruler dey listin to lie-lie word, den all en ofisas go dey plan wiked tins.
Just as God give eye to poor pesin, na so too E give eye to pesin wey dey opress oda pipol.
If king dey defend poor pipol, e go rule tey well-well.
To dey beat and korrect shidren, good well-well, bikos if dem dey do anytin wey dem like, dem go make shame katch dia mama.
Wen wiked pipol dey rule, many bad-bad tins dey inkrease, but good pipol go dey alive to si di way doz wiked pipol go take fall.

Pesin nor fit korrect en savant with just ordinary word, bikos even doh dem undastand am, dem nor go do wetin e tok.

“I dey foolish pass any oda man and I nor get sense like oda pipol.
I neva learn how to get wisdom and I nor know anytin about God.
Who don go heaven kom back? Who don ever katch breeze for en hand or wrap wota for klot? Who kreate di whole world? Na who e bi and na wetin bi en pikin name? Make yu tell mi, if yu know!
“Evritin wey God tok, dey korrect. E dey guide evribody wey kom meet am make E protet dem.
Make yu nor add join God word, if not, E go curse and koll yu lie-lie pesin.
“My God, I beg Yu for two tins and make Yu give dem to mi, before I die.
Di first one na: Help mi make I nor dey lie and deceive pipol and di sekond one na, make Yu nor make mi too rish or too poor! Make yu give mi di tins wey go rish mi use.
Bikos if I too get money, I fit deny Yu sey, ‘Who bi God?’ And if I too poor, I go fit go tif kon bring shame for yor holy name.
“Make yu nor ever spoil worker give en oga, bikos if di pesin curse yu, di curse go follow yu forever.
“Some pipol dey curse dia papa and some nor dey tank dia mama.
“Dem bilive sey dem dey good for dia own eye, but dem dirty pass rag.
“Dem dey karry body as dem dey waka, so dat pipol go dey look dem anyhow.
“Dia tit bi like swod and dia mout sharp like knife. Dem dey distroy poor pipol komot from dis eart and pipol wey nor get food to chop, dem dey kill dem trowey.
“Worm get two side wey dey sey: ‘Give mi, Give mi.’ “E get three tins wey nor dey beleful at-all and di fourt one nor dey ever sey: ‘E don do or e don rish.’ Dem bi:
“Grave, belle wey neva karry pikin, wildaness wey dry and fire wey dey burn well-well.

“E get four tins wey dey hard mi well-well to undastand and dem bi:
“ ‘How eagle take dey fly high-high for sky? How snake take dey waka for rock? How ship take dey move for river and how man take dey love woman?’
“Ashawo woman wey sleep with anoda man fit kill pesin, afta e go klean en mout kon sey, ‘Na wish bad tin I do?’
“E get four tins wey dey shake di eart and make pipol fear and dem bi:
“ ‘Savant wey turn to king; fool wey leta get money well-well;
woman wey pipol nor like wey kon marry and savant girl wey kon take en madam pozishon.’
“E get four tins for eart wey small, but dem wise well-well and dem bi:

“If yu don do foolish tins bikos yu dey proud or dey plan evil, make yu kover yor mout with shame.
Just as cream dey bring butter wen dem shake am and nose wey dem nak dey bring blood, na so too, to make pesin vex, dey kause wahala.”Na di words wey King Lemuel mama tish am, bi dis.
My pikin wey I born; my son wey I dedikate give God,
make yu nor waste yor strent dey follow wimen; bikos dem dey distroy kings.
Lemuel, my pikin! E nor good make king dey drink wine and make rulers too, nor dey take strong drink.
Bikos wen dem drink, dem fit forget di laws kon dey opress poor pipol.
Strong drink na for pipol wey dey won die and wine na for doz wey dia heart heavy.
So allow dem drink forget dia poverty and dem nor go remember dia trobol again.
Make yu tok for doz wey nor fit tok for demsef; make yu judge well for doz wey dem dey opress.
Yes! Tok well for doz wey dem dey opress and for poor pipol, den make sure sey dem give dem korrect judgement.
Who go fit find wife wey get good karata? Good wife betta pass gold.

E nor dey worry if kold dey, bikos en family get klot wey go make dem warm.
Na en dey make en own bed shit and e dey wear fine klot wey dem make with purpol linen.
Pipol know en husband well-well and dem dey respet am, bikos e dey sidan with di oda eldas, dey take decision.
E dey make klot and belt kon sell dem give tradas.
E dey strong; dem dey respet am and e nor dey fear wetin go happen for future.
E dey tok with betta sense and wisdom full en mout.
E always dey busy and e dey make sure sey evritin go well for en family.
En shidren value am and dem dey tank en and en husband. Dem dey always praiz am.
En husband go sey, “Many wimen na good wifes to dia husband, but yu betta pass all of dem.”
Gold dey deceive pipol and beauti dey disappear, but make pipol praiz woman wey dey honor and fear God.
Make una reward am for evritin wey e dey do and evribody must praiz am for di town.
