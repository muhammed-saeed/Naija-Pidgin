I bi one pesin wey know wetin e mean wen God ponish yu.
E don porshu mi and naw I dey waka for darkness.
Evritime, na only mi E dey always ponish.
E don make my skin and flesh old kon break di bones for my body.
Na sofa and wahala E pak full my life.
Even doh I neva die, E beri mi for darkness like pesin wey don die.
E don tie mi with shain like prisona wey nor get hope to eskape.
I kry well-well make E help mi, but God nor gri ansa mi.
E use big-big stones take block evriwhere wey I dey pass and I nor know di rite road again.
To mi, E hide like bear or lion wey dey wait to attack pesin.
E drag mi komot for road; tear mi to pieces kon leave mi and nobody dey to help mi.
E set en arrow to take shot mi die
and naw, E don shot mi and di arrow enter my heart.
I don turn pesin wey pipol dey laf and sing yeye song for.
Na bitterness and sofa bi di food and drink wey God dey give mi.
E don use my face rub groun kon break my tit with stone.
I nor know wetin peace mean again and I don forget as happiness dey bi.
Den I kry kon sey, “I nor get respet again! I don lost evritin wey I hope to get from God!”
Wen ever I remember as I take sofa without house to sleep, e dey pain mi like poizin for my belle.
I nor go ever forget di time wen I take sofa; wen I bin dey mourn, bikos of evritin wey I lost.
Anytime I remember all dis tins, I know sey I still get hope.
God faithful love nor dey end! And en mesi nor dey finish.
Wi dey always trust Yu bikos na evriday Yu dey show us yor goodness.
I tell mysef sey, “Na only God I get, so I go trust only en.”
God dey good to pipol wey trust and dey find am.
So e betta make wi sidan kwayet kon wait until God go kom save us.
And na naw wey wi still dey yong, wi suppose learn how to get patient as wi dey wait for God.
Make wi sidan kwayet wen God dey deal with us.
Make wi bow face groun, may bi na den God go give us hope again.
Pesin wey dem slap for one side, make e turn di oda side. Make e nor tok wen en enemies dey curse am.
Bikos God nor go forget us forever.
Even doh sey E dey make us sofa naw, E still dey sorry for us, bikos en great love for us nor dey end.
God nor like to sofa pipol or make dem kry.
So to dey opress pipol for dis world,
to shit pipol kon kollect wetin bi dia own, God wey dey heaven dey si evritin
and E know dey happy wen dem nor give pesin korrect judgement for kourt.
So, na who fit tok make sometin happen, if God nor allow am?
Nor bi from God mout evritin from kom? Both good and bad?
Den, why wi human being go dey komplain if dem ponish us for awa sins?
Instead, make wi shek and test di tins wey wi dey do kon turn from sin kom meet God.
Make wi lift awa hand and heart to God for heaven kon sey,
“Wi don sin and go against Yu and na dis make Yu dey vex for us.
Yu don hide yorsef bikos Yu dey vex and Yu porshu us komot for yor front. Yu nor even pity for us wen Yu dey kill us.
Yu hide yorsef for di kloud, so dat awa prayers nor go rish where Yu dey.
Yu don make us bi like dirty rag for all di oda nashons front.
All awa enemies dey tok bad against us.
Wi dey fear, bikos wi dey trap; wi don konfuse and distroy awasef.
Wota dey rush kom out from my eye, bikos dem don distroy my pipol finish.
I still dey kry well-well and I nor go stop at-all
until God go look from heaven kon si wetin don happen.
My heart heavy well-well wen I si wetin happen to di wimen for dis town.
Pipol wey I nor do bad to, set trap for mi like sey I bi bird.
Dem trow mi inside one pit kon dey drop stone for my head.
Dem dey pour wota put for my head and I tink sey na die I dey.
But from inside di deep pit, I kon koll Yu wey bi my Oga God.
Yu hear my kry for help wen I sey: ‘God make Yu listin to mi well-well!’
Yes! Wen I koll Yu, Yu kom tell mi sey, ‘Nor fear.’
Oga God, na Yu bi my lawyer, so make Yu judge my kase, bikos Yu don save my life.
Yu don si di bad-bad tins wey dem do mi. So my God, make Yu judge my kase, so dat pipol go know sey I dey rite.
Yu don si all dia plans to revensh mi.
Yu don hear all di wiked names wey dem dey koll mi and Yu know all di plans wey dem don make.
Evriday, my enemies dey tok as dem dey plan against mi.
Si dem! Weda dem sidan or stand, na mi dem dey laf and take dey sing.
So Oga God, make Yu pay dem back for all di bad tins wey dem don do.
Make Yu give dem sturbon and strong heart, so dat yor curse go dey dia head.
So as Yu dey vex, make Yu porshu and distroy dem komot dis world.”
