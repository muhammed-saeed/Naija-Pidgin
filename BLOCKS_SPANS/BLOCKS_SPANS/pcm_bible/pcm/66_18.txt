Afta all dis tins, I still si anoda angel wey get betta authority, dey kom down from heaven and di way e brite rish, kon make di eart dey shine.
E shaut with loud vois sey: “E don fall! E don fall! Babilon wey big well-well don fall! E don bikom di place where demons, evil spirits, bird and animal wey pipol hate, dey stay.
Bikos en sin bi like drink wey dey shark pesin and na-im make dem dey sleep with who dem nor marry. Na dis make am fall and all di kings for dis eart don sleep with am and many tradas don get plenty money, bikos of di yeye life wey e dey live.”
Den I hear anoda vois from heaven sey, “My pipol, make una kom out from am, so dat una nor go follow am kommit sin kon sofa di same ponishment.
Bikos en sins don high rish heaven and God go remember dem.
Make yu pay am as e take pay odas; pay am doubol for wetin e do. For di wine cup wey e mix, make yu mix doubol for am.
As e karry ensef up, dey enjoy yeye life, na so di sofa and sadnes wey yu go gi-am, go plenty rish, bikos e tok for en mind sey, ‘I dey rule like kween, my husband neva die and I nor go ever si sadnes again!’
Bikos of dis, na one day God go ponish am for all en sin with diziz, mourning, honga and dem go burn am with fire, bikos na Oga God wey go judge am, get all di pawa!”
Den di kings for dis world wey follow am kommit sin and enjoy yeye life, go kry kon shaut for am wen dem si di smoke from di fire wey dey burn am.
Bikos di kings nor one join am sofa, dem go stand far dey sey, “E bad well-well! Babilon, di big town wey get pawa! E bad well-well for yu! Na for only one hour God take distroy yu finish!”
Den doz wey dey sell tins go kry and mourn for am, bikos nobody go buy dia tins again.
Tins like gold, silva, stone wey dear, beads, fine linen, purpol klot, silk material, red klot and difren tins wey dem take wood wey dear, bronze, iron and marbol make.
Cinnamon, spices, incense, pomade wey dey send well, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flower wey dem take dey make bread, melu, sheep, shariot, slaves and human being soul.
(Di ripe fruit wey dey hongry yu well-well to enjoy and di tins wey dey sweet yu, don leave yu and yu nor go ever si dem again!)
Doz wey dey sell and get money from am, go stand far, bikos dem nor one join am sofa and dem go kry and mourn for am.
Dem go sey, “E bad well-well! Babilon, di big town wey wear fine linen, purpol and red klot, plus gold, stone wey dear and beads! E bad well-well for yu!
Bikos na only one hour God take distroy dis big town finish!” And evry ship, dia kaptain and pasenja, plus evribody wey dey work for sea, go stand far,
bigin shaut wen dem si di smoke from di fire wey dey burn di town kon dey sey, “Who get pawa rish dis big town, Babilon?”
Den dem go pak dust for dia head kon dey kry and mourn: “E bad well-well! Babilon, di big town and where all doz wey get ship for sea dey from get money, bikos na only one hour God take distroy am! E bad well-well for yu!
Evribody wey dey heaven, God pipol, di apostles and profets, make una happy bikos God don judge and kondemn am bikos of una!”
Den one angel wey get pawa, pick one big stone, trow am inside sea kon sey: “Na so dem go take trowey Babilon di big town with force enter sea!
So, di pipol wey dey play harp, sing music, blow flute and trumpet, dem nor go ever hear dia sound from yu again. Doz wey get handwork and business pipol, dem nor go ever si dem inside yu again. Pipol wey dey grind tins, dem nor go ever hear dia nois inside yu again.
Even lantan lite nor go ever shine inside yu again! Dem nor go ever hear sey man and woman dey marry inside yu again. Na yor tradas get pawa pass for dis world, bikos yu take yor majik deceive all di oda kountries!
God pipol, di profets and doz wey yu kill for dis world, God don si dia blood inside yu.”
