My darlin, yu too fine! I nor fit diskribe as yu fine rish. Even with di lite klot wey yu take kover face, yor eyes still dey shine like dove own. Yor hair dey dance like woman goat wey dey kom from Mount Gilead.
Yor tit dey white like sheep wey dem just barber en hair kon wosh en body klean. Yor tit komplete and all of dem mash each oda.
Yor lips bi like red klot; yor mout sweet well-well. Yor fore head for di lite klot wey yu take kover, bi like pomegranate fruit.
Yor neck fine well-well like David towa and e round and smooth and yu wear necklace wey get 1,000 tins wey dey guide am.
Yor two breast bi like gazelle or deer wey bi twins wey dey chop for where lily flower dey.
Before di morning breeze go blow and darkness go disappear, I go hurry go myrrh mountin and incense hill.
My love, yu too fine and dey pafet!
My wife to bi, make yu follow mi from Lebanon. Make yu kom down from Mount Amanah, from Senir and Hermon and where lion and leopard dey stay.

My sista and wife to bi, yor love dey sweet mi for body. Yor love betta pass wine and yor perfume scent pass spices.
My wife to bi, yor lip sweet like honey, bikos honey and milk dey under yor tongue. Yor klot dey scent like cedar for Lebanon.
