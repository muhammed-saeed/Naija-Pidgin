For di first year wen Zazes pikin, Darius wey bi Media king, dey rule Babilon.
For dat same year wen e dey rule, mi Daniel kom undastand di holy book wey sey na seventy years God tell Profet Jeremaya sey, Jerusalem pipol go skata for di world.
So I wear sak klot, sidan for ashes den turn to God kon dey beg am as I dey pray and fast.
I pray to God kon konfess all di bad tins wey wi don do sey: “God! Yu get pawa well-well and wi dey honor Yu. Yu dey keep yor promise and Yu love pipol wey love and dey obey Yu.
Wi don sin! Wi wiked well-well and wi dey do bad tins. Wi nor dey do wetin Yu kommand and wi don turn from yor korrect way.
Wi nor gri listin to yor savants wey bi profets; di ones wey tell awa kings, rulers, grand-grand papa and all di nashon about Yu.
“Awa God! Na only Yu dey do wetin dey rite, but dem dey disgrace us evriday, bikos Judah, Jerusalem and all di pipol wey Yu skata go evriwhere, nor gri listin to Yu.
My God! Wi dey sofa like dis, bikos awa king, rulers and grand-grand papa, don sin against Yu.
But even with all di sin wey wi kommit, Yu still dey forgive and sorry for us.
Wi nor dey obey di Oga awa God, bikos wi nor dey live awa life as E sey make wi leave am. Wi even bilive sey di law wey E sey make en savants tell us, nor mean anytin.
“All of us don break yor law and wi nor gri listin to wetin Yu tok. Wi don sin and na awa sins make Yu dey ponish us so, just as yor savant, Moses rite am for di law.
Yu don do wetin Yu sey Yu go do wi and awa leaders. For all di towns wey dey for dis world, na Jerusalem Yu dey ponish pass.
Yu dey ponish us just as dem rite am for Moses Law. But as Yu ponish us rish, wi still dey kommit sin and wi nor gri do wetin Yu tok.
Awa Oga God dey ready to ponish us and E really ponish us, bikos anytin wey E dey do, dey rite, yet wi nor gri listin to am.
“Naw, awa God, na Yu take yor pipol komot from Egypt with yor mighty pawa kon make name for yorsef wey dem nor fit forget forever. Wi don sin and wi dey bihave like wiked pipol.
Before-before, Yu dey defend us. So make Yu nor vex for Jerusalem again, bikos na yor town and holy hill, e bi. Doz wey dey stay near us, dey look Jerusalem kon dey laf yor pipol, bikos of awa sin and di wiked tins wey awa grand-grand papa dem do.
“So naw, God, make Yu hear my prayer and as I dey beg Yu. Make Yu sorry for yor temple wey dem don distroy; so dat evribody go know sey na only Yu bi di God wey nor dey die.
Abeg, God make Yu sorry for Jerusalem town wey Yu choose, nor bi bikos wi deserve am, but bikos of yor great love wey nor dey fail.
So make Yu forgive us! Make Yu kwik hear and ansa us. Nor bi just for yor town and en pipol, but na to make pipol honor and praiz yor holy name.”
As I still dey pray, dey konfess and beg God make E forgive mi and Israel pipol sin kon sorry for en holy temple,
Angel Gabriel wey I don first si for my vishon before kon dey fly kom where I dey. Dat time, dem won offa di evening sakrifice.
Di angel tell mi, “Daniel, I don kom make yu really undastand naw.
God don ansa yor prayer since di very first day wen yu start to pray and beg am and na di love wey E get for yu, make mi kom so. Naw, make yu listin well-well as I dey tok kon undastand di vishon:
“God don set seventy weeks as di time wen E go take free yor pipol kon ribuild en temple. Una dey sofa, bikos of all di evil and wiked tins wey una do. Afta, E go forgive una sins and judge una well forever, so dat wetin E tok, go happen. Den E go anoint di holy temple again.
“So make yu know and undastand sey, ‘From naw wen I tell yu dis message, till di time wen dem go ribuild Jerusalem and di leader wey God choose go kom, e go bi seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. Dem go build di town well again, but wahala go dey for dat time.
“ ‘Afta di sixty-two weeks, di Pesin wey God choose, go die and nor-tin go remain. Di ruler wey get pawa pass, go bring sojas kom distroy di town and di temple. Di end go rush kom like wota; e go bring war and distroshon, just as God plan am.
“ ‘Dat ruler go enter agriment with many pipol for one week, den for di middle of dat week, e go stop all di sakrifice and ofrin. Den e go start one bad tin wey go kause wahala and tins go bi like dat, until di time wey God sey E won distroy di wayo pesin wey kause di wahala.’ ”
