Job still sey:
“As long as God Almighty wey nor gri judge my kase kon make my life bitter dey alive,
as far I dey breath and God still give mi life,
my mout nor go ever tok bad and my tongue nor go ever tok lie-lie words.
I nor go ever agri with wetin una dey tok! I go stand for my rite till I die.
I nor go ever give up, bikos I dey rite; my mind dey klean and my konscience nor dey judge mi.
“Make all my enemies, sofa like wiked pipol and doz wey nor know God.
Doz wey nor know God before dem die, na wish kind hope dem get?
Wen trobol go kom, God go hear dia kry?
God go show dem en happiness? Dem go fit koll God anytime wey dem like?
Make I tish yu how God pawa strong rish. Make I tell yu about di Almighty God plan.
But I nor go tish yu, bikos yu don si am by yorsef. So wetin make yu dey tok all dis bad tins?”
Zofar ansa, “Na so God take dey ponish pipol wey dey like trobol and do wiked tins.
If dia shidren many, dem go die for war and di ones wey remain nor go si food chop beleful.
Di ones wey manage survive, na sickness go still kill dem and dia wife nor go kry for dem.
Wiked pipol fit get plenty money like san, dia klot fit plenty pass evribody own,
but na good pipol go wear dia klot kon kollect dia money.
Wiked pipol dey build house like spider own or like where hunta dey stay.
E go sleep as rish man, but wen e wake-up, e nor go si en money again.
Just as wota dey karry tins go, na so too fear go karry dem go and for nite, breeze go blow dem trowey.
Strong wind from east go swip dem komot from dia house
and as dem dey try to run, God nor go sorry for dem and E go blow dem fall.
Strong breeze go push dem as dem dey run and with en pawa, e go porshu dem komot from where dem dey.”
