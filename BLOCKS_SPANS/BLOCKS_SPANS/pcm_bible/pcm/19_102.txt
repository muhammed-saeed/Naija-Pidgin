David Song
My God, I go sing about yor love and how Yu dey judge! I go praiz Yu with difren song.
Make Yu help mi to do di rite tin, so dat I go dey honest and dey do good as I dey rule my kingdom.
I nor go even tink to do bad tin and I nor go join pipol do bad tins.
I nor go follow bad pesin make friend; I nor go tink of evil at-all.
I go distroy anybody wey dey plan bad for en neighbour and I nor go sorry for who dey deceive pipol or doz wey get pride.
I go favor di good pipol wey dey di land and dem go kom stay with mi. Na only doz wey nobody dey tok bad about, go serve mi.
I nor go allow pipol wey dey deceive odas, serve for my house and doz wey dey lie, nor go stay for my present.
Evriday, I go distroy wiked pipol for di land and doz wey dey do evil, I go drive dem komot from God town.
