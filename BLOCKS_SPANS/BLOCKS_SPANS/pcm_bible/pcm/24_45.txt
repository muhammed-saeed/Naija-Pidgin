For di fourt year wey Josaya pikin, Jehoiakim bi king for Judah, Baruk wey bi Neraya pikin, rite evritin wey I tell am. So I sey,
“Dis na wetin Israel God dey tell Baruk:
Yu sey, ‘I don taya and I nor get hope again! God don add join all my wahala and naw, my body dey pain mi and I nor get rest!’ ”
But God tell mi Jeremaya, “Make yu go tell Baruk sey, ‘I go soon skata wetin I build kon rut wetin I plant. I go do like dis for evriwhere for di world.
Yu dey find betta tins for yorsef? Make yu nor worry yorsef, bikos I won bring wahala kom dis world. But anywhere wey yu won go, I go let yu go and I go save yu.’ ”
