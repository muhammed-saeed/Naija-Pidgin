One day, e koll Profet Natan kon sey, “I dey stay dis house wey dem build with cedar, but God Kovenant Box, dey for tent!”

But dat nite, God kon tell Profet Natan,
“Make yu go tell David wey bi my savant sey, ‘Nor bi yu go build temple for mi wey I go stay.
From di time wey I save Israel pipol from Egypt till naw, I neva stay for temple; na only tent I dey stay and I dey waka from one place to anoda.
As I dey follow Israel pipol travel rish, I neva tell any leader wey I choose before sey make e use cedar build temple for mi.’
So make yu tell David wey bi my savant sey, di Oga God sey, ‘I take yu komot from where yu dey kare for animal kon make yu rule Israel wey bi my pipol.
I dey follow yu go anywhere wey yu dey go and I dey make yu win all yor enemies as yu dey fight. I go make evribody know yu for evriwhere, just as dem know all di big leaders for di world.
I don choose place for my pipol Israel and I don put dem for where dem go stay and nobody go opress dem again.
Bad pipol dey opress dem since dem kom dis land, but e nor go happen again. I promise sey, I go make yu win all yor enemies and I go give yu many shidren.
Wen yu die and yu don go join yor grand-grand papa, I go make one among yor shidren king and I go make en kingdom strong.
Na-im go build temple for mi and I go make sure sey en kingdom go dey forever.
I go bi en papa and e go bi my pikin. Wen e do wrong, I go ponish am as papa dey ponish pikin.
I nor go take my love and favor from am just as I take am from Saul, wey I remove so dat David go bi king.
En house and kingdom go dey before mi forever; en family go rule forever.’ ”
Profet Natan tell David evritin wey God show am.
Den David enter Tabanako sidan kon bigin pray sey, “My Oga God! Mi and my family nor rish who Yu go do all dis good tins for.
But Yu dey even do di ones wey pass dem. Yu don promise my shidren-shidren tins for many years wey dey kom and Yu, Oga God don let mi si dis tins.
Wetin I go tell Yu again? Yu know mi well-well, but Yu still dey respet mi wey bi yor savant.
Bikos of yor promise and as Yu wont am, na-im Yu take do dis tins kon show mi wey bi yor savant.

No kountry for dis world bi like Israel wey Yu komot from slave kon make dem yor pipol. Di big tins wey Yu do for dem, make pipol know yor name for di whole world. Yu save yor pipol from Egypt, plus di juju and gods wey dey der.
