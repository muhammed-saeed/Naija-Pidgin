David Rite Song Give Jedutun, Di Kwayamasta
I tell mysef sey, “I go dey kareful for wetin I dey do and I nor go sin with wetin I dey tok. I go hold my tongue wen sinnas dey near mi.”
But even as I dey kwayet and nor tok wetin good or bad, my sorrow and pain still dey worse more-more.
Di more I dey tink about am, di more e dey pain mi for my heart; so I kon sey:
“My God, na how long I go dey dis life? Wen I go take die? Make Yu tell mi wen my life go end.
Si! Yu don make my life short well-well and my whole life bi like one sekond to Yu. True-true, evribody life just bi like breeze wey dey blow pass.”
Wi bi like shadow wey dey waka pass and evritin wey wi dey busy dey work for, nor mean anytin. Wi dey gada money keep and wi nor know who go spend am.
So, my God, where I won put my hope? Na Yu bi my only hope.
Make Yu save mi from my sins. Make Yu nor let fools laf mi.
I kwayet for yor present; I nor go tok anytin, bikos of wetin Yu don do.
But abeg, make Yu nor flog mi again! I don taya for di beat wey Yu dey beat mi.
Wen Yu ponish us for awa sins, Yu dey remove awa pawa like rat wey dey chop pesin food. But each of us, na just breeze wey dey blow pass.
My God, make Yu hear my prayers! Make Yu listin to my kry for help! Make Yu dey look di tears from my eye. I bi like pesin wey travel kom stay with Yu, just as my grand-grand papa dem bi to Yu.
Make Yu take yor vexnashon from mi, so dat I go fit smile again before I die.
