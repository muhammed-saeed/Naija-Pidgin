David Song
My God wey dey heaven, na Yu I dey depend on.
Just as savants dey depend on dia masta and as savant girls dey depend on dia madam, na so wi too dey depend on di Oga awa God, until E go favor us.
My Oga God, make Yu sorry and pity for us, bikos wi too don get awa own share for di trobol.
Di wahala wey wi get, don taya us and awa trobol, plenty well-well.
