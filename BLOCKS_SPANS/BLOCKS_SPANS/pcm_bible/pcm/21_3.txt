Evritin wey dey happen for dis world, dey happen for di rite time wey God wont make e happen.
Time dey to born and time dey to die; time dey to plant sometin and time dey to harvest wetin yu plant.
Time dey to kill and time dey to heal pesin; time dey to skata and time dey to build.
Time dey to kry and time dey to laf; time dey to mourn and time dey to dance.
Time dey to skata stones and time dey to gada dem again; time dey to embrace pesin and time dey not to embrace pesin.
Time dey to find sometin and time dey to stop to find; time dey to keep sometin and time dey to trowey tins.
Time dey to tear klot and time dey to sew; time dey to just dey kwayet and time dey to tok.
Time dey to love pesin and time dey to hate pesin too; time dey to fight war and time dey to make peace.
So, wetin pipol really dey gain for all di hard work wey dem do?
I don si di heavy work wey God give us en pipol, so dat wi go dey busy.
God dey make evritin happen for di rite time. Yet nobody go fit really undastand all di tins wey E don do and E put kweshons for awa mind about wetin don happen before and wetin go still happen.
So I gri sey, e nor get anytin wey betta rish to dey happy and enjoy yorsef as far as yu dey alive.
So, make pipol chop, drink and enjoy wetin dem work for, bikos all dis tins na God gift.
Bikos I know sey anytin wey God do, na final and e go dey forever; dem nor go fit add anytin join am or remove anytin from inside. God make evritin like dis, so dat pipol go fear am.
Wetin dey happen naw, don happen before and wetin go happen for future don still happen before, bikos God dey make di same tin happen again and again.
I still si sey, for dis world, yu go si wikedness for where good judgement and rite pipol suppose dey.
Den I tell mysef, “E nor go tey before God go judge evribody, bikos of evritin wey dem don do! Both good and bad pipol.”
I still sey, “God dey do all dis tins bikos of us, so dat wi go know sey wi nor betta pass animals.”
Na di same tin go happen to pipol and animal; di two of dem must die. So pipol nor betta pass animal. Dis tin dey yuzles too.
Di two of dem dey waka go di same place and bikos God kreate dem with san, wen dem die, dem go turn to san again.
Who go fit show sey, wen pesin die, en spirit dey go up, but wen animal die, na groun en spirit dey go?
So I si sey, di best tin to do as human being, na to enjoy wetin wi don work for. Dat na di rizin why wi dey here, bikos nobody go fit bring us kom enjoy life again afta wi don die.
