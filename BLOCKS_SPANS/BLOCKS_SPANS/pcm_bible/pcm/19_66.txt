David Song For Di Kwayamasta
My God wey dey Zion, na betta praiz dey wait Yu, bikos yor pipol dey do wetin dem promise.
Bikos Yu hear and ansa awa prayers; so evribody go kom meet Yu.
Awa sins too many, so Yu don forget us, bikos wi nor dey hear word.
But blessing go follow di pesin wey Yu choose to stay yor palis. Make di good tins wey dey yor house, yor holy place, beleful us.
Yu really ansa awa prayers wen Yu show us how Yu take dey save and diliver us. Di whole eart trust Yu; plus pipol wey dey di oda side for di sea.
Yu kreate di mountins with yor strent kon show as yor pawa strong rish.
Yu make di rof sea kwayet kon silent di nashons wey dey kause trobol.
Even pipol wey dey far from awa land, dey sopraiz for yor greatness and Yu make doz wey dey stay for east and west, praiz Yu.
Yu visit di eart kon make rain fall put, so dat e go dey good kon produce plenty food. Yu make wota full di sea and di land dey bring betta food, bikos Yu don kommand sey na so e go bi.
Yu dey wet di dry groun with rain, so dat di soil go soft and seeds go grow well.
Yu crown di year with yor good blessing and even where hard pass, still dey produce plenty food.
Di grass for wildaness dey fresh and di hill dey shine with joy.
Na animals full di fields and na betta food full di valley. Evritin dey sing and shaut for joy!
