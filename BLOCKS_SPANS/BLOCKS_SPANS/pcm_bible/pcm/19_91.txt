Moses Prayer
My Oga God, from generashon to generashon na Yu dey protet us!
Yu bi God wey nor dey die! Even before Yu kreate di mountins and di whole world, Yu don dey.
Yu make human being go back to san where Yu from kreate dem wen Yu sey, “Make una go back to where I for kreate una!”
To Yu, one tazon years bi like one day or like some hours for nite.
Yu dey swip pipol trowey like dream wey dey vanish. Dem bi like grass wey grow for morning.
For morning, dem dey grow and shine, but for evening, dem go dry kon die.
Yes, yor vexnashon dey kill us and Yu dey make us fear as Yu dey vex.
Yu know all di sins wey wi kommit; even di sins wey wi hide do, Yu dey si all of dem.
Yes! As wi dey alive, wi dey si as Yu dey vex and awa years dey kwik-kwik end.
Na seventy years Yu give us! Some pipol even dey rish eight years. Even di estra years wey human being dey live, na pain and trobol full am; but di years go soon disappear and wi go fly go.
So na who go fit know as Yu dey vex rish? Yor vexnashon strong well-well and e dey make us fear Yu.
So make Yu tish us, so dat wi go know sey wi bi ordinary human being, den awa wisdom go dey grow more-more.
My God, make Yu kom back to us! Na how long wi go dey sofa like dis? Make Yu kom sorry for yor savants!
Make Yu satisfy us evry morning with yor love wey nor dey fail, so dat till wi die, wi go always dey sing with joy.
Make Yu replace awa former sofa with happiness and awa bad years with good tins!
Make Yu let wi yor savants si yor works again kon allow awa shidren si yor glory.
Make di Oga awa God show us en favor, den evritin wey wi dey do, go prosper. Yes! Make Yu allow evritin wey wi dey do, prosper!
