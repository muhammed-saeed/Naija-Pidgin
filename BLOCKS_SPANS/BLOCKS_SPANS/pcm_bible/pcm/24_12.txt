My God, Yu dey always trit mi well anytime wey I komplain give Yu. But I ask Yu one kweshon about good judgement: “Why e bi sey wiked pipol dey prosper and pipol wey nor dey honest, dey susid?
Na Yu plant dem like tree kon make dia rut strong for groun and dem dey grow and bear betta fruit. Dem dey always tok about Yu even doh dem nor kare about Yu.
But my God, Yu know mi! Yu dey si evritin wey I dey do and how I love Yu rish. Make Yu take dis wiked pipol komot like sheep wey dem won go kill. Tell us wen dem go die.
Na how long awa land and di grass for di farm go dey dry? Awa animals and birds dey die, bikos of dis pipol wikedness! Pipol wey sey, ‘God nor dey si wetin wi dey do.’ ”
Den God ansa, “Jeremaya, if yu don taya to follow dis pipol run, how yu won take follow horse run? If yu nor fit stand for open land, how yu won take stay for forest near Jordan?
Even yor own brodas and family dey against yu; dem don join doz wey won kill yu. Make yu nor trust dem, even doh dem dey trit yu well.”
God still sey, “I don forget Israel pipol and rijet di nashon wey I choose. Doz wey I love, I don give dem to dia enemies.
Pipol wey I koll my own don turn against mi like lion for forest; di way dem dey tok to mi, bi like wen lion dey shaut. So I go trit dem like sey I hate dem.
My pipol attack mi like birds or hyenas and oda wiked birds dey with dem. So make all di nashons gada like wiked animals kon distroy dis pipol wey I koll my own.
Naw, strenjas go distroy my vineyard; skata my farm kon turn di land wey I love to where nobody dey stay.
Dem don turn am to wildaness. Di land empty and dey yuzles to mi. Di whole land don turn desert and e nor koncern anybody.
Pipol don tif all di tins wey dey di land. I send sojas go distroy di land and nobody for der go get peace.
My pipol go plant korn, but na grass dem go gada. Even doh dem work hard, nor-tin go show sey dem work, bikos I dey vex for dem, so dia food wey dem plant, nor go grow.”
God sey, “I still get sometin wey I won tok about di wiked nashons wey surround Israel; di nashon wey distroy di land wey I give my pipol. I go rut dem from dia kountry like tree wey dem rut komot for groun, den I go save Judah pipol.
Afta I don take dem komot dia land, I go sorry for dem kon bring each nashon kom back to en own land again.
But dem must first asept my pipol relijon with dia heart and as dem make my pipol swear with dia Baal juju, na so too, dem go use my name take swear kon sey: ‘Wi swear with God wey nor dey die.’ If dem do all dis tins, I go add dem join my pipol.
But I go rut and distroy any of doz nashons wey nor gri obey mi.” Mi, wey bi God, don tok.
