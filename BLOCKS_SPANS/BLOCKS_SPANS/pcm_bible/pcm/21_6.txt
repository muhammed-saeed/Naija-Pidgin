E get anoda sirious tin wey I don still si for dis world and e dey show for pipol life.
God dey give some pipol many propaty, honor and evritin wey dem wont, but E nor dey give dem di shance to enjoy dem. Dem go die, den anoda pesin go help dem enjoy dia propaty! Dis one dey yuzles and bad well-well.
If pesin get hundred shidren and e stay for dis life kon old, but if e nor get happiness and dem nor do betta beri for am, den I go sey, “Pikin wey dem just born and e die, betta pass am.”
E for betta sey dem nor born dat pikin, bikos en life disappear enter darkness. E nor even get name.
E nor ever si day lite or know wetin life bi, but at least, e get rest
pass di man wey stay 2,000 years for dis world and e nor ever enjoy am. Afta all, di two of dem dey go di same place.
Pipol dey work just bikos of wetin dem go chop, but dem still nor dey beleful.
So, how wise pipol take betta pass pipol wey bi fool? Poor pesin wey sabi work well-well, wetin e go gain for dis life?
So, make yu enjoy wetin yu get, instead of wetin yu wont and stop to dream of tins wey dey yuzles, like pesin wey dey porshu breeze.
Evritin wey dey happen, na wetin God don sey go happen and all of us know sey, yu nor go fit argue with pesin wey strong pass yu.
Bikos di more pesin dey argue, di more en word nor dey mean anytin, so how dat one go take benefit anybody?
Who know wetin good for pesin for dis yuzles and short life wey wi dey live? Life wey bi like shadow, how wi won take know wetin go happen for di world afta wi don die?
