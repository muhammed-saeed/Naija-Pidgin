My soul, make Yu praiz God! My Oga God, si as Yu dey great! Yor glory dey shine well-well kon kover evriwhere.
Yor dress dey shine like lite and Yu stresh di sky like curtain for heaven;
Yu build yor palis kon put am on-top di kloud where rain from dey kom. Yu turn di kloud to yor shariot kon dey ride am on-top di wind.
Breeze na yor messenja and fire na yor savant.
Yu build di world on-top strong foundashon, so dat nobody go fit remove am.
Yu kover di eart with wota and di wota kover di mountins.
Wen Yu kommand, wota dey vanish and wen Yu shaut, e dey bi like tonda and di wota dey kwik-kwik rush komot.
Mountins dey raiz-up and valley dey sink go di place wey Yu choose for dem.
Na Yu set where di sea go flow rish, so dat dem nor go ever kover di eart again.
Yu turn springs to rivers and dem even dey flow between mountins.
Dem dey provide wota for all di animals wey dey di field; even wiked donkey sef dey si wota drink.
Birds dey build house near di rivers and dey sing from tree for bush.
From God house for heaven, E dey send rain kom wota di mountins, so dat di seed for di eart go grow.
Yu dey make grass grow for animals to chop kon provide plant for human being to use. Yu allow us produce food from di eart;
wine wey go make us happy; olive oil wey go make awa skin good and bread wey go give us strent.
God send rain give en tree make dem for dey grow well; di cedars for Lebanon wey E plant.
Di birds dey make dia house for der and di stork bird dey stay for di trees wey always dey green.
Wiked goat dey stay di high mountin; animals for rock dey-dey save inside dia whole.
God make di moon to mark di mont and di sun dey shine just as God program am.
God dey bring darkness and nite kom and na dat time, wiked animals for di forest, dey waka.
Even lions dey kry bikos of honga and dem dey ask God for dia food,
but wen sun don dey kom out, dem go-go back to dia house go sleep.
Den men go-go do dia work and dem go work till evening.
So my God, make Yu si all di difren tins wey Yu don do! Na sense Yu take make all of dem. Na wetin Yu kreate full di whole eart.
Di sea dey der, both wide and small ones wey get difren tins wey Yu kreate and both small and big fish, dey inside.
Di ship dey travel on-top sea and Yu still make whale dey swim and play for der too.
All wetin Yu kreate dey wait for Yu to give dem food wey dem go always dey chop.
Yu give dem food and dem kollect am; Yu open yor hand to feed dem and dem chop beleful.
Wen Yu nor ansa dem, dem go dey fear. Wen Yu remove life from dem, dem go die kon turn to san.
Na yor breath wey dey give life, Yu take kreate dem kon make dem plenty for dis eart.
God glory go always dey forever! Make God always dey happy for di living tins wey E kreate!
E look di eart and di eart shake; E tosh di mountin and dem start to bring smoke.
So I go sing to God as long as I dey; I go sing praiz to my God as long as I dey breath!
Make wetin I dey tink, make belle sweet am and I go rijoice bikos of my God.
So, make sinnas vanish komot from di eart and make wiked pipol disappear! Make my soul praiz God! Make wi praiz awa Oga God.
