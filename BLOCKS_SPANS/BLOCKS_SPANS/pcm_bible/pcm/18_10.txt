“Life don taya mi; so make Yu hear as I dey tok how my heart betta rish.
I go tell God sey, ‘Before Yu kondemn mi, first tell mi wetin I do wey make Yu dey vex.’
E good as Yu dey opress mi? Yu dey opress wetin Yu make with yor hand. Yu dey happy for wetin wiked pipol dey do?
“Yu dey si tins di wey wi dey si dem? Abi Yu get di kind eye wey human being get?
Yor life short like awa own? Abi yor years know long life awa own.
Den wetin make Yu dey look for my sins and evry mistake wey I make?
Even doh Yu know sey I nor dey guilty, e nor get who fit save mi from yor hand.
“Na di same hand wey Yu take make mi, Yu won take skata mi?
Make Yu remember sey na san Yu take make mi; so Yu won turn mi to dat san again?
Na yor pawa my papa take born mi; na Yu make mi grow for my mama belle.
Yu make my body with bone kon kover am with flesh and skin.
Yu don give mi life kon show mi yor love wey nor dey die. Na bikos yu kare for mi naim make mi still dey alive.
But na naw I know sey for all dat time, Yu dey plan to wound and kill mi.
Yu dey look to si weda I go sin, so dat Yu nor go forgive mi.
If I sin, na big wahala Yu dey give mi, but if I do betta tin, Yu nor go gri reward mi. I don taya, na shame and trobol kover mi so.
If I sey make I karry body up, Yu go porshu mi like lion and na mi Yu go use take show yor pawa.
Yu must get pipol wey go tok against mi; yor vexnashon dey big evriday by day and na new attack Yu always dey plan for mi.
“God! Why Yu let my mama born mi? I for don die, before anybody si mi.
To die for my mama belle, for betta pass dis one wey I dey so.
Abi my life neva finish? Make Yu leave mi with my own! Abeg, make I enjoy di small life wey I still get.
I go soon go di land where Yu nor go fit si mi and I nor go kom back again.
I go-go di dark place where dead pipol and konfushon dey. Place where lite nor dey-dey.”
