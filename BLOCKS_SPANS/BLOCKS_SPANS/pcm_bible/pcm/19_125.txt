David Song
Make Israel pipol sey, “If to sey Oga God nor dey awa side?”
If to sey God nor really dey awa side wen pipol attack us,
dem for don swallow us alive as dem dey vex.
River for don kover us; wota for don karry us go.
Strong wave for river for don kover awa soul.
So, make wi praiz God wey nor let awa enemies tear us to pieces with dia tit!
Wi don eskape like bird wey komot from hunta trap. Dia trap and net wey dem set for us, don break and wi don dey free!
God wey kreate heaven and eart, na-im diliver us from dia hand.
