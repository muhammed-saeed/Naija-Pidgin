And I go send one angel go before una rish der kon drive Kanaan, Amor, Hit, Periz, Hiv and Jebus pipol komot der.
Una dey go di land where milk and honey full. But I nor go dey with una, bikos una bi sturbon pipol and if I travel with una, I fit go distroy una for road.”
Wen di pipol hear dis word, dem kon start to mourn and dem nor gri wear ear-ring or gold again.
God tell Moses, “Make yu tell Israel pipol sey, ‘Una too sturbon. So, if I go with una, I fit vex distroy una. Naw make una remove all una gold and fine klot, even doh I still dey tink wetin I go do with una.’ ”
So from di time wey Israel pipol komot from Mount Horeb, dem nor ever wear gold or ear-ring again.
