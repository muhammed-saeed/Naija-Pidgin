David Song For Di Kwayamasta
I wait with patient make God kon help mi, and E turn kon hear my kry.
E take mi komot from di pit where shame, pain and sofa full kon put my leg for groun wey strong well-well, den E make mi strong as I dey waka.
E don give mi new song to sing and hymns wey I go take praiz awa Oga God. Many pipol go si wetin E do kon praiz am, den dem go start to trust God.
Make una si as pipol wey trust God dey happy; doz wey nor like proud pipol or woship juju.
My Oga God, Yu don do wonderful tins for us. Wetin Yu plan for us too many to kount. Nobody bi like Yu. If I start to kount all di wonderful tins wey Yu don do, I nor go fit kount dem finish.
Yu really don make mi undastand sey, nor bi only sakrifice and ofrin yu wont. True-true, Yu nor just wont only burnt or sin ofrin.
Den I sey, “Look, I don kom, just as dem rite about mi for yor Book sey:
‘My God, I won do wetin Yu wont, bikos Yu rite yor laws for my heart.’ ”
I don tell yor pipol about how Yu dey judge. I nor dey fear to tok about all di good tins wey Yu don do.
All di good tins wey Yu do, I nor keep dem for my heart; but I don tok about as Yu dey faithful and yor pawa wey dey save pipol.
So Oga God, make Yu nor stop to dey sorry for mi. Make yor love and faith wey nor dey fail, always dey protet mi.
Trobol gada round mi and I nor fit kount dem! My sins don many well-well and I nor sure sey I go fit dey free from dem! Dem many pass di hair wey dey my head and I don lost all my hope.
So my God, abeg, make Yu save mi! Make Yu kwik-kwik kom help mi.
Make shame and disgrace follow di pipol wey dey try to distroy mi. Pipol wey dey happy bikos I dey sofa, make disgrace follow dem.
Make shame and disgrace follow dem, bikos dem sey, “Yes o-o! Wi don get am naw!”
But pipol wey dey find Yu, make joy and gladness full dia heart. Make doz wey love yor salvashon always dey shaut sey, “God dey great!”
I dey poor and I nor get anytin, so make God keep mi for en mind. My God, make Yu kwik kom, bikos na Yu bi my help and di Pesin wey go save mi.
