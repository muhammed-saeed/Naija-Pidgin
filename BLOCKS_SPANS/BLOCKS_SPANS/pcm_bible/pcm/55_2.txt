So yu, my pikin, make yu dey strong for di grace wey Christ dey give.
Di tins wey yu hear mi tok for pipol present, make yu tish oda pipol wey yu trust sey dem dey ready to tish odas.
Make yu dey ready to sofa as mi and odas dey sofa, so dat yu go bi good soja for Christ.
Nor-tin koncern sojas with tins wey ordinary pipol dey do; if not, e nor go do wetin en oga wont.
Bikos anybody wey dey run race, nor go fit win unless e follow di rule wey dey di game.
Farmer wey work well-well, naim suppose get di first share for di harvest.
Make yu tink about wetin I dey tok so and Christ go help yu to undastand evritin.
Remember Jesus Christ wey kom from David family; di pesin wey God raiz from deat; bikos na so e bi for di message wey I dey prish
and na dis Good News make mi dey sofa, sotey dem kon put mi for prison like tif; but dem nor fit put God word for prison!
So I dey ready to bear di sofa, as long as e go save doz wey God don choose inside Christ with glory wey go dey forever and ever.
Dis word na true: If wi die with am, wi go live with am too.
If wi bear with am, den wi go reign with am too and if wi sey wi nor know am, en too go sey, e nor know us.
Weda wi get faith for am or not, Christ go still bi who e bi and e nor go shange.
Make yu remind evribody about dis tins, den make yu kommand dem for God present sey, make dem nor dey argue about words, bikos doz kind tins nor dey good and e fit konfuse doz wey dey listin.
Make yu do evritin wey yu fit do, so dat God go si yu as betta pesin. Dey do yor work well as pesin wey nor dey shame, but dey ready to esplain God word wey bi trut.
Make yu nor put mout for yeye tok, bikos pipol wey dey do doz tins, dey far from God.
Dia word dey spread like diziz and na dis tin happen to Hymenaeus and Filetus.
Dem leave di trut kon dey sey resureshon don happen already and like dis, dem don make some pipol fall from di faith.
But God strong foundashon still stand and dem rite put sey, “God know en pipol and evribody wey bi Christ own, must stop to do evil.”
Wen yu go rish man house, nor bi only gold and silva tins dey der, but tins wey dem use wood and klay take make still dey der too and some dey make di house fine and odas nor good at-all.
So if yu keep yorsef without fault, yu go bi betta pesin wey Christ fit use as e dey do en good work.
Make yu run from doz tins wey dey hongry yong pipol to do, so dat yu go please God forever. Den yu go fit love and stay for peace with odas wey dey serve God with klean heart.
I dey tell yu again sey, make yu nor put mout for yeye word, bikos yu know sey dis kind tin dey kause kworel.
Pesin wey bi Christ savant nor dey kworel, instead e must dey good with evribody; must sabi tish well-well and get patient with sturbon pipol.
E must dey gentol as e dey korrect pipol wey dey oppoz en prishin and God fit let dis pipol turn from sin kom meet am, so dat dem go know di trut.
Den dia sense go korrect and dem nor go fall enter devil trap again. Bikos devil don katch dem put inside en trap before, so dem dey do anytin wey e wont.
