God sey, “Man pikin, make yu take one stone kon put am for yor front den draw Jerusalem put.
Tie am well-well! Make wall round am, den guide am with sojas and betta iron gate.
Make yu take one iron pan kon set am up like wall between yu and di town. Den turn make yu face Jerusalem to show sey dem nor go fit eskape wen dia enemies dey kom distroy dem. Dis go bi warnin to Israel pipol.
“Den, sleep with yor left side kon put Israel sins on-top yor body. And for di days wey yu take sleep with yor left side, Israel pipol sin go dey yor head.
Na mi know di nomba of days wey yu go bear dia sins rish and na three hundred and ninty days wey go ripresent di years wey dem don sin.
“Wen yu don komplete dis days, yu go sleep again, but dis time, yu go sleep with di rite and Judah sins go dey yor head. I don sey dis one go bi forty days. One day go ripresent one year.
Yu go turn face where yu tie di iron pan put kon tok against am sey;
Look! I go tie yu with rope, so dat yu nor go turn anyhow until di days don komplete.
“Naw, take some bread, beans, lentil, millet and korn kon put dem for one kontaina, den make yu chop from dem. Na di same days wey yu take sleep, yu go take chop and na three hundred and ninty days.
Evriday, di food wey yu go chop must nor heavy pass half pound and make e bi for di same time wey use choose.
And na one and half lita of wota yu go dey drink evriday.
Yu go use dry human being shit take make fire where yu go take bake di bread wey yu go dey chop evriday and na for where evribody go for si yu.”
God still sey, “Dis na to show how Israel pipol go chop food wey dia law sey make dem nor chop. Dat time, I go don skata dem go difren place.”
But I ansa, “God wey get pawa well-well, make Yu nor do am like dat! Since I small, I neva chop food wey di law dey forbid or chop animal wey die on en own or wey wiked animal kill. I neva chop any food wey nor klean.”
So God sey, “Okay! I go allow yu use melu shit, instead of human being own.”
God still sey, “Man pikin, I go remove bread from Jerusalem. Di pipol go dey measure di food and wota wey dem dey drink, so dat e nor go finish.
Dia bread and wota go finish; dem go dey for pain and dem go die finish, bikos of dia sin.”
