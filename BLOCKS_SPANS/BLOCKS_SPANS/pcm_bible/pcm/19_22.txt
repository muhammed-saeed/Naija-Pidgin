For Di Kwayamasta: David Song
My God, si as di king dey rijoice, bikos of yor pawa! E dey happy and shaut, bikos Yu make am win.
Yu don gi-am evritin where e wont and na evritin wey e ask for, Yu gi-am.
Na suksess and progress Yu take welkom am back kon put one fine gold crown for en head.
Wen e sey make Yu save en life, Yu do evritin wey e ask for and en family go rule forever.
Yor viktory dey gi-am betta honor. Viktory with majesty wey make evribody know am for evritin.
Yor blessing bi like klot for en body and Yu gi-am joy for yor present.
Bikos di king trust God, en love wey nor dey fail, nor go let di king fall.
Di king go katch all en enemies. E go seize evribody wey hate am with en strong rite hand.
Wen Yu appear, Yu go trow dem put for fire wey dey burn well-well. God go vex distroy dem for di fire.
Yu go distroy dia shidren-shidren from dis world and dem nor go ever get shidren again.
Aldo dem plan against Yu, dia wiked plan nor go work.
Dem go turn and run from Yu, bikos of yor arrow wey Yu shot.
My God, make Yu raiz-up with all yor pawa and wi go praiz and sing songs to take celebrate evritin wey Yu don do.
