Make yu nor jealous evil pipol or try to make friend with dem,
bikos na only trobol dem dey always tink about and anytin wey dem tok, dey kause wahala.
Na wisdom pesin dey take build house, but na undastandin go make am stand
and na knowledge dem take dey dekorate am with fine and betta tins.
To dey wise, betta pass to dey strong! Yes, wisdom betta pass pawa.
So make sure sey yu plan well before yu go fight and di more dem advise yu well, di more yu go dey win.
Wise word too deep for foolish pipol to undastand. So wen ever pipol dey tok about sirious matter, foolish pipol nor get any betta tin to tok put.
If yu dey always plan evil, na trobol-maker dem go dey koll yu,
bikos anytin wey foolish pesin plan, dey make pesin sin and pipol nor like pesin wey dey laf odas.
If yu faint for di day wen wahala kom, dat one go show sey yor strent small well-well.
Kwik save doz wey dem won kill for wetin dem nor do.
If yu fit sey e nor koncern yu, God know and dey judge evritin wey yu dey do. E dey look yu and E know yu well-well. E go reward yu akordin to wetin yu do.
My pikin, make yu chop honey bikos e good. Just as honey sweet for yor mout,
na so wisdom dey good for di soul. Make yu get wisdom and yor future go dey sikure.
Make yu nor bi like wiked pipol wey dey plan to tif from good pipol or break enter dia house,
bikos no matter how many times good pipol fall; dem dey always get up again; but trobol dey distroy wiked pipol.
Make yu nor dey happy if yor enemies enter trobol and nor rijoice wen dem fall,
bikos God go know if yu dey happy and E nor go like am; den E fit nor kon ponish dem again.
Make yu nor fear doz wey dey do evil and make yu nor jealous wiked pipol at-all,
bikos wiked pesin nor get betta future and dem nor dey hope for anytin again.
So my pikin, make yu fear God and honor di king. Make yu nor do anytin with pipol wey dey tok against dem,
bikos God fit distroy dat kind pipol wons and who know di wahala wey God and di king fit kause for dem?
Wise pipol still tok dis tins too: E bad well-well if judge nor dey judge well for kourt.
If di judge sey na di pesin wey do wrong dey innocent, evribody go curse and hate am.
Judge wey dey ponish pesin wey do wrong, go prosper and get good name,
bikos, honest ansa na good sign for true friendship.
Before yu build yor house, make sure sey yu don prepare and ready yor farm for work.
Nor tok against anoda pesin without good rizin or tok yeye tins about pipol.
Nor boast sey, “I go do am back wetin e do mi. Yes! I go deal with am well-well.”
Wen I waka pass foolish and lazy pesin farm and vineyard,
na shuku-shuku and grass grow full am. Di wall wey dem build round am, don fall rish groun.
I look kon tink and I kon learn lesin from am sey:
Make yu sleep and rest as yu like or fold yor hand and rest small,
but make yu remember sey, as yu dey sleep, poverty go kom attack yu like tif.
