Wen Paul rish der, di Jew pipol wey kom from Jerusalem kon stand round am, dey akuiz am sey e kommit sin wey dem nor fit show.

Bikos Festus one make di Jew pipol happy, e kon ask Paul, “Yu ready to go Jerusalem make I judge yor kase for der?”

Wen I dey Jerusalem, di priest oga dem and di eldas kon tell mi about am sey make I kill-am.
But I ansa dem, ‘Rome law nor gri make dem kondemn anybody wen e neva face and defend ensef before pipol wey dey akuiz am.’
So afta dem follow mi kom here, I kon pospone di kase, but di next day I sidan for judgement seat kon orda make dem bring di man kom.
Wen pipol wey dey akuiz am stand up, dem nor tok any bad tin against am as I bin suspet.
Instead, dem dey argue matter with am, about how dem dey serve God and one man wey dem dey koll Jesus Christ wey don die, wey Paul sey e still dey alive.
Bikos I nor know how I go take judge di matter, I kon ask am weda e go like go Jerusalem make dem judge am der.
But Paul sey make dem take am go Rome, so dat Caesar go judge en kase, so I kon orda sey make dem keep am for prison, until I go fit send am go meet Caesar.”

But I kon si sey e nor do anytin wey go make dem kill-am and wen e sey e won make di emperor judge en kase, I kon gri sey I go send am go meet Caesar.
But I nor know wetin I go rite go give di emperor about am. So naim make mi bring am kom all of una and king Agrippa front, so dat afta una don kweshon am finish, I go get sometin wey I go fit rite.
Bikos for my mind, e nor dey rite to send prisona go kourt, wen yu nor rite wetin e do.”
