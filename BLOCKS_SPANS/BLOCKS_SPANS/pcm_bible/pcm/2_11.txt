God kon tell Moses, “I go bring di last wahala to take ponish Fero and Egypt pipol and afta dis one, e go free una. E go drive una komot with evritin wey una get.
So make yu go tell Israel pipol make dem ask dia neighbour for silva and gold.”
(Naw, God don make Egypt pipol love Israel pipol. Even sef Moses kon bi one very big pesin for Egypt and Fero savants and Egypt pipol dey respet am.)
Moses sey, “Oga God sey for mid-nite, I go waka pass evriwhere inside Egypt
and all di first-born son for Egypt, go die. I go start from Fero first-born wey go take-ova en papa throne, go rish di first-born wey en slave girls wey dey grind korn born and all di first-born among en animals.
Strong kry go dey evriwhere for Egypt; pipol neva kry like dat before and dem nor go ever kry like dat again.
But for Israel pipol side, peace go dey well-well, even dog nor go bark for anybody or animal, den yu go know sey Oga God don separate Israel pipol from Egypt pipol.
All dis yor savants go kom meet and bow for mi sey, ‘Make yu and all di pipol wey dey follow yu komot for here’ and afta dis, I go komot for here too.” With vexnashon, Moses kon waka leave Fero.
God kon tell Moses, “Fero nor go gri listin to yu, so dat I go fit do my plenty wonders for Egypt.”
So Moses and Aaron do all dis wonders wey Fero si, but God make Fero heart strong, so dat e nor go let Israel pipol komot from Egypt.
