David Song For Di Kwaya Leader. E rite am wen Doeg from Edom go meet and tell Saul sey David don go Ahimelek house.
Yu wey tink sey yu strong, why yu dey karry body for di bad tins wey yu dey do? Yu nor know sey God love dey always protet mi?
Evriday, na how yu go take distroy pipol yu dey plan. Yor tongue dey kut pipol like razor blade and yu sabi lie well-well.
Yu like bad tins pass good ones and yu love lie-lie pass trut.
Yu wey dey lie well-well, yu like to distroy odas with yor words!
But God go distroy yu wons and for all. E go remove yu from yor house kon distroy yu from dis world.
Doz wey dey do wetin dey rite, go si am kon happy. Dem go laf dey sey,
“Si wetin happen to dis man wey nor trust God and tink sey e strong. E trust en money kon dey happy for di wiked tins wey e dey do.”
But I bi like olive tree wey dey grow well inside God house. I go always trust God love wey nor dey fail.
My God, I go praiz yu forever, bikos of di tins wey yu don do. I go always dey trust Yu, bikos pipol wey dey obey Yu, know sey Yu dey good.
