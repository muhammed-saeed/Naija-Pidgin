David Song
Di OGA tell my Oga God, “Make Yu sidan for where honor dey for my rite hand, until I don put all yor enemies under yor leg.”
God go make yor kingdom big and strong for Jerusalem and yu go rule ova yor enemies.
Wen yu go war, yor pipol go dey happy to follow yu go fight. Na holy garment dem wear for yor body and yor pawa go dey fresh evriday like morning dew.
God don promise and E nor go break di vow wen E make sey: “Yu bi priest forever like Melkizedek.”
Di Oga God stand for yor rite hand to protet Yu and E go kill many kings, wons E don dey vex.
E go ponish di nashons and dead body go full dia land. Yes! E go kut pipol head full di whole world.
But di king go drink from di wota wey dey flow pass for di road kon rule forever.
