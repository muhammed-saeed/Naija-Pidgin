Afta dem don do all dis tins finish, some among Israel leaders kom meet and tell mi, Di pipol, di priest and Levi pipol neva separate demsef from di pipol wey dey di kountries wey near dem. Dem still dey do tins with Ammon, Moab, Egypt, Kanaan, Hit, Periz, Jebus and Amor pipol. Dem dey do di same yeye tins wey doz pipol dey do.
Jew men dey marry wimen wey bi strenjas, so dem don dirty God pipol wey dey holy and na di leaders and ofisas dey do dis tins pass.
Wen I hear dis tins, I vex tear my klot, kut my hair and bear-bear kon sidan for groun dey mourn.
Den all di pipol wey dey respet and fear God word kon sidan with mi too bikos of di bad tin wey di pipol do. I sidan der kon dey mourn until wen dem won do di evening sakrifice.
Wen di time don rish for di evening sakrifice, I get up from where I sidan, but I still wear my tear-tear klot kon knee down, stresh my hand to di Oga my God kon pray.
I sey, My Oga God, I dey shame to raiz my head for yor front. Awa sins high pass awa head; dem even high rish heaven.
From awa grand-grand papa time kon rish naw, wi wey bi yor pipol don sin well-well. Na bikos of awa sin, wi, awa kings and priests, fall for strenj kings hand and dem kill, tif and karry us go as prisonas. Dem don disgrace us well-well as wi dey today.
“But naw, for dis short time, awa Oga God, Yu don trit us well kon stop some of us to bi slave and wi dey live for peace for dis Holy Place. Yu don remove us from slave work kon give us new life.
Even doh wi bi slave before, Yu nor leave us as slave. Yu make Persia king favor us kon allow us go ribuild yor temple wey skata and make wi wey dey Judah and Jerusalem get peace.
But naw, awa God, wetin wi fit tok afta evritin wey don happen? Wi don disobey di kommand
wey Yu give us thru yor savants di profet. Dem tell us sey di land wey wi go stay nor dey klean, bikos di pipol wey dey stay der, dey do many-many dirty tins.
Dem tell us sey if wi won stay der for peace and leave am for awa shidren-shidren forever, make wi nor marry doz pipol or help dem prosper.
Even afta di ponishment wey don happen to us bikos of awa sin, wi still know sey Yu, awa God, dey sorry for us, bikos even doh Yu dey ponish us, Yu still help us survive am.
So, how wi go forget yor kommand again kon go marry doz wiked pipol? If wi do am, Yu go vex kon distroy us finish and nobody go survive.
Awa Oga wey bi Israel God, Yu dey good. Wi, yor savants wey remain, kom meet Yu and wi dey konfess awa sins. Aldo wi nor get any rite to kom yor present again afta evritin wey wi don do.”
