Oga God, na Yu bi my God! I go praiz yor name kon show as Yu good rish, bikos Yu don do wonderful tins and na as Yu tok before-before, na so Yu do am.
Yu don turn di towns to where dem dey trow dirty put. Di place where strenjas for dey save before, nor bi town again and nobody go ribuild am.
Pipol from strong kountry go praiz Yu and wiked pipol from oda towns, go fear Yu well-well,
bikos na Yu dey protet poor pipol and doz wey nor get anytin. Yu dey protet dem from rain kon kover dem from hot sun, bikos di way wiked pipol dey bihave, bi like heavy rain wey dey fall.
Just as heat dey make land dry, na so too Yu dey kwayet strenjas wey dey karry body up. Just as kloud shadow dey make hot place kool, na so too Yu dey silent wiked pipol.
For Mount Zion, God wey dey lead heaven sojas go do big party for all di pipol for di world. For di party, plenty food go dey to chop and wine go dey to drink; betta meat and sweet wine go dey too.
Na for dis mountin God go for swallow sorrow, pain and evry bad tin wey dey trobol en pipol.
God wey get pawa go distroy and swallow deat forever! Doz wey dey kry, God go klean dia eyes and E go remove di disgrace wey en pipol don sofa for dis world. God, wey dey lead heaven sojas, don tok.
Wen all dis tins dey happen, pipol go sey, “Look! Make una si God for here! Wi wait for am and E don kom diliver us. Si God for here! Wi really wait for am. So make wi rijoice and dey happy bikos E don save us.”
God go protet and guide Mount Zion, just as pipol dey mash grass pass, na so too E go take distroy Moab pipol.
Even wen dem stresh dia hand like man wey won swim, God go ponish dem and dia hands go weak, bikos of dia pride.
God go distroy di high wall wey Moab pipol take dey protet diasef and E go bring dem down forever.
