My pikin, make yu listin to my wisdom and put yor ear down for di words wey I dey tish yu.
Den yu go know how to bihave well and di way yu go dey tok, go show sey yu get wisdom.
Anoda man wife lip fit sweet like honey and en kiss dey smooth like oil,
but wen evritin don finish, yu nor go gain anytin inside escept pain and bitterness.
Di woman go take yu go where dead body dey, bikos dat road dey lead to deat.
Di woman nor dey tink about di road wey dey save; e dey waka lost but e nor know.
But my pikin, make yu listin to mi and nor forget wetin I dey tok.
Run from dat kind woman; nor even go near en door.
If yu follow am, nobody go respet yu again and strenjas go take evritin wey yu get.
Yes! Strenjas go take all yor propaty and anoda pesin go kollect evritin wey yu work for.
Den for di end, yu go kry with pains kon die go like dat.
Den yu go sey, “Why I nor follow wetin dem tish mi? Why I nor let dem korrect mi?
Why I nor obey my tishas! Why I nor do wetin dem tok?
Naw, na wons dem disgrace mi for publik.”
Just as yu go take wota from yor own well, na so too make yu dey faithful and love only yor wife.
Make yu nor just bi like river wey anybody fit drink from.
Make yu keep yorsef for yor wife alone and know bi for strenjas.
So always dey happy with yor wife and find joy for di woman wey yu marry from di biginnin,
bikos e fine and dey honbol like deer. Make en smile dey make yu happy and make en love satisfy yu.
My pikin, why yu go-go give yor love to anoda woman? Wetin make yu like di way anoda man wife bi?
God dey si evritin wey yu dey do and E know evriwhere wey yu dey go.
Wiked man sins na trap, bikos na en own sin net, go katch.
E go die bikos e nor fit kontrol ensef. Na en yeye life go send am go en grave.
