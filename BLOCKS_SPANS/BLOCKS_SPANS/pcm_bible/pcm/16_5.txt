Afta sometaim, many among Israel pipol, both men and wimen kon dey komplain about dia own brodas.
Some sey, “Wi get big family, so wi nid enough food wey wi go dey chop, so dat wi nor go die.”
Odas sey, “Wi don use awa farm, vineyard and house take-take loan, so dat wi go get enough food to chop, make honga nor kill us.”
Some odas still sey, “Wi borrow money take pay di royal tax for awa farm and vineyards.
Wi bi Jew pipol too, awa shidren bi like dia own shidren. But wi sell awa shidren as slave give dem. Dem don sell some among awa dotas as slave. Wi nor get pawa or who go help us, bikos dem don take awa farms and vineyards from us.”
I vex well-well wen I hear dia kry and komplain.
Afta I tink about am well-well, I kon tok against di ofisas and doz wey get money. I tell dem, “Una dey opress and ponish una own brodas as una dey take intrest wen dem borrow money from una!” Bikos of dem, I kon koll evribody togeda make dem tok for di matter.
I kon sey, “Just as wi fit, wi don dey buy awa Jew brodas wey sell demsef give strenjas back. But naw, una by unasef won sell una own brodas! So how many times wey go buy dem back?” But di leaders kwayet and nor fit defend diasef.
Den I sey, “Wetin una dey do so nor good! Una nid to respet God and dey do wetin korrect. Den una nor go give awa enemies wey bi Gentile pipol, any shance to laf us.
Even mi, my brodas and men dey borrow money and korn give di pipol, but naw, make wi stop dis intrest wey wi dey take from dem.
Make una kancel all di debt wey dem dey owe una; weda na money, korn, wine or olive oil kon give dem back dia vineyards, farms, olive farm and house!”
Di ofisas and doz wey get money kon ansa, “Wi go do as yu tok. Wi go give dem dia propaty and nor kollect wetin dem dey owe us.” Den I koll di priests kon make di ofisas and doz wey get money swear for dia front, so dat dem go keep di promise wey dem just make.
I pul di garment wey I wear kon shake am. Den I sey, “Na so God go take shake any of una wey nor keep en promise. E go distroy una house and evritin wey una get and nor-tin go remain for una.” Evribody wey dey der kon sey, “Amen!” Den dem kon praiz God. And di ofisas and doz wey get money, do wetin dem promise.
Na di twenteth year wey Atazazes bi king, e make mi govnor for Judah and since den kon rish naw wey bi di twelft year wey I dey rule Judah (di thirty-two years wey Atazazes don dey rule), mi and my family nor chop di food wey dem suppose dey give mi as govnor.
All di govnors wey don rule before mi, trobol di pipol and dey kollect forty silva koins evriday for food and wine. Even dia savants dey opress di pipol too. But I difren from dem, bikos I dey fear God.
I use all my pawa and money take ribuild di wall and I nor buy any propaty for mysef. Evribody wey dey work for mi, join ribuild di town too.
I dey always feed 150 Jew pipol and dia leaders for my house; apart from di strenjas wey dey kom meet mi from di tribes wey surround us.
I dey kill one melu, six big sheep and many fawol evriday and evry ten days, I dey provide fresh wine. I nor take di tins wey I suppose take from di pipol as dia govnor, bikos of di heavy work wey dem dey do.
So my Oga God, I abeg, make Yu remember evritin wey I don do for dis pipol, den make Yu bless mi.
