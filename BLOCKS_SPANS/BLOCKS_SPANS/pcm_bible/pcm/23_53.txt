“Na who go bilive di message wey wi dey hear naw? Na who don si God hand for dis matter before?
My savant grow like seed wey dem plant for dry groun. E nor even get beauti or respet wey go make us notis am.
Pipol rijet am and dem nor like am at-all. E bear sofa and pain well-well. Nobody even sorry am and wi trit am like sey e nor mean anytin.
But E bear di sofa and pain wey suppose bi awa own. But wi tink sey en sofa na di ponishment wey God gi-am.
But dem wound am bikos of awa sin; dem beat am bikos of di bad tins wey wi do. Na di ponishment wey e sofa give us peace and en wounds don make us well.
All of us bi like sheep wey don lost and wi dey waka go awa own way. But God gi-am di ponishment wey suppose bi awa own.
Dem trit and ponish am anyhow, but e put body down kon bear-am like lamb wey dem won go kill and e nor tok anytin.
Dem arrest and sey make dem kill-am and nobody kare about am. Dem kill-am, bikos of awa sins.
Even doh e nor do any bad tin or tok lie, dem plan to put am for grave with wiked pipol but dem kon beri am for rish man grave.”
Na God wont make e sofa and en deat na sakrifice, so dat God go forgive pipol dia sins. So en days go long and e go si en shidren-shidren and thru am, God go do wetin E wont.
But wen e si all di good tins wey en sofa bring, belle go sweet am. My savant wey I like well-well, go bear plenty pipol ponishment and I go forgive dem bikos of am.
So, I go honor and put am for where great men dey, bikos na only en sakrifice en life and dem si am as sina too. E karry evribody sins for en head kon pray so dat God go forgive us.
