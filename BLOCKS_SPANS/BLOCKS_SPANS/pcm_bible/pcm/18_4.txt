Elifaz from Teman kon sey:
â€œJob! Abeg, make yu nor vex for wetin I won tok, bikos I nor fit kwayet again.
Si, yu don tish many pipol and give strent to doz wey dey weak.
Yor words don support pipol wey won fall and yu don give strent to doz wey don taya.
Naw wey e rish yor turn to face trobol, yu nor get heart again. Yu nor fit stand am at-all.
Yu suppose get konfident and hope, bikos yu dey woship and trust God.
Make yu tink am sef, den tell mi wish time pesin wey dey respet God, dey sick.
But I don si and know sey, pesin wey plan bad and evil tins, go use en head karry am.
God dey skata doz kind pipol, bikos E dey vex for dem.
Wiked pipol dey do like lion, but God go skata and break dia tit.
Dem go die like lion wey nor si food chop and all dia shidren go skata.
My savant kom tell mi word small-small, but I nor hear wetin e tok well.
E kom tell mi like sey na dream for nite wen evribody dey sleep.
I fear and all my body kon dey shake.
Na small breeze blow my face kon make my hair stand.
Sometin stand for der and even wen I look, I nor fit si wetin e bi.
E get any man wey dey innocent before God? E get anybody wey dey klean before di Pesin wey kreate am?
If God nor even bilive en savants wey dey heaven; dey si komplain for en angels body,
yu tink sey E go bilive who E make from san; sometin wey bi dust wey fit skata like ant house?
Somebody fit dey alive for morning kon die for nite, before odas go know.
Dem go take evritin wey e get and e die without wisdom.
