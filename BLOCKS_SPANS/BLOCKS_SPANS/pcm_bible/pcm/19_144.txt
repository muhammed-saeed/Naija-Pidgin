David Song
My God, make Yu hear my prayers; make Yu listin as I dey pray! Make Yu ansa mi, bikos Yu dey good and evritin wey Yu dey do, dey rite.
Make Yu nor judge mi yor savant, bikos evribody dey guilty for yor front.
My enemies don porshu mi. Dem don nak mi fall kon force mi stay for darkness like pipol wey dey grave.
I nor get hope again and fear don break my body finish.
I remember before-before as I dey tink about all yor great works and doz tins wey Yu don do.
I lift my hands and pray to Yu. Just as dry land dey hongry for rain, na so too I dey hongry to si Yu.
So, my Oga God, make Yu kwik kom ansa mi, bikos my wahala dey worse evriday. Make Yu nor turn from mi, if not, I go die.
Evry morning, make I dey hear about yor love wey nor dey fail, bikos I trust Yu. Make Yu show mi where to go, bikos I don give mysef to Yu.
Oga God, make Yu save mi from my enemies; bikos I run kom meet Yu make Yu hide mi.
Make Yu tish mi to do wetin Yu wont, bikos Yu bi my God and make yor Holy Spirit guide mi as I dey waka.
My God, make Yu save mi, bikos of di glory wey dey yor name. Save mi from dis wahala, bikos of yor faithfulnes.
Use yor love wey nor dey fail, take silent all my enemies kon distroy dem, bikos I bi yor savant.
