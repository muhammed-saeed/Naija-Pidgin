Wiked pesin dey run wen nobody dey porshu am, but honest pesin dey get heart like lion.
Wen pipol dey always sin, dia kountry go get many leaders, but pesin wey get sense and dey undastand tins well, dey bring peace.
Poor man wey dey opress oda poor pipol, bi like strong rain wey dey skata wetin pesin plant.
So pesin wey nor dey respet di law, dey praiz wiked pipol, but doz wey dey obey di law, nor like wikedness.
Evil pipol nor know wetin korrect judgement mean, but doz wey dey woship God, undastand am well-well.
E betta to dey poor and honest, dan to dey rish and dey do wayo.
Yong man wey dey obey di law get sense. Pesin wey dey make friends with yeye pipol na disgrace to en papa.
If yu get money from intrest wey yu dey kollect, bikos di pipol kon borrow from yu, one day, one pesin go kom kollect all yor propaty and e go sorry for poor pipol.
If yu nor dey obey di law, God nor go hear yor prayers.
If yu deceive honest pesin kon make am do bad tins, yu go fall enter di trap wey yu dig by yorsef, but God go reward innocent pipol well-well.
Rish pipol dey always tink sey dem wise, but poor pesin wey get betta karata, know di rite tin.
Wen good pipol dey rule, evribody dey happy, but wen bad pipol dey rule, evribody dey hide.
Yu nor go ever susid for life if yu try to hide yor sin. Konfess and stop to do dem and God go show yu mesi.
If yu always dey obey God, happiness go follow yu, but yu go distroy yor life if yu dey sturbon.
Just as pipol dey fear hongry lion and wiked bear, na so too poor pipol nor fit fight wiked ruler.
Ruler wey nor get betta sense, go rule with wikedness. But pesin wey nor like lie, go rule tey.
Pesin wey kill anoda pesin dey kwik-kwik dig en own grave, so make yu nor try to stop am.
Dey always tok trut and e go save yu, but if yu dey play wayo, na wons yu go fall.
Farmer wey dey work hard, get plenty food to chop, but pipol wey dey waste time for evritin wey dem dey do, na poverty go kill dem.
Pesin wey dey tok trut, go live betta and happy life, but dem go ponish yu, if yu dey hurry to get money.
To dey judge anyhow nor good, but some judge dey lie for kourt, bikos of di small bribe wey dem won kollect.
Pesin wey get long-trot dey always hurry to get money, sotey e nor dey know wen poverty dey kom meet am.
If yu korrect pesin, e go like am pass wen yu praiz am.
Pesin wey tink sey e nor bad to tif from en papa and mama, nor betta pass ordinary tif.
To get long-trot dey only kause trobol, so e betta make yu trust God.
Pesin wey feel sey na only en know di korrect tin, na big fool, but pesin wey dey waka with wisdom, go dey save.
Make yu dey always give tins to poor pipol and yu nor go ever lack, but if yu nor dey sorry for poor pipol, dem go curse yu.
Pipol dey hide wen wiked pesin dey rule, but wen e nor dey again, raitious pipol go prosper.
