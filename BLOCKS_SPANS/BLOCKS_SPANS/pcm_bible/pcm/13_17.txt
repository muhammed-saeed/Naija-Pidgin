Wen King David don dey stay en palis, e kon tell Profet Natan, “I dey stay for palis wey dem build with cedar wood, but God Kovenant Box dey for tent!”

“Go tell David my savant sey, ‘Dis na wetin God dey tok: “Make yu nor build house for mi.
Bikos since di time wen I take Israel pipol komot from Egypt kon rish naw, I neva stay for any house. Na difren tent I dey stay for evriwhere.
Even as I travel with Israel pipol rish, I neva tell any leader wey I put before sey, ‘Wetin make yu neva build temple for mi with cedar wood!’ ” ’
So, make yu tell David my savant sey, mi wey bi di Oga God sey, ‘I take yu from where yu dey guide sheep kon make yu lead my pipol, Israel.
I dey follow yu go anywhere wey yu dey go kon let yu win all yor enemies. I go make yu dey popula like all di strong men for dis eart.
I don choose one place for my pipol, Israel and I don put dem for where dem go stay and nobody go opress dem again as dem dey do dem before-before
wen I choose pipol to dey judge dem. I go distroy all yor enemies.’ I pray sey, ‘Mi di Oga yor God go give yu many shidren wey go bi kings.
Wen time don rish for yu to die, I go make one among yor pikin, king kon make en kingdom strong.
Na-im go build temple for mi and I go make sure sey en kingdom dey forever.
I go bi en papa and e go bi my pikin. I go always support am and I nor go leave am as I leave Saul wey yu take-ova from.
I go make am rule my pipol and my kingdom forever; en shidren-shidren go always dey rule.’ ”
So Profet Natan go tell David evritin wey God tell am.
So David enter Tabanako, sidan kon sey, “My Oga God! Na who bi mi and my family wey Yu dey do all dis tins for?
