Awa God, make Yu tink about dis tins wey dey happen to us naw and how awa enemies don disgrace us rish.

Wi must pay money to drink awa own wota and buy awa own firewood too.
Dem really dey porshu us and naw, wi don taya, but wi nor fit rest at-all.
Wi don make agriment with Egypt and Assyria pipol, so dat wi go get enough food to chop make honga nor for kill us.
Na awa grand-grand papa dem sin and dem don die, but naw, wi dey sofa dia ponishment.
Doz wey bi awa slave before, don turn awa oga naw and nobody dey to save us from dia pawa.
Wi dey risk awa life as wi dey find food wey wi go chop, bikos tif many for di towns and di village dem.
Awa skin hot like oven and na honga make us dey sick so.
Enemies don rape awa wifes for Jerusalem and dem don disgrace awa yong girls for Judah town.
Dem hang and kill di kings family kon trit awa eldas anyhow.
Dem karry awa yong men go do strong work and awa boys dey stagga, bikos of di heavy wood wey dem dey karry.
Awa eldas nor fit sidan for di town gate again and di yong men nor dey dance and sing again.
