Make una si as gold nor dey yuzful again. Di gold wey fine and dey shine well-well before, nor dey shine again and di temple stones don skata for di street.
Just as gold dey important and get value, na so too Jerusalem shidren dey important before, but naw, pipol dey trit dem like ordinary pot wey dem make with klay.
Even as jackals wiked rish, dem still dey give dia shidren breast make dem suck, but my pipol wiked like ostrich for desert.
Dia shidren tongue don gum, bikos dem nor si wota drink; dem dey beg waka, but nobody gri give dem food chop.
Pipol wey dey chop betta food before, don turn who dey beg food for street. Pipol wey dey wear fine and betta klot before, don turn who dey wear rag naw.
Di ponishment wey I give my pipol worse pass Sodom pipol own, bikos na wons e take happen and nobody dey to help dem.
Before-before, dia prince dem shine pass snow and white pass milk. Dia body smooth pass rubi stone and wen yu si dem, dem dey shine pass safaya stone.
But naw, dia face don black pass black powder and wen dem dey waka for street, pipol nor even know dem again. Dia body don tin finish and dem dry like dry wood.
Pipol wey die for war, betta pass doz wey hongry kill, bikos na food wey dem nor si chop, kill dem.
Wen dem distroy my pipol, even wimen wey love dia shidren, dey kook dem chop, bikos of honga.
But naw, God don pour en vexnashon finish. E don send fire kon burn Jerusalem town rish groun.
Before, pipol and kings for oda nashons nor ever tink sey enemies go fit attack Jerusalem, tok-less of to skata am.
But dis tin happen, bikos of di sin wey di profets and di priests kommit and bikos of di innocent pipol for di town, wey dem kill.
Dem dey waka anyhow for di street like sey dem nor dey si; dis na bikos dem don stain diasef with blood and naw, pipol nor fit tosh dem again.
Naw, pipol dey shaut for dem anyhow sey, “Komot for here! Una wey dey smell! Make una nor tosh us!” So dem kon komot der go anoda town, but any town wey dem waka go, di pipol dey porshu dem.
Na God skata dem and E nor dey help dem again. Pipol nor dey respet dia priests or honor di leaders again.
Naw, awa eyes dey pain us well-well, bikos wi dey wait for pipol to kom help us. But wi just dey wait for nor-tin, bikos dem nor go fit help us.
Awa enemies dey wosh awa movement and naw, wi nor fit waka for di street again. Awa days for dis world don almost finish, bikos wi go soon die.
Doz wey dey porshu us, fast pass eagle wey dey fly for sky. Dem porshu us pass di mountin kon set trap for us for wildaness.
Dem katch di pesin wey make us dey alive, di king wey God choose and wi bin get hope sey e go protet us from awa enemies.
Edom pipol wey dey stay for Uz land, make una dey laf naw. Make una know sey dis judgement cup go rish where una dey too; una go drink from am until di drink don shark una and una go kon naked.
Jerusalem pipol, God nor go ponish una again, instead E go take una komot from Babilon go back to una own land. But una wey kom from Edom, make una nor worry, God go ponish una, bikos of una sins.
