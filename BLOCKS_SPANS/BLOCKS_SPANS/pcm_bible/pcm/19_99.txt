Make una sing new song for God, bikos E don do wonderful tins! E dey diliver pipol with en rite and strong hand.

So make all di eart shaut to God; make all of dem bigin praiz and sing for joy!
Make dem sing dia praiz give God with harp, sweet-sweet songs,
trumpets and di sound from ram horn. Make una sing with praiz, before di King wey bi awa God.
Make di sea and evritin wey dey inside, shaut praiz God! Make di eart and evry living tin join dem too.
Make di rivers klap dia hand as dem dey praiz God. Make di hills sing dia song for joy
before awa Oga God, bikos E dey kom judge di whole world. E go judge di whole world well kon judge evribody, with raitiousness.
