David Song
Wen I dey face trobol, I kry to God and E ansa my prayer.
My God, make Yu save mi from pipol wey dey lie and deceive odas.
Una wey sabi lie well-well, una know how God go take ponish una? Una know how una wahala go plenty rish?
Dem go shuk una with sharp arrow kon burn una with hot shako from fire.
I really sofa for Meshak town and e pain mi well-well sey I stay with Kedar pipol.
I don taya to stay among pipol wey nor like peace.
I dey look for peace; but wen ever I tok about am, na war dem dey give mi.
