For Di Kwayamasta: David Song
My God, make Yu ansa mi wen I koll Yu. Na only Yu go fit diliver and free mi from wiked pipol and all my trobol. Make Yu sorry for mi kon hear my prayers.
Na how long pipol go take dey tok bad about mi? How long una go dey tok wetin I nor do? How long una go kontinue to dey lie for my head?
Make una know sey, God dey keep doz wey dey fear am for ensef and E go ansa wen wi koll am.
So make yu fear God and nor sin. Make yu tink about am for nite kon turn from yor sins.
Make yu offa sakrifice with di rite spirit give God kon trust am.
Many pipol dey sey, “Who go fit show us wetin dey good?” So my God, make Yu smile for us.
Yu don give mi more joy pass doz wey get many food and wine to drink.
I dey sleep with peace, bikos na only Yu wey bi my God, dey save mi.
