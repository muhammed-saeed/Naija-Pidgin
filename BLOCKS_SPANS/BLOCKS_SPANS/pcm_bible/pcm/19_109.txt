David Song
My God, I don make up my mind! I go sing and praiz Yu with all my heart!
Jita and trumpet, make una wake-up! I go wake-up for early morning kon praiz Yu with song from my mout.
My God, for evribody present, I go tank Yu. I go sing yor praiz among di nashons.
Bikos yor love wey nor dey fail, high pass di heavens. Yor faithfulnes dey rish di kloud.
My God, make all praiz bi yor own and make dem high pass di heavens. Make yor glory kover di whole eart.
Naw, make Yu save di pipol wey Yu love. Make Yu ansa and save us with yor pawa.
As God holy rish, E kon promise sey, “I go defeat di pipol kon divide Shekem land with joy, den I go measure Sukkot Valley.
Na mi get Gilead and Manasseh! Efraim wey I dey wear like helmet for head, go produce strong sojas and Judah wey I dey wear for body like war klot, go produce kings.
But Moab na my wosh-hand basin; dem bi my savant and I go use Edom take klean my legs kon happy, bikos I don win Filistia pipol.”
So, who go take mi enter di strong town? Who go fit help mi win Edom pipol?
My God, Yu don rijet us? Yu nor go follow awa sojas go fight war again?
Abeg, make Yu help us fight awa enemies, bikos human being help, dey yuzles
and wi know sey, with God help, wi go do mighty-mighty tins, bikos E go distroy all awa enemies.
