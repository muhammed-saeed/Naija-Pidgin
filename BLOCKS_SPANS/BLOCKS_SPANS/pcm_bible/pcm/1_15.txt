Afta all dis tins, God tok to Abram for vishon: “Abram! Make yu nor fear! Na mi dey guide yu and yor reward go big well-well.”
But Abram sey, “My Oga God wey get pawa, wetin Yu go give mi, since I neva born pikin and na dis Elieza for Damaskus go inherit my propaty?”
Abram still sey, “Since Yu neva give mi shidren, den one of my savants go inherit my propaty!”
But God sey: “Yor savant nor go inherit yor propaty, but na yor own pikin wey go kom from yor blood.”
God take am go outside kon sey, “Look di sky and yu go si di stars, den try if yu fit kount dem!” Den God sey, “Na as di stars bi for up, na so yor shidren go plenty rish.”

So Abram take all of dem go gi-am kon kut dem into two, den e put di two side face each oda, but e nor kut di birds.
Wen birds for sky won kon chop di tins wey Abram kill so, e kon porshu all of dem komot.
