Sabat Day Song
E dey good to tank God. Yes! Awa belle dey sweet us wen ever wi dey sing and praiz di Most High God.
For morning, e dey good to tok about yor love wey nor dey fail and for evening, wi go sing of yor faithfulnes,
with harp wey get ten rope and jita.
My God, Yu dey make mi happy bikos of evritin wey Yu do and I go sing praiz Yu, bikos Yu dey good to mi.
Wi dey si di great work wey Yu do! Di tins wey Yu dey tink, deep well-well.
Who nor get sense nor go fit know wetin Yu dey do and na only fools nor go undastand sey:
“Wiked pipol dey grow like grass and doz wey dey do evil dey prosper, but God go distroy dem forever.”
But Yu, my Oga God, dem go praiz Yu forever.
Yor enemies go die trowey and all di pipol wey dey do evil, go skata.
But Yu don make mi strong like melu wey dey bush and use oil wey fine pass, take anoint mi.
My eyes don si my enemies dey fall and my ear don hear as God win doz wiked pipol.
But doz wey dey fear God, go prosper like bambo tree and dem go strong as dem dey grow like cedar tree for Lebanon.
Bikos God don plant dem for en house, dem go grow well.
Dem go still dey produce fruit for old age! Dem go dey strong and fresh well-well.
Dem go sey, “God dey judge well! Na-im bi awa Rock and E nor dey do bad tin!”
