“Before I put yu for yor mama belle, I don know and choose yu. I don selet yu, before dem even born yu. Yes! I don choose yu as my profet and yu go take my message go evriwhere.”
So I ansa, “My Oga God, I nor sabi tok well and I still yong too.”
But God sey, “Make yu nor sey, ‘I still yong.’ But yu go-go meet anybody wey I send yu go meet kon tell dem evritin wey I kommand yu.
Di pipol wey I dey send yu go meet, make yu nor fear dem, bikos I go dey with yu and I go save yu. Mi wey bi God, don tok!”

So make yu know naw sey, I don give yu pawa ova nashons and kingdoms; to rut and skata; to distroy, ova-take, ribuild and to plant well again.”
Afta, God koll and ask mi: “Jeremaya! Wetin yu dey si?” I ansa, “Na one almond tree branch.”
Den God sey, “Yu dey rite and dis mean sey, I dey look well to make sure sey evritin go happen, just as I tok am.”
