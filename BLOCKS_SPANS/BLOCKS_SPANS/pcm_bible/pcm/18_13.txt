â€œTrue-true, my eyes don si all dis tins, my ear don hear dem and I undastand dem well.
Wetin yu know, I know am too. Mi and yu na di same.
But I wish sey I fit tok to God, nor bi yu. I won make mi and God setol dis matter.
Yu bi oga for lie-lie; yu bi like doctor wey nor fit trit pesin wey dey sick.
If to sey yu just kwayet, dat for bi wisdom for yu.
So naw make yu listin to my words; listin as I dey beg.
Yu won use lie defend God? Abi all dis yor wayo argument na to help God?
Abi yu dey try to tok for am? Na yu won tok for God?
If God look yu well-well, E go si any good tin for yor body? Yu feel sey yu fit fool God as yu dey fool human being?
Even if yu dey pritend sey yu dey sorry for mi, God go still katch and ponish yu.
Abi en pawa nor go make yu fear? Yu sure sey di fear nor go kill yu so?
Di words wey yu dey tok nor dey good at-all, dem dey yuzles like ashes; dem dey skata for groun like klay.
Make yu shut up yor mout, so dat I go tok. Wetin go bi, go bi.
Why I dey risk my life like dis? Why I dey take decision for mysef?
Even if E kill mi, I go still dey bilive am; I go still tell am wetin dey do mi!
E fit bi sey my boldness fit save mi, bikos know wiked pesin go try sey e won face God.
Naw, make yu listin to wetin I dey try to tok; make yu open yor ear well.
I don dey ready to komplain gi-am, bikos I know sey I dey rite.
Anybody fit argue with mi for dis matter? But if Yu sey I dey wrong, I go kwayet till I die.
Abeg make I ask for two tins and make Yu do dem for mi, den I nor go hide from Yu.
Make Yu remove yor hand from my life and nor make mi fear again.
God, make Yu koll mi and I go ansa or make I tok, so dat Yu go ansa mi?
Wish kind sin I kommit sef? Wish kind bad tin I do? Wish kind wrong tin Yu sey I do?
Why Yu dey hide from mi? Why Yu dey trit mi like sey I bi yor enemy?
Na ordinary leaf wey breeze dey blow Yu won fight? Abi na dry leaf Yu won porshu?
Yu just dey rite bad tins against mi; even di ones wey I kommit wen I bi small pikin.
Yu don put big shain for my leg and evriwhere wey I waka go, Yu dey wosh mi.
Naw, I don turn rotin wood and I bi like klot wey worm chop anyhow.
