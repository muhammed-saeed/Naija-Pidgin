David Song
Pipol wey trust God dey sikure like Mount Zion; nobody go fit bend dem and dem go dey forever.
Just as mountin gada round Jerusalem, na so too God dey round en pipol, both naw and forever.
Wiked pipol nor go rule pipol wey dey fear and obey God, if not, doz wey dey obey God fit start to do bad tins too.
My God, make Yu do good to pipol wey dey good; doz wey dia heart and mind dey with Yu,
but make Yu ponish pipol wey dey do bad tins. Ponish dem with all di oda wiked pipol. Make peace always dey Israel land!
