David Song
I bilive and trust sey God go protet mi. So wetin make yu dey sey, “Fly like bird go hide for mountin, so dat yu go dey save,
bikos wiked pipol dey wound innocent pipol anyhow. Dem hide for darkness dey shot good pipol with dia bow and arrow.
So, naw wey di foundashon don skata, wetin good pipol go fit do?”
But God dey for en holy temple; E dey rule from heaven. E dey look as evribody dey live dia life for dis eart.
God dey si both good and bad pipol. E hate doz wey love wahala.
E go burn wiked pipol with shako, sulfur and fire kon distroy dem with strong breeze.
God dey good and E dey judge well; so E go favor doz wey dey do good too.
