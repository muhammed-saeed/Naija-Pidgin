Den di fift angel blow en trumpet and I si one star wey fall from heaven kom eart and dem gi-am di key wey e go use take open di pit.
Wen e open am, smoke kom out like fire kon turn di sun and breeze to darkness.
From inside di smoke, grasshoppa bigin enter di eart and dem give dem pawa like skorpion own.
Di angel tell dem, “Make una nor distroy di grass, plants and trees, but distroy only di pipol wey God mark nor dey dia fore head.”
E still tell dem, “Nor kill di pipol wey nor get God mark for dia forehead, but make una sofa dem for five monts with pain wey bi like skorpion own.”
For dat time, pipol go look for deat, but dem nor go si am. Dem go won die, but deat go run from dem.
Di grasshoppa bi like horse wey dey ready for war. Wetin dey dia head, bi like gold crown and dia face bi like human being own.
Dia hair bi like wimen hair and dia tit bi like lion own.
Wetin dem wear bi like bullet proof wey dem make with iron and dia feada dey make nois like horse wey dey go fight.
Dia tail dey bite like skorpion own and di angel give dem pawa to sofa pipol for five monts.
Na dia king bi di angel wey kom from di pit and en name for Hibru, na Abaddon and for Greek, na Apollon (pesin wey dey distroy).
Di first wahala don pass, but two oda one still dey kom.
Den di sixt angel blow en trumpet and I hear one vois dey tok from di for horns wey dey di gold altar for God present.
Di vois kon tell di angels wey whole di trumpets sey, “Make yu release di for angels wey dem tie for River Eufrates!”
If dem divide di pipol for dis eart into three, dem release di angels wey dem don prepare for dis hour, day, mont and year, sey make dem go kill one part finish.
I hear as dia sojas many rish and dem many rish 200,000.
For my vishon, I still si many horse and doz wey dey ride dem: And di bullet proof wey dis pipol wear, red like fire kon get dark blue and yellow kolour. Di horse dem head bi like lion own and fire, smoke and sulfur, dey kom out from dia mout.
If dem divide di pipol for dis eart into three, di diziz wey bi like fire, smoke and sulfur wey dey kom out from dia mout, kill one part finish.
Di horse pawa dey for dia mout and tail. Dia tail mout bi like snake own and dem get pawa to wound and kill pipol.
But di pipol wey dis tins nor kill, nor still gri turn from sin kom meet God wey go save dem. Dem kontinue to serve demon and juju wey dem make with gold, silva, bronze, stone and wood. Dis juju nor dey si, hear or waka.
And instead of dem to turn kom meet God, dem still dey kill pipol; do majik; dey sleep with who nor bi dia husband or wife and still dey tif.
