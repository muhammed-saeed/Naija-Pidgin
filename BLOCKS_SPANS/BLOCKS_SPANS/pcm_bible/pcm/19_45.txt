David Song Wey Korah Shidren Sing
My God, wi don hear am with awa own ear and awa grand-grand papa dem don tell us about evritin wey Yu do for dia time.
Yu use yor pawa take porshu doz wey nor dey fear Yu kon give all di land to awa grand-grand papa dem. Yu skata dia enemies kon free awa grand-grand papa.
Dem nor win di land with dia swod and nor bi dia own strong hand make dem win, but na yor rite and strong hand with di shinin-shinin lite from yor face, help dem, bikos Yu love dem.
Na Yu bi my King and God. Na Yu make Israel pipol win.
Na yor pawa wi go take porshu awa enemies; na yor name wi dey take mash dem for groun.
I nor trust my bow, I nor put hope sey my swod go save mi,
but na Yu make us fit win awa enemies kon disgrace doz wey hate us.
My God, wi go always dey give Yu glory and praiz yor name forever and ever.
But naw, Yu don rijet and disgrace us. Yu nor dey follow awa sojas go fight again.
Yu make us run from awa enemies kon allow pipol wey hate us, pak awa propaty.
Yu don busher us give dem like animal wey dem won chop kon skata us among di nashons.
Na one-one kobo Yu sell yor special pipol and Yu nor gain anytin from inside.
Yu don let awa neighbours dey laf us. Pipol wey dey around dey take us make yeye.
Yu don make us di topik for dia joke; dem dey shake dia head for us like sey wi bi fools.
Na sofa and curse bi my own evriday; dem don rite shame put for my fore head.
Doz wey dey laf mi, na only dia vois I dey always hear and na only my enemies wey dey ponish mi, I dey si.
Even doh all dis tins dey happen to us, wi neva forget Yu. Wi neva go against yor kovenant.
Na only Yu dey awa heart and wi still dey follow yor ways.
Yu don skata us for groun like dirty wey dog dey run pass; Yu don kover us with darkness.
If wi don rijet awa Oga God kon dey pray to anoda god,
E go know, bikos E know wetin dey evribody mind.
Yet bikos of am, dem dey kill us evriday; dey trit us like sheep wey dem won kill.
So, my God, make Yu wake-up! Wetin make Yu dey sleep? Make Yu get up! Make Yu nor rijet us forever.
Why Yu dey look di oda side? Wetin make Yu do like sey Yu nor know sey wi dey sofa and wiked pipol dey opress us?
Wi don faint for groun kon sleep for dirty.
So my God, make Yu kom help us! Save us bikos of yor love wey nor dey fail.
