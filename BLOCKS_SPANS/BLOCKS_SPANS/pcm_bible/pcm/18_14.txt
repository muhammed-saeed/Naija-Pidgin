“Na short life na-im man wey woman born get and na trobol full am.
Wi dey grow and dry kwik-kwik like flower; wi dey vanish like shadow and nor-tin dey remain.
Yu dey open eye look dis kind pesin? Yu go gri judge mi so?
No klean tin fit kom from wetin nor klean like human being.
Yu know as human being life bi from di biginnin. Even di nomba of dia days wey dem go live, Yu don setol am and Yu nor dey shange.
So make Yu live us alone make wi rest! Wi bi like pipol wey dem hire to work, so allow us finish awa work with peace.
“Tree wey dem don kut for groun get hope, bikos e fit still grow again and e nor go die.
Even if di rut don old and dia part dem don dey die,
wen wota tosh am, e go grow like seed wey dem just plant.
But if pesin die, na di end bi dat. Dem don die; so where dem dey naw?
Like wota wey stop to flow and river wey dry,
na so too pipol wey die nor go kom back again. Dem nor go fit si di sky for day time again, bikos dem don sleep go.
“I wish sey Yu go hide mi for where dead body dey; den wen Yu nor dey vex again, Yu go remember mi.
If pesin don die, e fit kom back to life? But I go wait for betta time wen dis trobol don pass mi.
Den, Yu go koll and I go ansa and Yu go kon like mi wey Yu use yor hand take make.
“Naw, bikos na Yu dey kount my steps, Yu nor go kount my sins again.
Yu go forgive and kover my sins. Yu go tie dem put for bag.
Just as mountin dey fall and rocks dey move from where dem dey.
Just as wota dey wosh stone klean and heavy rain dey wosh di san, na so too Yu take distroy awa hope for life.
Yor pawa strong pass awa own. Yu porshu us komot for dis life. Wen wi die, Yu dey make us resemble anoda tin.
Even if awa pikin win award, wi nor go know, bikos wen pesin don die, e nor dey know wetin dey happen again.
But en body go pain am and en soul go kry for am.”
