God kon tell mi again sey:
“Man pikin, go meet Jerusalem pipol about di bad tins wey dem do kon tell dem sey
‘Dis na wetin God wey get pawa dey tell Jerusalem: “Na Kanaan land dem for born yu. Yor papa kom from Amor and yor mama na from Hit.
Wen dem born yu, nobody kut di rope wey join yu and yor mama togeda or sey dem wosh and rub yu with salt or wrap yu put inside klot.
Nobody sorry for yu kon do any of dis tins for yu. Wen dem born yu, nobody love yu and dem trowey yu for open field.
“ ‘ “Den wen I dey pass, I si yu dey roll for inside yor own blood for groun. Blood kover yor full body, but I nor fit look make yu dey die.
So I make yu grow like betta seed wey dem plant. Yu strong as yu dey grow and yu tall like fine woman. Yor breast dey okay and yor hair fine well-well, but yu dey naked.
“ ‘ “As I dey waka pass again, I kon si sey di time wey yu suppose to undastand wetin love mean, don rish. So, I kover yor naked body with my klot kon promise sey I go always love yu. Yes, I marry yu and yu kon bi my own.” ’ ” Dis na wetin God wey get pawa dey tok.
“Leta, I take wota wosh di blood komot yor body kon rub olive oil for yor skin.
I dress yu with klot wey dem design well kon give yu shoe wey dem make with betta leader, den I put priest kap wey dem make with linen for yor head.
I still wear jewel and difren shains for yor neck.
I give yu one nose ring, ear-ring and one fine crown make yu wear.
Yu getdifrengoldandsilva andyu always deywearklotweydemmakewith betta linen and silk. Yu dey chop bread wey dem make with di best flower and yu get many honey and olive oil to drink. Yor beauti dey shine and yu bi kween.
Bikos of di wey yu fine rish, evribody know yu for evriwhere, bikos na mi make yu fine well-well. Dis na wetin God wey get pawa dey tok.
“Bikos yu fine, yu kon bigin do anyhow and dey sleep with anybody wey yu si.
Yu design di place where yu for dey woship yor juju with yor klot like sey na ashawo house and yu kon dey sleep with evribody for der.
I give yu fine silva and gold make yu dey wear, but naw, yu don use dem make juju wey yu dey sleep with.
Yu take di fine-fine klot wey I give yu kon wear dem give di juju and di olive oil wey I give yu, yu still dey offa am give di juju.
I give yu food; di best flower, olive oil and honey, but yu sakrifice dem give di juju sey, Make yu protet mi.” Dis na wetin God wey get pawa dey tok.
“Den di shidren wey yu born for mi, yu sakrifice dem give di juju too. Like sey di ashawo wey yu dey do nor bad rish,
yu still go sakrifice my shidren give juju.
Even as yu dey do ashawo waka, yu nor remember di days wen yu dey small, naked for groun and dey roll for yor blood.”
God sey, “Si di kind sofa wey dey wait yu bikos of yor many evil and as
yu build where dem go for woship yor juju for evry street for di town.
Yu trowey yor beauti for portor-portor, bikos anybody wey kom meet yu, yu dey sleep with am and yor ashawo dey strong evriday.
Yor ashawo friends wey kom from Egypt, yu let dem sleep with yu and naw, yor ashawo life dey make mi vex.
Naw, I don raiz my hand won ponish yu kon take yor share for di blessing, komot yor hand. I don give yu to Filistia pipol; pipol wey hate yu and dem nor like di life wey yu dey live.
Bikos nor-tin dey rish yu, yu kon dey follow Assyria pipol. Even doh yu bi dia ashawo, dem nor still dey okay for yu.
Yu still bi ashawo for Babilon wey get business men, but dem nor rish yu too.”
So dis na wetin God wey get pawa dey tok: “Yu don do all dis tins like ashawo wey nor get shame for eye.
For evry street, yu build where pipol go for dey woship juju and learn ashawo. But yu still betta pass ordinary ashawo, bikos yu get money.
“Yu bi like wife wey nor love en husband, instead e dey sleep with strenjas anyhow.
Pipol dey pay ashawo, but yor own difren, bikos na yu dey give pipol gift make dem for kom sleep with yu.
Yor ashawo dey difren, bikos nobody sey yu must bi ashawo. Nobody dey pay, instead na yu dey pay dem! True-true, yor ashawo dey difren.”
So, Jerusalem, make yu hear mi naw! Hear wetin God dey tok.
Dis na wetin God wey get pawa dey tok: “Yu tear yor klot komot body kon give yor body to yor lovers dem and all yor juju, den yu kill and sakrifice yor shidren give juju too.
Bikos of dis, I go bring all di pipol wey yu love togeda; di ones wey yu like and doz wey yu hate. Dem go round yu like circol, den I go tear yor klot komot yor body kon let dem si yor nakednes.
I go distroy yu, bikos of yor ashawo life and doz wey yu kill. Den with my vexnashon, I go ponish yu till yu die.
I go put yu for dia hand and dem go skata di place where yu for dey serve juju and do ashawo. Dem go take yor klot and gold go and yu go dey naked.
Dem go gada crowd kon stone yu, den dem go use dia swod take kut yu to pieces.
Dem go burn yor house and many wimen go si as dem dey ponish yu. I go make yu stop ashawo work and doz wey love yu, yu nor go give dem gift again.
Den I nor go vex again and I go kwayet. I nor go dey vex or jealous again.
“Since yu don forget how I kare for yu wen yu bi small pikin and yu don make bi vex with all di tins wey yu dey do, I must pay yu back for all dis bad tins. But, wetin make yu dey do ashawo join di bad-bad tins wey yu do?” God wey get pawa don tok.
God sey, “Jerusalem, pipol go use dis tins take tok about yu: ‘Like mama, like pikin.’
Yu really bi yor mama pikin. Yor mama run leave en husband and shidren. Yu bi like yor sista wey hate en husband and shidren too. Yu and Hit wey bi di oda town get di same mama and na Amor bi una papa.
Yor senior sista na Samaria for nort. Yor yonga sista na Sodom for sout.
Yu like as yu dey do di bad tins wey dem do? No! But e nor even tey before yor own worse pass dia own.
So as long as mi wey bi God dey alive, I dey sey, ‘Yor sista, Sodom and en village nor ever do di wiked tins wey yu and yor village don do.’
“Yor sista and en pikin dey karry body up, bikos dem get enough to chop and dem dey stay for peace, but dem nor gri kare for poor pipol and doz wey nor get to chop.
Dem proud and sturbon kon dey do tins wey I nor like and na dis make mi distroy dem, just as all of yu know.
Samaria nor do half of di bads tins wey yu do. Yu ways bad well-well pass dia own. Bikos of di bad tins wey yu dey do, e kon bi like sey yor sistas nor even do any bad tin at-all.
So naw, make yu bear di shame wey dey kom. Yor sins bad pass yor sistas own, sotey if dem look yu, dem go sey, ‘Wi nor even do anytin.’ Naw, make yu bear yor shame and pain, bikos yu don make yor sistas bi like good pesin.”
God tell Jerusalem, “Sodom and Samaria town, I go make una grow and prosper again.
Yu go shame for yorsef and yor disgrace go show yor sistas sey dem even dey good pass yu.
But wen di time don rish, I go make dem prosper again and I go ribuild yu and yor town.
Dat time wey yu dey proud, shebi yu dey laf Sodom
wen yor wikedness neva bring yu kom out? Naw, yu just bi like am, bikos Edom, Filistia pipol and yor neighbours wey hate yu, dey laf yu naw.
Yu must sofa for all di wiked and bad tins wey yu don do.” God don tok.
God kon sey, “Na as I suppose trit yu, I go trit yu, bikos yu nor gri do wetin yu promise and yu break di kovenant.
But I go still do di kovenant wey I make with yu wen yu dey small. I go make kovenant with yu wey go last forever.
Yu go remember how yu bihave, den shame go katch yu wen yor senior and yonga sista go kom back kon meet yu. I go let dem bi like yor pikin.
I go renew my kovenant with yu and yu go know sey na mi bi God.
I go forgive yu all di bad tins wey yu don do, but wen yu remember dem, shame nor go let yu open yor mout.” God wey get pawa don tok.
