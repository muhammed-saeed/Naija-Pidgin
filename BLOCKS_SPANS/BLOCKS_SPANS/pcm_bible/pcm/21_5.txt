Make yu dey kareful wen yu enter God temple, bikos to kom meet God make E tish yu, betta pass foolish sakrifice and pipol wey dey offa am, nor know sey wetin dem dey do, nor good.
Make yu tink well-well before yu tok or before yu make promise give God. God dey heaven and yu dey dis eart, so make yu nor dey tok too mush.
Too mush tinkin dey kause bad dream and di more yu tok, di more yu go dey tok like fool.
Wen yu promise God sometin, make yu do am kwik-kwik, bikos E nor get anytin to do with fools. So make yu do wetin yu promise.
E betta make yu nor promise dan to make promise wey yu nor go fit keep or pay.
Nor allow yor mout make yu sin and nor go defend yorsef give pastor sey, “Na mistake I take make di promise.” Dat kind tin go make God vex for yu and E fit distroy evritin wey yu don work for!
Bikos many dreams and tok-tok nor mean anytin, so make yu dey fear God.
Nor sopraiz wen dem dey opress poor pipol or as bad judgement dey kover good judgement. Dis na bikos, di lowa ofisas must do wetin dia senior ofisas orda dem to do.
Na evribody dey enjoy wetin di land dey produce; even king dey put hope for wetin dem harvest from farm.
Pipol wey like money, even di one wey dem get, nor dey rish dem and doz wey like propaty, wetin dem get, nor dey rish dem too. Dis kind behaviour dey yuzles too.
Di more yu get, di more pipol go kom help yu spend am; di only gain for inside, na sey yu get money.
Pipol wey dey work hard, dey sleep well for nite; weda dem chop small or plenty food. But pipol wey too rish, nor dey even fit sleep at-all.
E get anoda sirious problem wey I don si for dis world. Pesin money fit bring wahala for am.
E go put am for bad business kon luz evritin. For di end, nor-tin remain to leave for en shidren.
Just as pesin kom out from en mama belle naked, na so too e go-go back naked and e nor go karry anytin follow body.
Dis one too na anoda sirious problem. Just as pesin take kom, na so too e go take go back. And dia hard work na for nor-tin, e just bi like wen yu dey try to katch breeze.
Wen e dey alive, na darkness e for dey chop and na pain and sickness full en body.
I still don notis one tin, at least, dis one dey good: E good for pipol to chop, drink and enjoy dia work for di short time wey God give dem to live dia life, bikos na so God wont am.
E still good wen God bless yu with money, propaty and good health wey yu go take enjoy dem. To enjoy yor work and asept di life wey God give yu, na big gift from God.
God dey always make dat kind pesin enjoy en life and e nor dey worry about anytin.
