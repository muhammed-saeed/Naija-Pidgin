David Song
Wen God take wi en pipol go back to Zion from Babilon, E bi like sey wi dey dream!
Wi bigin laf kon dey sing for joy. So di oda nashons kon sey, “Di Oga God don do good tin for dis pipol o-o.”
Yes, God don do betta tin for us, so awa joy don plenty!
Oga God, just as wota dey make dry land fresh, na so too Yu go do for us wen Yu give us awa propaty back.
Pipol wey sofa plant dia seed, go harvest wetin dem plant with happiness.
Dem dey kry as dem dey go plant dia seed, but dem go dey sing with joy as dem dey kom back with wetin dem harvest.
