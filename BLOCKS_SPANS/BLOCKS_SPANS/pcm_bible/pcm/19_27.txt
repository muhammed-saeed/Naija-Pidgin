David Song
My God, my hand klean and I trust Yu with all my heart, so make Yu show sey I dey innocent.
O my God, make Yu look mi well-well, den test my heart, so dat Yu go know wetin I dey tink.
Bikos I dey sure about yor love wey nor dey fail and I dey live my life, just as Yu sey make I leave am.
I nor get time to spend with lie-lie pipol or waka with dem.
I hate to dey where bad pipol dey and I nor go ever follow wiked pipol waka.
My God, I dey live my life well, so dat I go fit kom yor altar
kom tank and tell Yu about all di wonderful tins wey Yu don do.
Oga God, I love yor temple; di place where Yu dey and where yor glory for dey shine.
Make Yu nor let mi sofa with my enemies and nor kill mi with wiked pipol.
Dia hands dirty with di wiked tins wey dem don do and dem dey always take bribe.
But I nor bi like dat; I dey live betta life. So, make Yu kom save and sorry for mi.
Naw, I dey save and I don join di pipol wey dey woship Yu, so I go praiz my God.
