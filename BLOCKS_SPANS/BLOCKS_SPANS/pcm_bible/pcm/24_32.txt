God tok to mi for di tent year wey Zedekaya bi king for Judah and dat na di eighteent year wey Nebukadnezzar dey rule Babilon.
For dat time, Babilon sojas attack Jerusalem and dem kon lock mi for di kourtyard wey dey di royal palis.
King Zedekaya put mi for prison, bikos I tell am sey, “God sey, ‘I go allow Babilon king seize dis town
and yu, King Zedekaya, nor go eskape. Dem go give Zedekaya to Babilon king and both of dem go tok face-to-face.
Dem go take Zedekaya go Babilon and e go stay der until I don deal with am finish. Even if e fight Babilon pipol, e nor go win. Mi, wey bi God, don tok.’ ”
Jeremaya sey, “God tell mi sey
Hanamel wey bi yor papa broda Shallum pikin, go kom meet yu. So make yu buy en field wey dey for Anatot, for Benjamin land, bikos yu bi en klose relashon and yu get rite to buy am.
So, Hanamel kom meet mi for di kourtyard sey make I buy en field, just as God tok. Den, I kon know sey, God really tok to mi.
So I buy di field from Hanamel kon pay am seventeen pieces for silva.
I sign and pipol witness evritin wey wi do, den I weigh di money for skale for am.
I take di two paper wey wi sign as agriment (dem kontain di kontract and di kondishon)
kon gi-am to Baruk wey Mahseaya pikin Neraya born. I give dem to am for Hanamel, di witness wey sign di agriment and all Jew pipol wey sidan for di kourtyard, present.
I tell Baruk for dia present sey,
‘Israel God wey dey mighty don orda sey, “Make yu take di two paper kon put dem inside klay pot, so dat dem go dey save.”
Israel God sey, “Pipol go buy many house, field and vineyard for dis land, again.” ’
“Afta I don give Baruk di agriment paper wey I take buy di land, I kon pray,
‘My Oga God! Na Yu kreate heaven and eart with yor mighty pawa and great strent. Nor-tin dey hard for Yu to do!
Yu don show betta love to many-many pipol and Yu don still ponish pipol, bikos of dia papa and mama sin. Yu bi great God wey get pawa well-well and Yu dey rule evritin.
Yu dey make betta plan kon do mighty tins. Yu know evritin wey pipol dey do and Yu dey reward dem akordin to wetin dem do.
Yu do strong and wonderful tins for Egypt and Yu still dey do dem till naw, both for Israel and for all di nashon and naw, dem don know Yu for evriwhere.
Yu use yor mighty pawa and great strent take do mirakles and wonders wey make fear katch awa enemies. Na like dis Yu take bring yor pipol, Israel kom back from Egypt land.
Yu give dem di rish and betta land wey Yu promise dia grand-grand papa.
But wen dem kom dis land kon dey stay as dia own, dem nor kon dey obey yor kommand or do wetin Yu tish dem; dem nor do wetin Yu orda dem to do and na dis make Yu distroy dem.
Si as Babilon pipol build dia kamp round di town and dem won seize and attack am. Dem go win, bikos war, honga and diziz don already dey kill yor pipol. Naw, make Yu si sey evritin wey Yu tok, don dey happen.
Even doh Yu know sey Babilon pipol won seize di land, na Yu my Oga God, still orda sey make I go buy di field and do di agriment for pipol present.’
“Den God ansa mi,
‘Na mi bi di Oga wey bi evribody God. Nor-tin too hard for mi to do.
So, mi wey bi God sey, “I go give dis town to King Nebukadnezzar for Babilon and en sojas and dem go seize
and burn am rish groun. Dem go burn am with di house where pipol for don make mi vex, bikos dem dey burn incense give Baal juju on-top di house and dey pour wine as ofrin give oda gods.
Dis tin go happen, bikos from di biginnin kon rish naw, Israel and Judah pipol don disobey and make mi vex, bikos of wetin dem do.
E go happen bikos since dem build dis town kon rish naw, di pipol for dis town don make mi vex well-well, so I go distroy am.
I go must do am, bikos of di bad-bad tins wey Judah and Jerusalem pipol don do. Bikos of di wiked tins wey dem do, I go distroy am with both dia king, leaders, priests and profets.
Instead of dem to obey mi, dem turn dia back give mi. And even as I dey try to tish dem rish, dem nor gri learn or listin.
Dem even go put dia yeye juju for di temple wey dem build to woship mi and naw, dem don make am dirty.
Dem build altar for Baal juju for Ben-Hinnom Valley where dem for dey sakrifice dia shidren give Molek god. I nor sey make dem do like dis and I neva even tink about dis kind tin at-all.”
“ ‘Jeremaya! Yu and di pipol korrect wen una sey war, honga and diziz go make dis town fall and Babilon king go seize am. Naw, make yu listin to wetin I get to tok about dis town:
“I go gada all my pipol from di kountry where I skata dem put, bikos I bin dey vex and I go bring dem back to dis land, so dat dem go dey save.
Den, dem go bi my pipol and I go bi dia God.
Di only tin wey I go let dem do for dis life: na to always dey honor mi, bikos na for dem and dia shidren-shidren good.
I go make kovenant wey nor dey end with dem sey I nor go ever stop to do good tins for dem and I go make dem fear mi with all dia heart, so dat dem nor go turn leave mi again.
I go happy to do good tins for dem and I go plant dem for dis land forever.
“ ‘ “Just as I bring dis wahala for dem, na so too I go give dem all di good tins wey I don promise dem.
Una dey sey di land go bi like desert where pipol or animals nor go dey again. Dem still sey dem go give di land to Babilon pipol. But my pipol go buy field for dis land again.
Pipol go buy dia land and dem go sign di agriment, gum-am and pipol go witness am. Dis tins go happen for Benjamin land; di village wey dey round Jerusalem; all Judah town and for di towns wey dey di kountries for hill with all di land under di hill for Judah sout. I go bring di pipol kom back to dia land. Mi, wey bi God, don tok.” ’ ”
