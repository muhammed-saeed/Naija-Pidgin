So as I sidan dey tink dis tins make I for undastand dem, I kon si sey, na God dey kontrol evritin wey raitious and wise pipol dey do. Even doh wi like or hate anytin, nobody know wetin go happen for future.
Weda wi dey raitious or wiked; good or bad; dey klean or not; dey offa sakrifice or not, na di same tin go happen to all of us, bikos pesin wey good nor betta pass sina and pipol wey dey make promise give God, nor betta pass doz wey nor dey make.
Dis na di bad part about evritin wey dey happen for dis world: na di same tin go happen to evribody. Plus dis sef, na wikedness full human being mind and na wetin dem like dem dey do, den one day, dem go die.
But doz wey dey alive get hope, bikos dog wey dey alive, betta pass lion wey don die!
Pipol wey dey alive naw, know sey one day dem go die, but pipol wey don die, nor know anytin and dem nor get any reward again; pipol nor dey remember dem again.
Evritin wey dem do wen dem still dey alive, weda dem love, hate or bin dey jealous pesin, all don die follow dem go. Dem nor get part for anytin wey dey happen for dis world again.
So, make wi kontinue to chop with joy and drink with happiness for awa heart, bikos God don already asept awa work.
Make wi always let awa klot dey klean and spray betta perfume for body!
So as far as wi dey live dis yuzles life wey God give us, make wi enjoy am with awa wife, bikos dat na awa reward for all di trobol wey wi dey face for dis world.
So, anytin wey yu dey do, make yu do am well, bikos wons yu die, yor wisdom, knowledge, work and plans, nor go mean anytin again.
I don still notis anoda tin for dis world sey; nor bi who run pass dey always win di race and nor bi di sojas wey strong pass, dey always win di war. Wise pipol dey hongry sometaims and just as pipol wey dey work hard nor dey always get money, na so too pipol wey know book nor dey always get betta life. All dis tins dey happen by shance, as long as yu dey di rite place for di rite time.
True-true, nobody know di time wen dis tins go happen! Like fish wey net katch or bird wey enter trap, na so too, wahala just dey kom meet pipol by sopraiz.
Dis na anoda tin wey I don si about wisdom and I like am, bikos of di way tins dey happen for dis world.
E get one town and di pipol wey dey inside nor many. Den one king wey get pawa well-well bring en sojas kon attack dem.
But one poor wise man for der, know wetin to do, so dat di town go dey save. So e do am kon save evribody. But afta, nobody tink am for dia heart sey, make dem tank di man.
So I kon si sey, wisdom betta pass pawa, but nobody go respet wise man wey poor; nobody go gri listin to en advise bikos e nor get money.
Wise pipol nor dey shaut wen dem dey tok and dis betta pass king wey dey shaut and tok to fools.
So wisdom dey good pass swod, but one sin fit distroy many-many good tins.
