Korah Shidren Song For Di Kwayamasta
My Oga God wey dey save mi. For day time, I dey kry give Yu and I still dey pray to Yu for nite.
Abeg, make Yu hear my prayer; make Yu listin to mi as I dey kry,
bikos na so-so trobol full my life and deat don near mi well-well.
I don already bi like pesin wey don die; like strong man wey nor get pawa again.
I bi like who dey among dead body and I sleep like sey I dey grave. Yu don forget mi and Yu nor kare for mi again.
Yu don trow mi enter deep pit kon keep mi for di place wey dark well-well.
Yor vexnashon dey press mi and yor waves don kover mi.
Yu don porshu my friends kon fool mi for dia front and naw, I dey for trap wey I nor go fit run komot.
My own tears don blind my eyes. My God, evriday I dey beg make Yu kom help mi; I lift my hand to Yu make Yu sorry for mi.
All di wonderful tins wey Yu dey do nor mean anytin to pipol wey don die. Abi dead body go fit raiz-up kon praiz Yu?
Pipol wey dey grave go fit tok about yor love wey nor dey fail? For where dem dey naw, dem go fit tok about how Yu good rish?
Darkness go fit tok about di wonderful tins wey Yu do? Dead body go fit tok about di good-good tins wey Yu dey do?
My God, I dey kry give Yu and I go kontinue to beg Yu evriday by day.
So, my God, wetin make Yu rijet mi? Wetin make Yu turn yor face from mi?
Na since wen I dey small Yu allow pipol dey opress mi and I don nearly die. Yu don ponish mi well-well and naw, na pains full my life.
Di way Yu dey vex, dey make mi sopraiz. Yes! Yor vexnashon don distroy mi finish.
Evriday, pipol gada round mi like wota kon join togeda dey opress mi.
Yu don allow pipol wey I love and doz wey love mi, dey run from mi. So, na darkness bi my best friend naw.
