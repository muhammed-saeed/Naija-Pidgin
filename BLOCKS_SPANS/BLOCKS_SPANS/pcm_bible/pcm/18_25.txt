Bildad kon sey:
“Na God get pawa pass. E keep en kingdom wey dey heaven for peace.
Anybody fit kount di angels? Abi e get where God lite nor dey shine rish?
Anybody fit dey klean before God? How yu wey woman born won take dey pure?
For God eye, even di moon nor brite and di stars nor shine rish.
Tok-less of human being wey just bi like worm and magot! Wetin dia life mean to God?”
