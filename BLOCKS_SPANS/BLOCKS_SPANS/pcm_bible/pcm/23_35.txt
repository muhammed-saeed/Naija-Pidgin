Make di desert and doz dry aria, happy. Make di wildaness happy kon grow well like lily flower!
Di desert go sing and shaut bikos e dey happy; e go fine like Lebanon mountins. Di soil go dey good like Sharon and Karmel farms. Evribody go si God glory, en greatness and pawa.
Di hands and legs wey don taya, make una make dem strong.
Make una tell evribody wey nor get hope sey, “Make yu dey strong, nor fear at-all! God dey kom save yu and E go ponish yor enemies.”
Den blind eyes go open and doz wey nor dey hear, go hear word.
Pipol wey nor fit waka, go stand up dance and pipol wey nor fit tok, go dey shaut with happiness. River go dey flow kom from all di desert;
di hot groun go turn to lake and wota go kover all di dry land. Where wiked dogs bin dey stay, grass, reeds and straw go grow full der.
One fine road go dey der and dem go koll am, “Holiness Road.” No sina go travel pass dat road and foolish pipol nor go fit deceive doz wey dey waka pass der.
No lion go dey der and wild animals nor go pass dat place. Na di pipol wey God don save, go pass dat road.
Dem go dey happy, dey sing and shaut with joy till dem rish Jerusalem. Dem go dey happy forever and dem go dey free from sorrow and pain.
