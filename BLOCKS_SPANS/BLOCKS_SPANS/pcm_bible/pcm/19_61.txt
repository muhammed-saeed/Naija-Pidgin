For Di Kwayamasta. Akordin to Shushan-edut style. David prayer to take tish odas. E rite am wen e dey fight with Aram Naharaim and Aram Zobah. Dat na wen Joab turn back kon kill 12,000 sojas from Edom for Salt Valley.
My God, Yu don rijet and skata awa defence, bikos Yu dey vex for us. But naw, make Yu kom favor us again.
Yu shake di eart kon tear am into two. So, make Yu join where divide, bikos di eart don dey fall.
Yu dey trit us with strong hand kon make us drink wine wey dey katch us naw.
But Yu don give one banner to pipol wey dey fear Yu, so dat dem go dey save wen enemies attack dem.
Naw, make Yu save yor pipol wey Yu love. Make Yu ansa kon save us with yor pawa.
God don tok from en holy place sey, “I go defeat di pipol kon divide Shekem land with joy, den I go measure Sukkot Valley.
Na mi get Gilead and Manasseh! Efraim wey I dey wear like helmet for head, go produce strong sojas and Judah wey I dey wear for body like war klot, go produce kings.
But Moab wey I dey use as my wosh-hand basin, go bi my savant and I go use Edom take klean my legs kon happy, bikos I don win Filistia pipol.”
So, who go take mi enter di strong town? Who go fit help mi win Edom pipol?
My God, Yu don rijet us? Yu nor go follow awa sojas go war again?
Abeg, make Yu help us fight awa enemies, bikos human being help dey yuzles.
But with awa God help, wi go get viktory, bikos E go help us mash awa enemies for groun kon win dem.
