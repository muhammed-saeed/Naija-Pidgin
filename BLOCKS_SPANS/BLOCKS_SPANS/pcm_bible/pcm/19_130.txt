Solomon Song
Make Israel pipol sey, “Na since wi dey small awa enemies don dey opress us.
Even doh enemies dey attack us since wi dey small kom rish naw, dem neva ever fit win us.
Dem don use cutlass kut all awa back like sey na farmer klear am.
But God dey good; E don kut di rope wey wiked pipol take tie us and naw, wi don dey free.
So, make evribody wey hate Jerusalem, turn back with shame.
Make dem dey yuzles like grass wey dey on-top roof, wey go die as e dey grow
and pipol nor go plok or si am again.
Yes! Pipol wey dey waka pass nor go sey, ‘Make Oga God bless dem’ or sey, ‘Wi bless una with Oga God name.’ ”
