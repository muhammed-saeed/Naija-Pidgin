I tell mysef, “Make yu go enjoy yorsef, so dat yu go know wetin happiness bi” But I kon si sey, dat one too, dey yuzles.
I still si sey, “E dey foolish to dey laf anyhow and to dey find enjoyment waka, nor dey make pesin get any betta tin!”
I really tink well-well about wetin wine go fit do for mi. I bilive sey na wisdom I dey use and I nor go bihave like fool, so dat I go know wetin dey good for pipol to do for dis world, as dem dey live dia life wey go soon end.
I make wetin I get plenty; build big-big house for mysef kon plant vineyards for evriwhere.
I design fine gardin and parks for mysef kon plant difren-difren fruits for der.
I dig where wota go for dey flow for di gardin, so dat di tree dem go grow well.
I hire both men and wimen savant and I still get savants wey dem born for my house. My animal and di pipol wey dey kare for dem, many pass any of di kings own wey don rule for Jerusalem before naw.
Silva, golds and oda good tins wey I karry from oda kings and nashons, I still save dem for mysef. I hire good singas, both men and wimen and I get many fine-fine girl-friends. Yes! I get evritin wey suppose make man happy!
So I get money and propaty pass all di kings wey don rule Jerusalem before mi, plus all dis tins, I still get betta wisdom.
I dey get anytin wey I wont and I nor stop mysef from anytin wey go make mi happy. I dey proud for evritin wey I don work for and na all dis, bi my reward.
But as I sidan dey tink of evritin wey I don do, I si sey all of dem dey yuzles. Dem bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze! E nor really get anytin wey pesin fit gain for dis world.
So I kon sey, make I try know di difrence between wisdom and foolishness. Abi e get anytin wey who take-ova from mi won do, wey I nor do before.
I don si sey, just as lite betta pass darkness, na so too, to know sometin, betta pass foolishness.
Wise pipol dey si where dem dey go, but foolish pipol dey waka fall for darkness. But I still si sey, both wise and foolish pipol dey sofa di same tins.
So I tell mysef, “Na wetin go happen to fools, go still happen to mi! Both of us go still die! So wetin I kon gain with all dis wisdom wey I get?” So I kry kon tell mysef, “E nor get any good tin wey wisdom dey give!”
Bikos both wise and foolish man, go die and time dey kom wen dem nor go remember di wise pesin just as dem nor go remember di foolish pesin again! So one day, pipol go forget di two of dem.
So, I hate dis life, bikos evritin wey dey inside, dey give trobol. Evritin dey yuzles and e bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze.
I hate all di hard work wey I don do for dis world, bikos evritin wey I don sofa for, I go die leave dem for anoda pesin to enjoy.
And who go fit know weda di one wey go kom afta mi go dey wise or foolish? But dem go kontrol evritin wey I work for, for dis world! So, make una si as evritin dey yuzles!
So I kon regret sey, I too work hard for dis world.
Some pipol work with wisdom; with wetin dem know and with dia skill; but dem go still die leave evritin for anoda pesin wey nor work at-all. Dis tins dey yuzles and nor dey good at-all.
So wetin pipol go gain for dis life afta all dia hard work and trobol?
As far as yu dey alive, evritin wey yu dey do, nor dey bring anytin escept pain and trobol and yu nor go even fit rest well for nite. All dis tins dey yuzles!
So I kon sey, nor-tin dey good dan for pesin to chop, drink and enjoy di work wey e dey do, bikos all dis enjoyment kom from God.
Bikos nobody go fit chop, drink and enjoy anytin, escept na God gi-am.
God dey give wisdom, knowledge and joy to pipol wey dey do wetin E wont. But if pesin wey dey sin get money and propaty well-well, God go take dem from am kon gi-am to pesin wey dey do wetin E wont. All dis tins dey yuzles too and dem bi like wen pesin dey porshu breeze.
