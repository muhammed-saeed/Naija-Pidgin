“Babilon, kom down from yor throne and sidan for groun! Bikos from naw go, nobody go ever sey yu dey soft and tenda again.
Karry grindin stone kon bigin grind korn! Remove di klot wey yu take kover face and pul yor fine klot komot, den make yu pak yor skirt up as yu dey cross di river!
Pipol go si yor nakednes and shame go katch yu well-well, bikos I go revensh and I nor go sorry for yu.”
Awa Savior – di Oga God wey dey lead heaven sojas, naim bi en name; di Holy One for Israel.
“Babilon, sidan for darkness and make yu kwayet, bikos pipol nor go koll yu kween again!
I bin dey vex for my pipol and na dat make mi allow yu attack dem; but yu nor sorry for dem at-all and yu even dey ponish di old pipol among dem.
Yu sey, ‘I go bi kween forever.’ But yu nor tink about dis tins or tink about wetin go happen.
Naw, make yu listin, yu wey dey enjoy yorsef kon tink sey yu dey save and sikure. Yu tell yorsef sey, ‘I too mush and nobody bi like mi. My husband or shidren nor go ever die.’
But dis tins go happen to yu at wons; yor shidren and husband go die for di same day and yor majik nor go fit help yu.
Yu trust yor wikedness kon sey, ‘Nobody dey si mi.’ Yor wisdom and di sense wey yu get dey deceive yu wen yu sey, ‘I dey special and nobody bi like mi.’
So, wahala go kom meet yu and yor majik nor go fit help yu. Wahala wey yu nor espect, go happen to yu at wons! Even trobol wey yu nor tink of, go rush kom meet yu like wota.
Naw, make yu dey use yor majik well-well; majik wey yu dey use since dem born yu. May bi e fit help yu or yu fit use am porshu trobol!
Even all di many advise wey dem advise yu don make yu weak well-well. Yor pipol wey dey read di star and doz wey dey tok as weda go bi, make dem kom out kon save yu from wetin go soon happen to yu.
Si! Dem bi like grass wey fire burn trowey! Dem nor even fit save demsef, from di fire wey too hot for dem. Wen di weda kold, dem nor get fire to take warm demsef or di one dem go sidan near.
All yor friends wey use dey do business with since yu bi small pikin, go turn leave yu and nobody go kom help yu.”
