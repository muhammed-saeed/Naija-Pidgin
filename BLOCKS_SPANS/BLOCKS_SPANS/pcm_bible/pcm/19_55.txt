David Song For Di Kwayamasta Wen Zif Pipol Go Ripot Am
My God, make Yu kom with yor great pawa kon save mi! Make Yu defend mi with yor strent.
My God, make Yu listin to my prayers. Make Yu listin to mi as I dey beg.
Bikos strenjas dey attack mi; wiked pipol dey try to kill mi and dem nor kare about God.
But na God dey help mi. Na God dey keep my life!
Make evry wiked plan wey my enemies dey plan, turn back go meet dem.
I go just give Yu sakrifice on my own! My Oga God, I go praiz yor name, bikos e dey good and
Yu save mi from my trobols kon help mi defeat my enemies.
