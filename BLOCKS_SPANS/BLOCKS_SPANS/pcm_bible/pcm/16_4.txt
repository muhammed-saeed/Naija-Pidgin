Wen Sanballat hear sey, wi Jew pipol don start to dey build di wall, e kon dey vex and laf us.
For en friends and Samaria pipol front, e kon sey, “Wetin dis yeye Jew pipol tink sey dem dey do? Dem one build di town again? Dem tink sey, na to offa sakrifice dem go take build di town finish one day? Dem go fit make stones from di ashes of di tins wey fire burn?”
Tobaya wey kom from Ammon stand near am kon sey, “Even fit fox waka on-top di wall wey dem build, na wons di wall go fall rish groun!”
Den I pray, “My Oga God! Make Yu hear as dem dey laf us. Make dia laf and disgrace fall for dia own head. Make dem tif all di propaty wey dem get kon karry dem as prisonas go strenj land.
Make Yu nor forgive di bad-bad tins wey dem do and nor forget dia sins, bikos dem don curse us wey dey build.”
So, wi kon kontinue to dey build di wall and bikos di pipol dey ready to work, wi kon almost build am rish half of how e high rish before.
Sanballat, Tobaya with Arab, Ammon and Ashdod pipol kon dey vex well-well wen dem hear sey wi still dey ribuild Jerusalem wall and kover all di holes wey dey.
So, dem plan to attack and kause wahala for Jerusalem.
But wi pray give awa God kon put men wey go dey guide di place both day and nite.
Judah pipol get one song wey dem dey sing: “Doz wey dey work, dia pawa don fail! Di trobol too mush and bikos of dat, wi nor fit ribuild di wall.”
Awa enemies still sey, “Before dem go si or know wetin dey happen, wi don attack, kill and kause wahala for dem!”
So from time to time, Jew pipol wey dey stay among awa enemies, dey kom tell us di plan wey di enemies dey plan.
So I give di pipol swod, bow and arrow kon put some pipol for back of di walls and some for open space.
I si sey di pipol dey worry, so I kon tell dem, dia ofisas and dia leaders sey, “Make una nor fear awa enemies. Make una remember how great and mighty God bi, den make una fight for una brodas, shidren, wifes and una house.”
Awa enemies hear sey wi don know di plan wey dem dey plan against us and dem know sey God don make dia plan fail. Den all of us kon go start to build again.
From den go, half among my men dey work and half dey guide, dem wear war klot and hold spears, shields and bows. And di leaders really support di pipol
wey dey ribuild di wall. Even doz wey dey karry di tins wey dem take dey work, dey karry am with one hand kon hold swod for di oda hand
and evribody wey dey build, hang swod for dia waist. Di man wey go blow di trumpet as signal stand near mi.
I tell di pipol and dia ofisas, “Where wi dey work big well-well naim make us dey far from each oda for di wall.
So if una hear di trumpet nois, make una gada round mi and awa God go fight for us.”
So half dey work from morning go rish nite evriday, while di oda half dey guide.
By dis time, I tell di leaders sey dem and di pipol wey dey help dem, must stay for Jerusalem for nite, so dat wi go fit guide di town for nite and work for day time.
For dis time, mi, doz wey dey follow mi, my savant and my bodyguards, nor dey shange klot at-all. And all of us keep awa swod, bow and arrow for where wi go kwik take am even fit na wota wi dey drink.
