How I wish Yu go tear di sky open kon kom down from heaven! Di mountins go si Yu kon shake with fear.
Dem go dey shake like wota wey dey boil for hot fire. Make Yu kom show yor pawa to yor enemies, so dat di nashons go fear wen dem si Yu,
bikos wen Yu do tins wey wi nor espect; wen Yu kom down, di pipol kon dey fear. Wen di mountins si Yu, dem bigin shake dey fear.
Nobody don si or hear about any oda god wey bi like Yu or di one wey fit do di kind tins wey Yu dey do for doz wey put dia hope on Yu.
Yu dey help pipol wey dey do wetin dey rite; pipol wey remember how Yu wont make dem dey live dia life. But wen wi kontinue to dey kommit sin, Yu vex for us. So na how wi wont make Yu take save us?
All of us nor dey klean and dirty full awa life. Bikos of awa sins, wi bi like leaf wey don fade wey breeze dey blow trowey.
Nobody dey pray to Yu again; nobody dey kom meet Yu for help again. Yu don hide yorsef and abandon us, bikos of awa sins.
But Oga God, na Yu bi awa papa. Wi bi klay and na Yu mold us. Na Yu kreate us,
so make Yu nor too vex for us or use awa sins against us forever. Wi bi yor pipol, so make Yu sorry for us.
Yor holy towns bi like desert na; Jerusalem na desert wey don skata
and awa temple wey holy and fine, wey awa grand-grand papa dem for dey praiz Yu before, don skata and dem distroy am with fire. Evriwhere wey wi love, don skata.
So Oga God, all dis tins nor koncern Yu at-all? Yu nor won do anytin? Yu won make wi sofa pass as wi fit bear?
