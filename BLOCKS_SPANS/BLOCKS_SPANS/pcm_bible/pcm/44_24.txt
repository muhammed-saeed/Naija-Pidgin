Oga God Felix, wi dey si all dis tins wey yu dey do for evriwhere. Na evriday wi dey tok about am and dey tank yu.
But make my story for nor long too mush, Abeg make yu hear us well-well as yu dey always do.
Bikos wi don si dis man sey e find trobol and kause wahala among all di Jew pipol for di world and naim dey lead di gang wey dem dey koll, ‘Di Nazarenes’.
E even take Greek pipol enter di temple, so wi kon arrest am.
But Lysias, di kommanding offisa kon take am komot from awa hand with force.
So wen yu ask am kweshon, yu go fit hear by yorsef all di tins wey wi sey e do.”
As e dey tok, di Jew pipol too dey support sey, wetin e tok, na true.
Wen di govnor sey make Paul tok, e kon sey, “I know sey yu don bi judge for dis kountry for many years naw, so I nor go fear dey tok as I dey defend mysef.
As yu go fit shek for yorsef, e neva pass twelf days naw wey I go Jerusalem go woship.
Dem nor si mi dey argue with anybody or dey gada crowd for di temple varanda or inside di sinagog or even for di whole town,

But I go let yu know sey I dey woship di God wey awa grand-grand papa dem dey woship, as dia tradishon tok (wey dis pipol sey na one kind gang). Dem bilive evritin wey di law tok and wey di profets rite down.
I get hope for God (di kind one wey dis men get too) sey one day, pipol wey don die, weda na bad or good pipol, go wake- up.
Na bikos of dis I dey always try my best to get klean belle for God and pipol front.

Dis na wetin I dey do wen dem si mi for di temple; I dey klean and I nor gada any crowd or disturb anybody.
But some Jew from Asia suppose dey here dey tok di tin wey dem get against mi, if dem get anytin to tok at-all.
Or make dis men wey dey here tok di crime wey I kommit as I face di kansol,
bikos if e pass dis one, I go shaut as I stand for dia front sey, ‘Una dey judge mi today, bikos I bilive sey pipol wey don die, go wake-up.’ ”
Den Felix, wey bi sey e know di true story about di Way, pospone di kase kon sey, “Wen Lysias, di kommanding offisa kom, I go judge yor kase.”
E kon orda di soja oga make e guide Paul, but make e gi-am small freedom and make e nor drive en friends if dem won gi-am anytin.
