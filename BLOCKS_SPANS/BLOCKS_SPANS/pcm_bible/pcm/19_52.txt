David Song For Di Kwayamasta Afta E Sleep With Batsheba
My God, make Yu sorry for mi, bikos of yor love where nor dey fail. Make Yu forgive mi my sins, bikos Yu dey sorry for pipol.
Make Yu wosh and klean mi from di bad tins wey I do. Klean mi from all my sins.
I know sey I do many bad tins; bikos I really know all di sins wey I dey kommit.
I don really sin against Yu; I don do bad tins for yor present. Evritin wey Yu dey tok dey rite and di way Yu take judge my kase, dey good.
Si, na for inside sin, dem born mi; Yes! Na rite from di time wey my mama get my belle.
But even before dem born mi, Yu don plan betta tins for mi kon dey tish mi wisdom.
So make Yu klean mi from my sins and I go dey klean; make Yu wosh mi and I go white pass snow.
My God, make Yu give mi my joy back and make my bones wey Yu break, strong again.
Make Yu nor kontinue to dey look my sins, but klean mi from all di bad tins wey I don do.
My God, make Yu put betta heart inside mi and make yor spirit strong inside mi too.
Nor drive mi komot from yor present or take yor holy spirit from mi.
Make Yu give mi back di joy wey make mi dey save, so dat I go dey happy to obey Yu.
Den I go tish wiked pipol yor ways and dem go turn kom meet Yu.
My God wey dey save pesin, make Yu forgive mi, bikos I don kill pesin; den I go sing about yor forgivenes with joy.
My God, make Yu open my lips, so dat my mout go praiz Yu.
Nor bi sakrifice or burnt ofrin yu wont, if not, I for offa sometin give Yu.
Di sakrifice wey Yu wont, na spirit wey dey honbol and dey obey Yu. My God, Yu nor go rijet pesin wey honbol and turn from en sin kom meet Yu.
My God, make Yu look Zion with favor kon help am; make Yu ribuild Jerusalem walls again.
Den Yu go asept di sakrifice wey dem go offa with betta spirit; di burnt and di full ofrins. Den pipol go offa melu as sakrifice, for yor altar again.
