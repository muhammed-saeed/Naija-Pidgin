Fine woman! Make yu si as yor leg fine for inside sandal. Yor lap round like gold wey betta goldsmit make.
Yor pompu round like cup wey full with wine wey dem mix. Yor belle bi like many korn seed wey lily gada round.
Yor two breast bi like gazelle or deer wey bi twins.
Yor neck fine just like ivory towa and yor eyes bi like Heshbon Pool wey dey shine near Bat-Rabbim Gate. Yor nose fine like Lebanon towa wey face Damaskus.
Yor head fine like Mount Karmel. Yor hair dey shine like design wey dey di king garment. Di wey e fine, dey sopraiz di king well-well.
So my love, make yu si as yu fine rish! Yes! Yu too fine; si as love make yu komplete well-well.
Yu slim like palm tree and yor breast bi like palm fruit.
I sey, “I go klimb di tree kon plok en fruit. To mi, yor breast bi like grape and di smell from yor nose, dey scent like apple.”
So make yor mout taste like di wine wey good pass, wey go flow small-small enter awa lips wen wi dey sleep togeda.

Di mandrake fruit and di fruit wey fine pass, dey give us sweet smell. My darlin, difren kind of good tins dey awa door-mot and I don keep both old and new wons for yu.
