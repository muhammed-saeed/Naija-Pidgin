For di last days, seven wimen go hold one man kon sey, “Wi go feed and buy klot for awasef, but make yu just let us koll yu awa husband, so dat pipol nor go laf us, bikos wi nor get husband.”
For dat time, God go make evry plant and tree grow big and fine well-well again. All di pipol wey go survive for Israel, go like di tins wey di land go produce.
Den doz wey God save wey go remain for Jerusalem, pipol go koll dem, “holy pipol.”
God go use en pawa take judge and make di nashons holy. E go forgive Jerusalem pipol dia sins kon klean di land bikos of pipol wey dem kill for der.
Den God go kover and guide Mount Zion with all di pipol wey gada der with kloud for day time and fire for nite. Yes! God glory go kover and protet di whole town.
For day time, God glory go kover di town from strong heat kon protet am from heavy rain.
