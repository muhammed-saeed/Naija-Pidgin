Solomon Song
My God, I dey kry kom meet Yu with pain for my heart.
My Oga God, make Yu listin and hear mi as I dey kry for mesi!
If to sey Yu, my God won kount all di sins wey pesin kommit, den na who go fit stand before Yu?
But Yu always dey ready to forgive so dat dem go honor Yu.
So, I put my hope for God hand, I trust am with my whole life and I dey wait for en word wey nor dey fail.
Di way I dey find God, sirious pass as gateman dey wait make day break. Yes o-o, e sirious pass as gateman dey do for morning.
So Israel pipol, make una put una hope for God hand, bikos God dey show en love and E always dey ready to save en pipol.
E go diliver Israel pipol from di wahala wey dem dey face, bikos of dia sins.
