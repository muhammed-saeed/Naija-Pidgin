David Song
My God, make Yu nor drive mi, bikos Yu dey vex. Nor ponish mi with yor vexnashon.
Make Yu sorry for mi, bikos I dey weak. Make Yu heal mi, bikos my bones dey shake.
I dey fear well-well. Na how e go tey rish, before Yu go kon save mi?
Make Yu kom back kon help mi. Save mi bikos of yor love wey nor dey fail.
Pesin wey don die, nor dey remember Yu. Na who go fit praiz Yu from inside grave?
I don taya to komplain, bikos evry nite, I dey wet my bed with wota from my eyes.
Sofa don make my eyes blind. My eyes dey weak, bikos of my enemies.
All of una wey dey do bad tins, make una leave mi alone, bikos God don hear my kry.
God don hear as I dey beg; E go ansa my prayers.
So make disgrace follow all my enemies and make dem dey fear well-well! Make dem run turn back, go hide with shame.
