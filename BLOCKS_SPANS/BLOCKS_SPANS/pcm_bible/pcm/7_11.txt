Wen dem komot from Egypt, dem travel pass di desert from di Red Sea till dem rish Kadesh.
Israel pipol send messenjas go meet Edom king sey, ‘Abeg make yu allow us pass yor land.’ But Edom king nor gri. Dem still tell Moab king di same tin, but e nor gri too. Den Israel pipol kon stay for Kadesh.

Yu fit take anytin wey Kemosh yor god give yu, but wi go take all di land wey di Oga awa God give us.
Yu tink sey yu betta pass Balak, Zippor pikin wey bi Moab king? E try to shalenge Israel pipol, abi e nor do am? E nor ever fit fight us.
For three hundred years naw, Israel pipol dey stay for Heshbon and di towns wey dey near am; Aroer and di towns wey dey near am and di oda town wey dey Arnon! Why yu nor kom klaim di land, dat time?
I neva do yu any bad tin, but naw, yu dey do mi bad as yu kom attack mi. Make God wey dey judge, judge today between Israel and Ammon pipol!”
But Ammon king, nor listin to Jeftah message.
Dat time, God Spirit dey with Jeftah and e kon go Gilead and Manasseh town. E lead en sojas from Mizpa wey dey Jabesh-Gilead, go fight Ammon pipol.
Jeftah make vow give God sey, “If Yu make mi win Ammon pipol,
anytin wey go first kom out from my house kom welkom mi, I go sakrifice am as burn ofrin give Yu.”
So, Jeftah lead en sojas go fight Ammon pipol and God gi-am viktory.
E kill Ammon pipol kon distroy about twenty towns, from Aroer go rish one aria wey near Minnit till e distroy rish Abel-Keramin. Na like dis Israel pipol take win Ammon pipol.

But first allow mi go do dis one tin: Allow mi go on-top di hill go roll and kry with my friends for two mont first, bikos I go die as virgin.”
