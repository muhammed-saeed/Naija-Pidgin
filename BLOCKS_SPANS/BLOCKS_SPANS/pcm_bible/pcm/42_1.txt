For di time wen Herod bi King for Judea, one priest dey wey en name na Zekaraya from Abijah family and en wife name na Elizabet, wey kom from Aaron family.
Dem dey do wetin God like, dey follow all di tins wey God tok for en word.
Dem nor get pikin, bikos Elizabet nor fit get belle and dem don old well-well.
E kom rish Zekaraya family turn to do priest work for di temple
and as dia custom bi, dem kon choose Zekaraya make e enter inside God Temple go burn incense.
Wen di time to burn incense don rish, all di pipol kon gada for outside dey pray.

As Zekaraya si di angel, fear katch am well-well and e kon dey shake.
But di angel tell am, “Make yu nor fear Zekaraya, bikos God don hear yor prayer. Yor wife Elizabet go born boy pikin for yu and yu go koll am, ‘John.’

Di angel ansa, “I bi Gabriel, wey dey stand for God present and na-im send mi kom tell yu dis Good News.
But since yu nor bilive wetin I tok so, yu nor go fit tok again, until di day wen dis tins go happen.”
So di pipol wey dey wait for Zekaraya kon bigin wonder why e stay tey inside di temple.
Wen e kom outside, e nor fit tok again. Dem kon know sey e don si vishon for inside di temple, bikos e use hand take make sign for dem.
