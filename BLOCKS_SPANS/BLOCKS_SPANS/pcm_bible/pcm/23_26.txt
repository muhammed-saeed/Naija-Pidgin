For day time, pipol go sing dis song for Judah land: “Awa town dey strong well-well! God ensef dey defend awa wall and na-im dey make us strong!
Make una open di town gates, so dat di nashon wey dey faithful; wey en pipol dey do wetin dey rite, go fit enter.
Oga God, Yu dey guide and save pipol wey dey faithful, bikos dem trust Yu.
Make wi always dey trust God and E go protet us forever.
True-true, pipol wey dey karry body up, God dey bring dem down. E dey distroy and skata towns wey tink sey dem too strong. Yes, E dey trow dem for dust.
Pipol wey dem dey opress before, dey mash dem pass naw. Yes, poor pipol dey waka on-top dem naw.
Raitious pipol dey live korrect and good life and dia ways dey-dey strait.
My Oga God! Wi dey wait for Yu as Yu dey judge us. Yes! Na yor greatness and as Yu dey do yor tins, dey make us grow.
I look for Yu for nite, my spirit dey find Yu for morning, bikos wen Yu start to judge di world, den pipol for dis world go know and learn how to bihave well.
Even if Yu sorry for wiked pipol, dem nor go still learn how to do wetin dey rite and even for where raitious pipol dey rule, wiked pipol still dey do wiked tins; dem nor dey si God glory wey dey kom.
My God, even doh Yu don dey ready to ponish wiked pipol, dem nor still know sey Yu won ponish dem. Dem go si am and shame go katch dem wen dem si how Yu go take judge yor enemies for di world.
My God! Na Yu make us dey save and dey prosper and even evritin wey wi get, na Yu give us.
Oga God, difren-difren pipol don rule us, but na only Yu wi go dey praiz forever.
Dis pipol don die and dem nor go kom back again. Dia spirit nor go fit raiz-up again, bikos Yu don judge and distroy dem.
Yu don make awa nashon big well-well and Yu kon show how Yu strong rish. Yes! Yu don make awa land wide well-well.
God, wen wi dey pass thru pain, wi kry, pray and look for Yu, bikos of di way Yu dey ponish us.
Just as woman wey get belle dey kry and shaut with pain wen e won born, na so too wi dey kry from awa heart for Yu wey bi awa Oga God.
Instead make wi born pikin, na breeze awa pain born. Wi neva win anytin and wi nor get shidren wey go take-ova awa world.
God pipol wey don die, go kom back to life! Dia body go raiz-up again. So, all of una wey dey grave, make una wake-up kon shaut with happiness, bikos una go grow well like grass wey dew fall put and di eart go bring back evritin wey don die.”
My pipol! Make una dey go! Make una enter una house kon lock una door! Make una hide unasef until God don vex finish,
bikos God dey kom from where E dey stay for heaven kon ponish pipol bikos of dia sins. Di eart go show all di innocent pipol blood wey dem share on-top am and e nor go ever forget di innocent pipol wey dem kill.
