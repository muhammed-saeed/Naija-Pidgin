So God tell Moses, “Si, I don turn yu to god for Fero front and yor broda, Aaron go bi yor profet.
Yu go tell am all di tins wey I tell yu and yor broda Aaron go tell Fero sey e must free Israel pipol.
But I go make Fero heart strong, even with all di signs and wonders wey I go do take warn am.
Fero nor go gri listin to una. So I go ponish Egypt pipol. I go use force take karry my pipol Israel komot from Egypt land, den judge Egypt pipol well-well.
Den wen I show Egypt pipol as I strong rish kon take Israel pipol komot from der, di pipol go know sey na mi bi Oga God.”
So Moses and Aaron do as God kommand dem.
Naw, Moses na eighty years while Aaron na eighty-three years wen dem go tok to Fero.
God tell Moses and Aaron,
“Wen Fero sey, ‘Make una do sometin to make mi bilive!’ Den yu go tell Aaron, Trow di stik for groun for Fero front and e go shange to snake.”
Wen Moses and Aaron go meet Fero, dem do as God kommand dem. Aaron trow di stik for groun for where Fero and en savants dey and e shange to snake.
Fero sef tell en native doctors and juju-men for Egypt sey make dem do di same tin.
All of dem trow dia stik for groun and dia stik turn to plenty snake. But Aaron stik swallow all di oda stiks.
With all dis ones, Fero heart still strong well-well and e nor gri listin to dem, just as God tok.
God tell Moses, “Fero heart dey strong and sturbon and e nor go gri allow di pipol go.
So make yu prepare yorsef go meet am for morning wen e dey go River Nile korna and make yu hold di stik wey shange to snake for yor hand.
Den yu go tell am, ‘Na Oga God, wey bi Hibru pipol God send mi kom tell yu sey, “Make yu let my pipol go serve mi for di wildaness! But yu nor won gri.” ’
God sey, ‘Naw, wetin I go do, go make yu know sey na mi bi Oga God.’ Si, I go nak di wota for River Nile with di stik wey dey my hand and e go shange to blood.
Di fish dem for inside di river go die; di river go dey smell and di pipol wey dey Egypt nor go fit drink from di wota again.”
Den God tell Moses, “Tell Aaron sey, ‘Make yu stresh yor stik wey dey yor hand on- top di river, creek and pond dem for Egypt and dem go turn to blood; even di wota wey dey inside wood and stone kontaina.’ ”
Moses and Aaron do as Oga God kommand dem. Aaron use di rod wey dey en hand take nak River Nile for where Fero and en savants dey and di river turn to blood.
Wen all di fish dem inside di river don die, di river kon dey smell and Egypt pipol nor fit drink from di wota again.
But di juju-men for Egypt still do di same tin with dia juju pawa and dis tin kon make Fero heart strong more-more and e nor gri listin to Moses and Aaron, just as Oga God tell dem.
So Fero go inside en house back. E nor even allow wetin happen worry en mind.
All Egypt pipol bigin dig groun near River Nile, so dat dem go si wota drink, bikos dem nor fit drink di wota wey dey di river.
Naw, seven days don pass wen God turn River Nile to blood.
