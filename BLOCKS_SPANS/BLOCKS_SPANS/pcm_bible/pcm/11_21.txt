E get one vineyard wey dey near King Ahab palis for Jezrel and na Nabot get am.
One day, Ahab tell Nabot, “Make yu give mi yor vineyard wey dey near my palis, bikos I won use di land take do vegitabol farm. I go give yu anoda vineyard or pay yu betta prize for dis one.”
Nabot ansa, “I inherit dis vineyard from my grand-grand papa. God forbid sey I go give or sell am to yu!”
King Ahab kon dey vex and e nor happy with wetin Nabot tell am. E liedan face di wall for en bed and e nor gri chop.
Jezebel en wife go ask am, “Why yu dey vex like dis? Why yu nor gri chop?”
E ansa, “Na bikos of wetin Nabot tell mi. I sey make I buy en vineyard, or if e like, make I gi-am anoda one, but e nor gri!”
Jezebel ansa, “Nor bi yu bi di king? Make yu stand up from bed go chop. I go make sure sey yu take Nabot vineyard!”
Den Jezebel rite leta, sign am with Ahab name, use en seal take seal am kon send am go give di ofisas and doz wey bi leaders for Jezrel.
Di leta sey, “Make una kwik-kwik gada di pipol make dem fast and pray den make Nabot dia leader.
Make una arrange two jaguda make dem akuiz am sey, e curse God and di king. Den take am komot for di town kon stone am die.”
Di ofisas and di leaders for Jezrel kon do wetin Jezebel tok.
Dem choose one day to fast kon make Nabot di leader among di pipol.
Leta, di two jaguda kon akuiz Nabot sey, e curse God and di king, so dem take am go outside di town kon stone am die.
Dem send message go give Jezebel sey, “Dem don stone Nabot die.”
As Jezebel just si di message, e tell King Ahab, “Naw, Nabot don die. So make yu go take di vineyard wey e nor gri sell give yu.”
At wons, Ahab go di vineyard kon take-ova.
Den God tell Profet Elijah wey kom from Tishbe sey,
“Make yu go meet King Ahab for Samaria. Yu go si am for Nabot vineyard wey E take by force.
Make yu tell am, ‘Mi wey bi God sey, “Afta yu don kill pesin finish, yu won still take en propaty too?” ’ Still tell am sey, ‘Na for where dog for lick Nabot blood, na der too, dogs go for lick yor own blood!’ ”
Wen King Ahab si Elijah, e kon sey, “My enemy, yu don find mi si abi?” Elijah ansa, “Yes! I don find yu si. Yu don do wetin nor dey good at-all for God eye.
So God sey, ‘I go put wahala for yor head. I go kill yu and all di men for yor family; both yong and old ones.
Yor family go bi like King Jeroboam wey Nebat born and like Baasha wey bi Ahijah pikin. Bikos yu don make mi vex, as yu make Israel pipol dey sin.’
“And for Jezebel yor wife, God sey, ‘Na dogs go chop en body for Jezrel town.’
“Anybody for yor relashon wey die for di town, na dog go chop am and any one wey die for di open field, na vulture go chop am.”
(E nor get any oda pesin wey do dis kind bad tin for God present, like Ahab, just bikos of en wife Jezebel.
Na-im kommit di sin wey big pass, wen e go woship juju like Amor pipol wey God drive komot for di land, before Israel pipol kom.)
Wen Elijah tok finish, King Ahab tear en klot kon wear sak klot. E nor gri chop; e sleep with di sak klot and e kon dey sorry for ensef.
Den God tell Profet Elijah,
“Yu don si how King Ahab honbol ensef for mi since wen yu tell am wetin I tok? I nor go bring wahala kon gi-am wen e still dey life, but na en pikin go take head karry am.”
