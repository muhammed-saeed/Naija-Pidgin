Solomon kon love many wimen wey kom from oda kountry. Apart from Fero pikin wey bi en wife, e still marry plenty wimen from Hit, Moab, Ammon, Edom and Sidon kountries.
E marry dem, even doh God don kommand Israel pipol make dem nor marry from doz kountries, bikos dem go make Israel pipol woship oda gods.
Solomon marry 700 wife kon get 300 girl-friends and na dem make am turn en heart from God.
Wen Solomon don old, e kon stop to follow God, unlike David en papa wey follow God until e die.
E bigin woship Astarte wey bi Sidon pipol juju and Milkom, di yeye god wey Ammon pipol dey serve.
E sin and e nor woship God, just as en papa David woship am.
For di east side for Jerusalem hill, e build where dem for dey woship Kemosh, wey bi Moab pipol yeye god and Milkom, wey bi Ammon pipol god.
E still build where en oda wifes go for dey burn incense and offa sakrifice to dia gods.
Even doh di Oga wey bi God for Israel don appear to Solomon two times sey, “Make e stop to dey woship oda gods,”
Solomon nor obey God, instead, e turn from am. So, God bigin vex for Solomon
kon tell am, “Bikos yu know wetin yu dey do as yu dey break yor kovenant with mi and nor kon dey obey my kommand, I go take di kingdom from yu kon gi-am to one of yor ofisas.
But, bikos of David yor papa, I nor go do am wen yu still dey life, but e go happen wen yor pikin go dey rule.
But I nor go take di whole kingdom from am. Instead, I go leave one tribe for am bikos of David, my savant and bikos of Jerusalem, di town wey I dey stay.”
So God kon make Hadad wey dey di royal family for Edom, turn against Solomon.
Before dis tin happen; for di time wen David win Edom pipol, Joab wey bi en sojas kommander bin go beri dead body.
En and en men stay for Edom for six monts kon kill all di men wey dey Edom,
but na only Hadad with some of en papa savant wey bi Edom pipol, naim dem nor kill, bikos dem run go Egypt and dat time, Hadad still bi small pikin.
Hadad and di men wey karry am run kon from Midian go Paran, where oda men for join dem. Den, dem travel go Egypt and Egypt king kon give Hadad some land, house and food.
Hadad kon bi di king friend, so di king gi-am en wife sista, make e marry. (Di king wife name na Tahpanhes.)
Hadad wife born boy, so e name am, “Genubat”, but na di kween kare for am for di palis and e stay with di king shidren.
Wen Hadad hear for Egypt sey King David and Joab en soja kommander don die, Hadad kon tell di king, “Make I kon dey go back to my own kountry.”
Di king ask am, “Why yu won go? E get anytin wey yu wont, wey I nor give yu? Wetin make yu won go yor kountry back?” Hadad ansa, “Abeg, my king, make I just go,” So e kon go back to en kountry.
God still make Rezon wey bi Eliada pikin, turn against Solomon. Rezon run from en oga, King Hadadeza for Zobah
kon bi leader to some pipol wey nor dey respet di law. (Dis tin happen afta David don win King Hadadeza kon kill all di sojas for Siria.) Rezon and en men go stay for Damaskus where en men for make am Siria king.
Na Israel enemy e bi thru-out di time wey Solomon bi king.
Anoda man wey turn against King Solomon na Nebat pikin, Jeroboam, wey kom from Zaretan for Efraim tribe. En mama name na Zeruah, but en papa don die.
Dis na why e turn against King Solomon. King Solomon dey work for di land for di east side for Jerusalem and e dey ripair di town walls.
Jeroboam na very strong yong man, so wen King Solomon si as e dey work well-well, e kon sey make e look ova di pipol wey dey work for Manasseh and Efraim tribe aria.
One day wen Jeroboam dey travel from Jerusalem, Profet Ahijah for Shiloh kon meet only en for road, so
di profet remove di robe wey e wear, tear am into twelf pieces
kon tell Jeroboam, “Make yu take ten pieces for yorsef, bikos di Oga wey bi Israel pipol God, sey make I tell yu, ‘I go take di kingdom from Solomon kon give yu ten tribes.
Solomon go keep one, bikos of David my savant and Jerusalem, di town wey I choose as my own from all Israel land.
I go do dis tin, bikos Solomon rijet mi kon bigin woship oda gods. E dey woship Astarte wey bi Sidon juju; Kemosh wey bi Moab pipol god and Milkom, wey Ammon pipol dey serve. Solomon nor obey mi; e dey do bad tins and e nor keep my laws and kommand, just as David en papa keep am.
“ ‘But I nor go take all di kingdom from Solomon. I go make am rule till e die. Dis na wetin I go do, bikos of David my savant, wey I choose and e obey my laws and kommand.
I go take di kingdom from Solomon pikin kon give yu ten tribes,
but I go let Solomon pikin keep one tribe, so dat my savant David, shidren-shidren go fit dey rule for Jerusalem, di town wey I don choose sey dem go for woship mi.
Jeroboam; I go make yu king for Israel and yu go rule all di aria wey yu wont.
If yu obey and follow my laws and yu win my heart as yu dey obey my kommand, just as David my savant do, I go always dey with yu. I go make yu king for Israel and I go make sure sey yor shidren- shidren go rule afta yu, just as I do for David.
Bikos Solomon sin, I go ponish David shidren-shidren, but I nor go ponish dem forever.’ ”
So, Solomon kon try to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam run go meet King Shishak for Egypt kon stay der till Solomon die.
Evry oda tin wey Solomon do; en works and wisdom, dem rite dem for Solomon history book.
E rule Israel land from Jerusalem for forty years.
Solomon die and dem beri am for David Town and en pikin, Rehoboam kon take-ova as king.
