Zofar wey kom from Naamah kon tell Job:
“So nobody won ansa all dis nonsense wey yu dey tok? Na bikos yu too tok make yu feel sey yu dey rite?
Yu feel sey yu words nor go make mi tok? As yu dey tok to God as yu like, so nobody fit tell yu sey wetin yu dey do nor good?
Yu sey, ‘My tishing dey pure and I dey klean for God eye.’
But I wish sey God go just ansa and open en mout against yu.
E go show yu sey wisdom get many side. Wisdom nor bi simpol matter. God nor even ponish yu rish as yor sin many rish.
Yu fit find out where God from kom? Or how E take dey get en mighty and strong pawa?
God high pass di heavens; so wetin yu go fit do? E deep pass where dead body der; so wetin yu feel sey yu know?
God big pass di eart and E wide pass di sea.
If God arrest and put pesin for prison or karry am go kourt, na who won stop am?
God know pipol wey dey lie; E dey si all di sins wey dem dey kommit.
Pesin wey nor get sense, nor go fit wise unless donkey go fit born human being.
But for yu Job! Make yor heart dey rite before yu koll God.
If yu dey hide do wiked and bad tins, make yu stop am.
Na dat time yu go fit face di world without fear and yu go dey innocent.
Dat time all yor trobols go vanish like wota wey dey flow pass and dem nor go remember am again.
Yor life go shine pass aftanoon sun and di dark hours for life, go give yu morning lite.
Bikos wi get hope, yor life go dey well; God go protet and give yu rest.
Yu nor go fear yor enemies again and pipol go dey kom beg yu for help.
But wiked pipol eye go blind and dem nor go si where run go. Di only hope wey dem get, na make deat kom karry dem go.”
