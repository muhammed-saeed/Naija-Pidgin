Anytime Jesus dey prish, tax kollectors and sinnas dey kom listin to am.
But di Farisee pipol and di law tishas dey komplain sey, “Dis man dey follow sinnas chop.”
So, Jesus kon tell dem dis parabol:
“If yu get hundred sheep and one lost, yu nor go leave di ninty-nine wey remain go find dat one till yu si am?
Den wen yu si am, yu go karry am for shoulder, dey happy.
Wen yu rish house, yu go koll yor friends and neighbours sey, ‘Make una kom follow mi happy, bikos I don si my sheep wey lost before.’
I tell una true word, na so happiness dey for heaven wen one sina turn from sin kom meet God, pass ninty-nine good pipol wey don already dey with God.
“Or, if one woman get ten koins and one lost, wetin e go do? E nor go lite lamp, swip di whole house until e si am?
Wen e don si am, e go koll en friends and neighbours gada kon sey, ‘Make una kom follow mi happy, bikos I don si my money wey lost before.’
I tell una true word, na so God angels dey happy, wen one sina turn from sin kom meet God.”
Den Jesus sey, “One man dey wey get two sons.
Di yonga one kon tell en papa, ‘Give mi my own share for awa propaty.’ So en papa kon gi-am.
“Afta sometaim, di yong boy karry evritin wey e get travel go one far kountry kon waste all en money for yeye life.
Wen e don finish all wetin e get, e nor si anytin to chop, bikos honga dey for dat kountry, so e kon dey sofa.
E kon dey work for one man for der, di man dey send am go en farm go give pig food.
Di honga kon make am dey won chop di food wey di pig dem dey chop, bikos nobody gi-am food.
“But wen en eye klear, e kon sey, ‘All my papa workers get food wey dem nor fit chop finish, but hongry don nearly kill mi for here!
I go get up go meet my papa tell am, “Papa I don sin against heaven and against yu.
I nor rish make dem koll mi yor pikin again. Make yu take mi as yor worker.” ’
So e get up kon go meet en papa. “But wen en papa si am dey kom from far, e sorry for am, run go meet am, hold am near body kon kiss am.
“Den di pikin tell am, ‘Papa, I don sin against heaven and yu. I nor rish make dem koll mi yor pikin again. Make yu take mi as yor worker.’
“But di papa koll en savants kon tell dem, ‘Make una bring di best klot, ring and shoe and make una wear dem for my pikin.
Den, make una go take di melu wey fat pass, kill-am make wi do party,
bikos dis my pikin die before, but naw, e don kom back to life, e lost before, but naw, I don si am!’ So di party kon start.
“By dat time, di senior son dey kom from farm where e go work. Wen e don near house, e kon dey hear music and si pipol dey dance.
So e koll one savant kon ask am, ‘Wetin dey happen?’
Di savant ansa, ‘Yor broda don kom back and yor papa don kill di melu wey fat pass, bikos e kom back well and nor-tin bad happen to am.’
“Di senior broda kon dey vex and e nor gri enter house, so en papa kon beg am make e enter.
So, e tell en papa, ‘Si, all dis many years I dey work like slave for yu and e nor get anytime wey I disobey yu, but yu neva give mi even one small goat make I do party with my friends.
But wen dis yor pikin kom back afta e don waste all yor money with ashawo, yu kon kill di melu wey fat pass for am!’
“Den di papa tell am, ‘My pikin, yu always dey here with mi and evritin wey I get na yor own.
But e good make I do party, bikos yor broda die before, but naw, e don kom back to life, e lost before, but naw, wi don si am.’ ”
