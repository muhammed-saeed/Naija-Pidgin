For di twenty fourt day, for dat same mont, Israel pipol gada to fast, bikos of sins wey dem kommit.
Dem don already separate demsef from all di strenjas. Dem wear sak klot kon pak dust for dia head as sign sey dem dey sorry. Den dem kon stand dey konfess dia sins wey dem and dia grand-grand papa don kommit.
Dem read di Oga dia God law for dem for like three hour, den dem konfess dia sins kon woship di Oga dia God for di next three hours.

Na only Yu bi God. Na Yu kreate di heaven and di stars for sky. Yu kreate land, sea and evritin wey dey inside, den kon give dem life. All di pawa for heaven, dey bow woship Yu.
Na Yu, Oga God, choose Abram kon lead am komot from Ur for Kaldeans. Na Yu shange en name to Abraham.
Na bikos Yu si as e dey faithful rish, naim make Yu make kovenant with am. Yu promise to gi-am Kanaan, Hit, Amor, Periz, Jebus and Girgash pipol land. Di land wey en shidren-shidren go stay and Yu keep yor promise, bikos Yu dey faithful.
Yu si as awa grand-grand papa dem sofa for Egypt; Yu hear dem wen dem kry for help for di Red Sea.
Yu do wonderful mirakles against Egypt king, en ofisas and dia pipol, bikos Yu know as dem take opress yor pipol. Yu win and give yorsef name wey dem dey celebrate till today.
Yu divide di sea for yor pipol kon lead dem pass for dry groun. But Yu make di wota swallow di pipol wey dey porshu dem and dem kon sink like stone.
Yu lead yor pipol with kloud for day time and fire wey go dey give dem lite for nite.
Yu kom down from heaven kon tok to dem for Mount Sinai; Yu give dem betta judgement, laws, korrect tishings and kommands.
Yu tish dem sey make dem keep di Sabat Day holy kon give dem yor laws thru yor savant, Moses.
Wen dem dey hongry, Yu give dem bread from heaven and wen dem won drink wota, Yu give dem wota from rock. Yu tell dem sey make dem kontrol di land wey Yu promise to give dem.
But bikos of pride and sturbones, awa grand-grand papa dem nor gri obey yor kommand.
Dem nor gri obey; dem forget all wetin Yu don do; dem forget di mirakles wey Yu do and bikos of dia pride, dem choose leaders wey take dem go back to Egypt as slave. But Yu bi God wey dey forgive. Yu dey good and dey sorry for pesin. Yu nor dey kwik vex and yor royal love nor dey fail. Yu nor abandon dem at-all
even wen dem make juju wey bi like melu kon sey na di god wey lead dem komot from Egypt! Si as dem curse Yu rish!
Yet Yu nor still leave dem for inside desert, bikos yor mesi, dey great. Yu nor remove di kloud and fire wey dey show dem lite, both for day and nite.
Yu send yor good Spirit make e tell dem wetin dem go do and Yu nor stop to give dem manna chop and wota to drink.
For forty years for desert, Yu give dem all wetin dem nid; dem nor wear tear-tear klot and dia leg nor swell-up bikos of pain.
Yu make dem win nashons, kingdoms and lands wey dey near dia own. Dem win Heshbon land, wey Sihon dey rule and Bashan land wey Og for bi king.
Just as star many for sky, na so di shidren wey Yu give dem many and Yu let dem win and stay for di land wey Yu promise dia grand-grand papa sey Yu go give dem.
Dem win Kanaan land; Yu ova-take di pipol wey dey stay der. Yu give yor pipol pawa to do anytin wey dem like with Kanaan pipol and kings.
Yor pipol seize strong-strong towns; betta- betta land; house wey propaty full; well wey dem don dig; olive trees; fruit trees and vineyards. Dem chop anytin wey dem wont kon fat and dem enjoy all di good tins wey Yu give dem.
But with all dis tins, di pipol go against Yu. Dem nor gri obey Yu and dem turn from yor law. Dem kill di profets wey kom warn and tell dem to turn kom meet Yu. Dem curse Yu many-many times,
so Yu kon allow dia enemies win and rule dem. But wen dem koll Yu for help wen dem dey trobol, Yu ansa dem from heaven. Bikos of yor great mesi, Yu send leaders wey kom save dem from dia enemies.
Wen dem get peace, dem kon sin again and Yu allow dia enemies attack dem. But wen dem turn kom meet Yu for help, Yu hear dem from heaven and Yu save dem many-many times, bikos of yor mesi.
Yu warn dem sey make dem obey wetin Yu tish, but dem rijet yor law bikos of pride and even doh yor law dey give life, dem nor gri obey am, bikos of dia strong head and sturbones.
Bikos of yor love, Yu dey patient with dem for many years. Yu send yor Spirit wey warn dem thru di profets. But yet, dem nor gri listin! So Yu allow oda nashons attack dem again.
But bikos of yor great mesi, Yu nor distroy dem finish or abandon dem forever. Si as Yu dey good and dey show mesi!
Naw, awa God, di One wey dey great, get pawa and dey mighty, di Pesin wey dey keep en kovenant of love wey nor dey fail, make Yu help us as wi dey sofa. Bikos from di time wey Assyria kings first win us kom rish naw, na sofa wi dey sofa: wi and awa kings, leaders, priests, profets, grand-grand papa dem and all awa pipol.
Yu still dey rite even wen Yu ponish us. Wi really don sin well-well and Yu give us di ponishment wey fit us.
Awa grand-grand papa dem, awa kings, leaders and priests nor keep yor law at-all. Dem nor listin to yor kommands and laws.
Even wen dem get dia kingdom, dem nor gri serve Yu, doh Yu still show dem yor goodness. Yu give dem betta land to plant, yet dem nor gri turn from dia wikedness.
So today, wi bi slave for di land wey Yu give us. Di betta land where Yu give awa papa dem to chop from and enjoy as e good rish.
Di king wey Yu put ova us, bikos wi sin, na-im get evritin wey di land dey produce. Na wetin dem like dem dey do with wi and awa animals and wi really dey sofa for dia hand.
“Bikos of all wetin don happen, wi promise and rite agriment kon allow awa leaders, Levi pipol and di priests stamp am.”
