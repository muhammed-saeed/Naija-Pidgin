Etan Song
I go always dey sing about God love wey nor dey fail! Both yong and old pipol go hear about how God good rish.
Yor love wey nor dey fail go last forever. Yor goodness dey forever like di heavens.
God sey, “I don make kovenant with David, my savant wey I choose. I don promise am sey:
‘I go make en shidren-shidren king forever; dem go sidan for di throne from naw go rish wen di world go end.’ ”
So my God, heavens go praiz di great and wonderful tins wey Yu don do and angels go praiz Yu bikos of how Yu dey good.
My God, na who pipol won take kompare Yu for all di heavens? E get any angel wey bi like God?
Even angels dey honor am wen dem gada togeda and E great pass evribody wey dey round en throne.
My Oga God wey dey rule evriwhere! Nobody dey strong like Yu, bikos Yu always dey do good.
Na Yu dey rule di sea and kontrol dia waves.
Yu distroy and kill Rahab and Yu skata all yor enemies with yor mighty hand.
Na Yu get di heavens and di eart; evritin wey dey di eart na yor own, bikos na Yu kreate all of dem.
Na Yu kreate di nort and sout. Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon dey praiz yor name.
Pawa dey yor hand; yor hand strong well-well! Wons Yu raiz yor rite hand wey get pawa, Yu dey always dey win.
Na raitiousness and justice Yu take make di foundashon for yor throne. Yu dey rule with trut and love wey nor dey fail.
Pipol wey dey woship Yu, dey always dey happy; dem go waka for di lite wey dey yor present, bikos Yu don favor dem.
Dem dey happy evriday bikos of di wonderful tins wey Yu dey do and yor raitiousness dey save dem.
Na Yu bi dia strent and glory and e dey sweet Yu to make us strong and bikos Yu favor us, wi dey always win.
Yes! Awa proteshon dey kom from God and na en wey bi di Holy One for Israel, bi awa king.
Before-before, Yu tok thru vishon to pipol wey dey obey Yu. Yu sey, “I don choose sojas and I don selet one yong man from di pipol as king.
I don si my savant David and I don anoint am with my holy oil.
I go support am with my hand and with my hand wey get pawa, I go make am strong.
En enemies nor go fit win am and wiked pipol pawa nor go fit opress am.
I go distroy pipol wey dey tok against am kon kill doz wey hate am.
My goodness and love wey nor dey fail, go dey with am and with my authority, e go grow with pawa.
I go make am rule many kingdoms and en pawa go strong well-well.
Den e go koll mi kon sey, ‘Yu bi my Papa, my God and di Rock wey dey save mi.’
I go make am my first-born and bikos I choose am as king, na-im pipol go praiz pass for di whole world.
I go love and dey kind to am forever and my kovenant with am, nor go ever end.
I go gi-am one son wey go take-ova from am and just as di days for heaven nor dey end, na so too en kingdom nor go ever end.
But if en shidren-shidren nor gri listin to my kommand and disobey my laws;
if dem nor gri follow my ways or do wetin I tok,
I go ponish dem with rod kon flog dem with kane, bikos of dia sturbones and sins.
But I nor go stop to love am or forget di promise wey I make with am.
No! I nor go break my promise; I nor go take back one singol word wey I tok.
Yes! I don promise David and bikos I dey holy, I nor go fit lie:
en shidren-shidren go bi king forever and en kingdom go dey forever like di sun.
E go dey forever like di moon and di sky go bi witness to show how I really dey faithful!”
But naw, God, Yu don rijet and porshu David shidren-shidren. Yu dey vex with di king wey Yu anoint.
Yu don forget di kovenant wey Yu make with am kon trow en crown for dust.
Yu don break di wall wey dey guide am kon distroy evritin wey dey protet am.
Anybody wey dey pass, dey tif from am and en neighbours don take am dey do yeye.
Yu don give en enemies pawa kon make dem dey happy.
Yu make sure sey en swod nor mean anytin and Yu nor gri help am for war again.
Yu don end en glory kon trowey and skata en throne.
Yu don make am old before en time kon disgrace am for publik.
So, my God, na how long dis tins go happen? Yu go hide yor face forever, abi Yu go just dey vex like dat?
Make Yu remember how my life short rish and how human being life empty and nor mean anytin!
Evribody go die, bikos nobody fit stay forever and nobody go fit run from grave pawa.
So my God, where all di good tins wey Yu bin do for us; di ones wey Yu do just as Yu promise David?
Make Yu konsida how dem dey disgrace yor savant and how I go must bear all di curse wey pipol dey curse mi.
Yor enemies dey laf and fool mi. Anywhere wey di king wey Yu anoint go, na so-so laf dem dey laf am.
But with all dis tins wey dey happen, na God wi go praiz forever and ever! Amen and Amen!
