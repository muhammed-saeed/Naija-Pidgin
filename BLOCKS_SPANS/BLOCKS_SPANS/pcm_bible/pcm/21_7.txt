To get good name betta pass perfume wey dear well-well and di day wen pesin die, betta pass di day wen dem born am.
E betta to go house where dem for dey kry dan to go where dem for dey celebrate; bikos evribody go die one day. So make pipol wey still dey alive put dis one for dia mind.
E betta make pesin dey tink about life, dan sey e dey laf anyhow. Bikos to dey tink and dey kwayet, good well-well for di heart.
Pesin wey always dey tink about happiness, na fool, but pesin wey get sense, go still dey tink about deat too.
E betta make wise pesin korrect yu dan make fool praiz yu.
Bikos just as shuku-shuku dey burn for fire, na so fool life bi. Dis one too dey yuzles.
True-true, opreshon fit turn wise man to fool, just as bribe dey korrupt di mind.
To finish anytin wey yu start, betta pass wen yu start am, just as to dey patient betta pass to dey proud.
Always dey kontrol yor tempa, bikos vexnashon go turn yu to fool.
Nor ever ask, “Wetin make evritin bad dis days pass as dem bi before?” Bikos e nor dey wise to ask dat kind kweshon.
Wisdom dey sweet well-well wen money dey, bikos both wisdom and money dey good well-well for dis life.
Wisdom and money fit give yu anytin wey yu wont for life, but na only wisdom fit save yor life.
Make yu asept di way God kreate tins; abi e get who go fit strait wetin God don bend?
Wen God give yu money, make yu tank God and enjoy am, but wen sofa kom, make yu know sey e still kom from God too, bikos nobody go fit tok how tumoro go bi.
I don si evritin for dis yuzles life; good yong pipol wey kwik die before dia time and wiked pipol wey dey get long life.
So make yu nor dey too good or too wise, if not e go distroy yu!
Make yu nor dey too wiked or bihave like fool, if not, yu fit die before yor time!
But make yu listin to all dis warnin, bikos anybody wey dey fear God, go dey save.
Pesin wey wise, strong pass ten pipol wey dey rule di town,
bikos e nor get anybody for dis world wey dey good well-well and nor dey sin.
So, make yu nor listin to wetin pipol dey tok, if not, yu go hear yor savant dey curse yu,
bikos yu know for yor own heart too, how many times yusef don curse oda pipol.
I dey always try my best make wisdom guide wetin I dey tink and evritin wey I dey do. Den I tell mysef, “I dey ready to learn” but I nor fit undastand am at-all.
Evritin wey don happen, too hard for human being to undastand; dem too deep for us to tink about.
So I try to search evriwhere to get wisdom and to undastand why tins dey happen di way dem dey happen and I dey ready to prove to mysef sey, wikedness dey stupid and foolishness dey bring madness.
I still si sey, woman wey wont make man sleep with am, dey set trap for am and dis one dey wiked and bad pass deat. Pipol wey dey obey God, go fit eskape am, but doz wey dey sin, go enter di trap.
Di Tisha sey: “I undastand all dis tins wen I dey try to look for ansa to evritin.
“Wetin I dey find since, I neva still si am; I si sey among 1,000 pipol, na only one man dey good, but I nor si any woman wey good among dem.
But I still learn dis one too: God kreate evribody make dem dey good, but dem don dey do wiked tins as dem like.”
