Make yu undastand sey, for di last days before dis world go end, tins go hard well- well.
Pipol go dey tink of diasef alone; dey like money; dey boast; dey karry body up; dey tok bad about God; dey disobey dia papa and mama and dem nor dey tank even pipol wey do good for dem.
Dem nor get love or forgivenes; dem go dey gossip odas and nor fit kontrol diasef. Dem go dey wiked and hate wetin good.
Dem go betray dia friends; dey do tins before dem tink; dey feel sey dem dey important and dem go love enjoyment pass God.
If yu look dem well-well, dem bi like God pipol, but dem don rijet God pawa. So make yu run from dis kind pipol.
Bikos na dis pipol dey hide enter pipol house kon sleep with wimen wey nor get sense; wey dey sin well-well and wetin dey sweet dis wimen to do, na-im dey kontrol dem.
Doz kind wimen dey try to learn, but dem nor dey fit know di trut.
Just as Jannes and Jambres oppoz Moses; na so too, dis pipol wey dia mind block and nor get faith, dey oppoz di trut.
But dem nor go do am tey, bikos evribody go si how dem foolish rish, just as e happen to Jannes and Jambres.
But yu don know my tishings; di way I dey live my life and why I dey do wetin I dey do: my faith; patient; love and as I dey bear.
Yu know di wahala and sofa wey happen to mi for Antiok, Ikonium and for Lystra. I bear all dis wahala and Christ save mi from dem.
True-true, anybody wey won live di kind life wey God wont inside Christ, make e know sey e must sofa.
But wiked and evil pipol nor go prosper. Dem go deceive odas and dem go deceive diasef too.
But make yu kontinue to do wetin yu learn. Yu know sey dis tins na true and yu trust doz wey tish yu.
Dem don tish yu God word since yu bi small pikin and yu don get salvashon to receive di wisdom wey dey kom thru Christ, wey yu trust.
Evry word wey dey Bible, kom from God and dem dey good to tish us di trut and to know di tins wey dey wrong for awa life. God word dey korrect us wen wi dey wrong and e dey tish us to do good tins,
so dat as wi dey do God work, wi go fit do am well and wi go get evritin wey wi nid to take do good tins.
