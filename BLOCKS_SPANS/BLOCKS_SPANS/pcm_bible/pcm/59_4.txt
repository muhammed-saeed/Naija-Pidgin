Wetin dey make una kworel and fight? Nor bi di tins wey dey hongry una to do?
Yu wont sometin, but yu nor get am; yu dey kill, dey wont wetin oda pipol get and yu nor dey fit get am; so yu go kon dey kworel and fight. Yu nor get, bikos yu nor ask God make E give yu.
Wen yu ask for sometin, yu nor receive am, bikos yu nor ask well and yu won take am do wetin yu like.
Una wey dey do bad tins for dis world, una nor know sey to bi dis world friend, mean sey una bi God enemy? So anybody wey gri sey en and dis world na friend, don make ensef God enemy.
Abi yu tink sey God nor mean wetin E tok wen E sey, “Di Spirit wey I put inside una dey jealous well-well?”
But E give us plenty grace. Na dis make God word sey, “God dey against pesin wey dey karry body up, but E dey give grace to pipol wey dey put dia body down.”
So, make yu give yorsef to God. But rijet di devil and e go run komot from where yu dey.
Draw near God and E go draw near yu. Una wey bi sina, make una wosh una hand and una wey get doubol mind, make una heart dey klean.
Make una kry and make sorrow dey una heart, den una go show sey una nor dey happy.
If una put una body down for God, E go karry una go up.
My brodas and sistas, make una nor tok bad about each oda. Anybody wey tok bad or judge en broda or sista for Christ, e dey tok bad about di law and e dey judge di law. But if una judge di law, den una nor dey obey di law, but una don bikom di law judge bi dat.
Na only one Pesin give di law and na-im bi judge. Na-im dey save and distroy. Yu wey dey judge yor neighbour, na who yu even tink sey yu bi?
Look, yu wey dey sey, “Today or tumoro, wi go-go dis or dat town go stay der for one year and do business kon get gain,”
but yu nor know tumoro. Wetin yor life bi like? Yu bi like smoke wey dey kom out from fire. Pipol go si am, den small time e go vanish.
Instead, yu suppose to sey, “If God wont, wi go dey alive and wi go do dis or dat tin.”
But as e bi so, yu dey boast dey karry body up. All dat kind boastin nor good.
So anybody wey know wetin good and e nor do am, don kommit sin bi dat.
