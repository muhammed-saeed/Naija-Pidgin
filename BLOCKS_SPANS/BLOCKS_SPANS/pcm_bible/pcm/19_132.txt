David Song
My God, my heart nor dey proud; my eyes nor dey look anyhow. I nor dey worry mysef with matter wey too heavy for mi to bear.
Instead, I dey kwayet and dey silent like pikin wey nor dey kry for breast milk again. Yes, I kwayet like pikin wey en mama karry.
So Israel pipol, make una put una hope for God hand, both naw and forever more!
