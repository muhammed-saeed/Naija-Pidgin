Elifaz wey kom from Teman still sey:
“E get any wise pesin wey God fit gain from?
Yu feel sey God get gain from di good tins wey yu dey do or di rite way wey yu dey follow?
God dey ponish yu, bikos yu too obey and respet am?
No! Na bikos of yor sin and all di oda bad tins wey yu do.
Yu sey make yor broda pay di money wey e dey hold yu kon seize all en klot.
Pipol wey don taya to work, yu nor agri give dem wota drink and wen dem dey hongry, yu nor give dem food chop.
Yu dey opress pipol with yor pawa and pozishon.
Nor bi only sey yu nor gri help wimen wey nor get husband again, but yu dey ponish and kollect from shidren wey dia papa and mama don die.
Naw, si as trobol surround yu and fear don dey kill yu small-small.
Yu nor dey si again, bikos di trobol don too dark for yor eye and wota don kover yu.
God too dey big! E high pass di heavens and from der E dey look di stars as dem high rish.
But yu still ask, ‘Wetin God know? How E won take judge us thru dis tick darkness?’
Yu feel sey as di kloud tick rish, God nor go si as E dey waka for heaven?
Yu really won waka for di road wey wiked pipol dey pass?
Even before dia time end, wota don karry dem go.
Dis na di pipol wey rijet God, dem bilive sey E nor fit do dem anytin.
Na dis God make dem get money, yet I nor fit undastand how wiked pipol dey tink sef.
Good pipol dey happy and doz wey dia belle klean, dey laf.
Evritin wey wiked pipol get don skata and fire don burn di ones wey remain.
Job! Abeg, go setol with God. Nor dey bihave like sey God na yor enemy. If yu follow am make peace, E go bless yu.
Make yu follow di tins wey E dey tish kon keep en words for yor heart.
Make yu go back go meet God; if yu remove wiked tins for yor house, E go karry yu up.
If yu stop to porshu money kon trowey yor gold for river,
God wey dey heaven go bi yor propaty. E go bi yor gold and silva.
Den yu go bilive God kon know sey na-im dey give happiness.
Wen yu pray, E go ansa yu and yu go keep di promise wey yu don make.
Yu go prosper for evritin wey yu dey do and lite go shine for yor way.
God dey save pipol wey dey honbol, but doz wey feel sey dem wise, E dey disgrace dem.
God go save pesin wey nor dey innocent, bikos yor hand dey klean.”
