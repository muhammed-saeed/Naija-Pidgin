“Evritin wey man dey do for dis life nor bi struggol? Abi awa days nor bi like savant wey dem hire to work?
Like savant wey dey wait make nite kwik kom; like worker wey dey wait make dem pay am.
Mont to mont, I nor get anytin to live for; evry nite dey kause pain for mi.
Wen I sleep, I dey tink dey sey, ‘Wen day go take break?’ I dey waka for nite dey wait make day break.
Worm don full my body, sickness don kover my body with dirty; my body don skata with sore.
My days just dey run kwik-kwik like moto; but for di end, I nor get hope.
My God! Make Yu remember sey my life bi like breeze and my happiness don end.
Una dey si mi naw with una eyes, but una nor go si mi again. Wen una dey look for mi, I go don go.
As kloud dey vanish, na so who die nor dey kom back again.
E nor go ever kom back to en house and nobody go si am again.
“No! I nor go fit klose my mout; I dey vex for my spirit, so I must tok. I must tok as e dey pain mi for my mind.
Why Yu put mi for kage make pipol dey look mi? I bi wota juju?
Make I sey my bed go give mi rest and my pillow go reduce my komplain?
But Yu still dey make mi fear for dream; yor vishon dey make mi fear well-well.
E betta make I kill mysef, dan dis kind wiked life wey I dey live.
I don taya for life; I nor go live forever. Abeg make yu live mi, bikos my life nor good.
“Wetin bi man wey Yu dey worry for? Why Yu dey borda yorsef with di tin wey Yu kreate?
Yu dey visit am for morning and evritime, Yu won try or test am.
Nor look mi again, make Yu leave mi alone, so dat I go swallow my own spit.
Yu wey dey wosh us, na wetin I do Yu? Abi I don sin against Yu? Why Yu dey target mi? I bi wahala to Yu?
Yu nor fit just forgive mi my sins? Yu nor fit just sorry for all di bad tins wey I do? I go soon die and wen Yu dey look for mi, I go don go.”
