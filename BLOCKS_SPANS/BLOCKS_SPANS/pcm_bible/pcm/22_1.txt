Dis na Solomon love song.
Yes! Make yu kiss mi well-well, bikos to sleep with yu sweet pass wine.
Si as yor perfume dey scent well-well and yor name bi like di perfume wey fine pass. No wonder wimen love yu well-well!
Draw mi follow yu! Make wi kwik komot here! Make di king take mi go en room. Awa king, wi dey happy well-well, bikos of yu and wi like yor love pass wine. Yes, di yong wimen dey honor yu and dat na di rite tin to do.
Jerusalem wimen, I bi black and fine woman; I black like Kedar and Solomon tents.
So make una nor dey look mi anyhow bikos sun don make my skin black. My brodas dey vex for mi, so dem kon force mi dey work for farm and bikos of dat, I nor fit kare for my body.
My love, make yu tell mi! Na where yu won go feed yor animals today? Where yor sheep dem go for rest dis aftanoon? Make yu tell mi, if not I go dey waka up-and-down like ashawo for where yor friends and dia animals dey!
My woman! Di one wey fine pass among wimen! If yu dey find mi, make yu follow my animals footstep rish where I dey kon kare for yor small goats near di shepad tent.
My love, yu bi like woman horse for where Fero man horse dem dey.
Yor face dey shine well-well, bikos of di oil wey dem take rub am and di difren shains wey yu wear, don make yor neck fine too.
So, wi go make gold ear-ring and silva beads for yu.
As di king sidan for en tabol where e for dey do party, my perfume smell kon make am dey happy.
As my love put en head on-top my breast thru-out di nite, en whole body kon dey smell like myrrh.
My love bi like Henna flower wey dey shine well-well for En-Gedi Field.
Si as my darlin fine well-well, make yu si as yu fine rish! Yor eyes bi like dove own!
Yes! Yu too fine my love and I dey happy to always dey with yu. Na di grass go bi awa bed
and na cedar wi go take design awa house kon build di roof with Cypress tree.
