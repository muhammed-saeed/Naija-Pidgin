David Song
My God, Yu shek my heart well-well and Yu know evritin about mi.
Yu know wen I sidan or wen I stand up. Yu know wetin I dey tink even wen I dey far from Yu.
Yu dey si mi wen I dey travel and wen I dey rest for house. Yu know evritin wey I dey do.
My God, Yu know wetin I won tok even before I tok am.
Yu dey my front kon still dey follow mi for back and yor blessings dey my head.
Di tins wey Yu know, too dey wonderful for mi; dem too big for mi to undastand!
I nor go fit hide from yor Spirit! I nor fit run komot from yor present at-all!
If I run go heaven, Yu dey der; if I die go grave, Yu dey der too.
If I sey make I fly as day dey break kon go di oda side for di sea,
yor hand go guide mi for der and yor rite hand go support mi.
Even if I sey, “darkness go kom and day go turn to nite around mi,”
e nor get how di darkness dark rish wey Yu nor go fit si mi, bikos nite brite like day for yor eye and darkness and lite na di same tin to Yu.
True-true, na Yu make my mind and my heart; na Yu arrange mi for my mama belle.
I go tank Yu, bikos di tins wey Yu dey do, dey wonderful and dey sopraiz mi. Yu know mi well-well;
my bones nor hide from Yu, even wen Yu make mi for sekret kon put mi for di eart.
Yu dey si mi wen I dey my mama belle. All di days wey I go live, dem rite am for yor book, even before dem born mi.
My God, si as e hard mi to tink about wetin Yu dey tink for mi, bikos dem plenty well-well!
If I try to kount dem, dem go many pass san-san. Even if I kount dem finish, Yu go still dey with mi.
My God, I wish sey Yu go just kill wiked pipol finish! So make wiked pipol leave mi alone o-o!
Dem nor gri do wetin Yu kommand; dem like to dey do wiked tins and awa enemies dey like to lie well-well.
So my God, si as I hate pipol wey hate and dey oppoz Yu!
True-true, I really hate dem and dem don bi my enemies naw!
Look mi well, den make Yu tell mi wetin I dey tink! Test mi and Yu go know wetin I wont!
Show mi anytin wey make Yu dey vex for mi. So take mi pass di road wey dey give life wey nor dey end!
