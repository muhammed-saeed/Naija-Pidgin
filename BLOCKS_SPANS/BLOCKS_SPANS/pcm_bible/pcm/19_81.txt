Asaf Song For Di Kwayamasta
Di Shepad for Israel, make Yu listin to us. Yu wey dey kare for Josef shidren-shidren, just as shepad dey kare for en sheep. My God wey high pass di angels, make Yu show yor glory wey dey shine
to Efraim, Benjamin and Manasseh pipol. Make Yu show yor mighty pawa, den kom save us!
My God, make Yu bring us back to yorsef again. Make yor face shine upon us again and na only den wi go get rest of mind.
My Oga wey bi God for Heaven Sojas, na how long Yu go dey vex for awa prayers?
Yu don make us dey chop sorrow like food kon drink tears wey full bucket.
Yu don give oda pipol rizin to dey laf us and naw, awa enemies don take us dey do yeye.
My Oga wey bi God for Heaven Sojas, make Yu bring us back to yorsef again. Make yor face shine upon us again and na only den wi go get rest of mind.
Yu take us from Egypt like grape fruit, den Yu porshu di wiked nashons kon give us dia land.
Yu klear di groun for us and wi stay der kon many for di land.
Awa shadow dey kover di mountins; awa branches dey kover di mighty cedars.
Before-before, wi spread go west for Mediterranean Sea and Eufrates River.
But naw, wetin make Yu break awa walls so dat evribody wey dey pass go fit tif awa fruit?
Even wild animals from bush dey kom chop dem too.
Awa God, di Warrior wey nobody dey si, wi dey beg make Yu kom back. Make Yu from heaven look kon si di wahala wey wi dey face. Make Yu kare for dis grape tree
wey Yu plant by yorsef; bikos na Yu raiz dis pikin up by yorsef.
Make awa enemies nor chop and burn us finish. Make dem die, bikos Yu nor dey happy with dem.
Make Yu support di ones wey Yu choose; di ones wey Yu raiz for yorsef!
Den wi nor go turn from Yu. Make Yu bring us back and wi go pray to Yu!
Awa God, di warrior wey nobody dey si, make Yu give us life again! Make Yu just smile for us and wi go dey save!
