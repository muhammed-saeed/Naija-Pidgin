Afta Jesus don koll di twelf disciples togeda, e give dem pawa and authority to drive demon and to heal pipol wey nor well.
Den e kon send dem go prish about God Kingdom and heal pipol wey nor well.
E tell dem, “Make una nor take walkin stik, bag, bread, money or estra klot follow body.
Make una stay for any house wey una enter until una komot for dat aria.
Anywhere wey dem nor welkom una, make una shake di san from una leg as una dey komot and dis go bi witness against dem.”
Di disciples kon travel go all di village dem, dey prish di Good News and heal pipol for evriwhere.
Wen Herod wey bi ruler hear about evritin wey dey happen, e konfuse, bikos some pipol sey John don wake-up from deat
and odas sey Elijah don appear, some still sey one old profet don wake-up.
Herod kon sey, “I orda make dem kut John head komot, but who bi dis one wey I dey hear all dis tins about so?” Bikos of dat, Herod kon try to find out more about Jesus.
Wen di apostles kom back, dem tell Jesus evritin wey dem don do. Den Jesus take only dem follow body go Betsaida.
But wen pipol know, dem kon follow Jesus and en disciples go der. E welkom dem, den tell dem about God Kingdom and e heal doz wey nor well.
Wen day don dey dark, di disciples kon tell Jesus, “Tell dis pipol make dem go, so dat dem go-go di village and farm wey near dis aria go fine food chop kon sleep for der, bikos dis place na wildaness.”
But Jesus ansa, “Make una give dem food chop.” Dem kon sey, “Na only five bread and two fish wi get, unless yu wont sey make wi go buy food for all of dem.”
(Di men wey dey der alone rish 5,000). Jesus tell en disciples, “Tell di pipol make dem sidan fifty-fifty.”
Di disciples do as Jesus tok and all di pipol kon sidan.
Den Jesus take di five bread and two fish, e look heaven, tank God, den e kon divide dem. E give di bread and fish to en disciples, make dem share am for di pipol.
Evribody chop beleful and wen dem gada di food wey remain, e full twelf basket.
As Jesus dey pray alone and en disciples dey near am, e kon ask dem, “Na who pipol dey tok sey I bi?”
Dem ansa, “Some sey yu bi John di Baptist, odas sey yu bi Elijah and odas still sey yu bi one old profet wey wake-up from deat.”
Den Jesus ask dem, “But who una tok sey I bi?” Pita kon ansa, “Yu bi di Mezaya wey God send.”
But Jesus warn dem well-well sey make dem nor tell anybody about am.
Den Jesus tell dem, “God Pikin go sofa many tins: di eldas, di priest oga dem and di law tishas go rijet am, dem go kill-am and afta three days, God go wake am up.”
So Jesus tell all of dem, “If pesin won follow mi, e must forget ensef, karry en cross evriday, dey follow mi.
Bikos anybody wey won save en life, go luz am and anybody wey luz en life bikos of mi, go save am.
Wetin pesin go gain if e get di whole world, but e luz en soul?
Anybody wey dey shame for mi and my word, Man Pikin go shame for am wen e go kom back for en glory and di glory wey en Papa and di angels get.
But I tell una true word, some pipol wey stand for here nor go die, before dem go si God Kingdom.”
One week afta Jesus tok all dis tins, e kon take Pita, John and James go on-top one mountin go pray.
As e dey pray, en face shange and en klot kon dey shine like lite.
At wons, Moses and Elijah kon dey tok with am.
As dem appear with glory, dem kon tell Jesus how e go sofa and die for Jerusalem, as dem rite for God word.
Pita and di odas wey dey with am dey sleep before, but at wons sleep komot from dia eye and dem si Jesus glory and di two men wey stand with am.
Den as Moses and Elijah won go, Pita kon tell Jesus, “Oga God, e good make wi stay here. Make wi build three tent, one for yu, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (Pita nor even know wetin e dey tok.)
As e still dey tok, one kind kloud surround dem, fear kon katch di disciples, as Moses and Elijah enter di kloud.
One vois from di kloud kon sey, “Dis na my pikin wey I choose. Make una listin to am!”
Afta di vois don tok finish, Jesus kon dey alone for di place, but di disciples kwayet and dem nor tell anybody wetin dem si.
Di next day wen dem kom down from di mountin, many pipol kom meet Jesus.
Den one man among di pipol kry kom, “Tisha, Abeg yu, si my pikin, na-im bi di only boy wey I get!
Evil spirit dey worry am and e dey make am shaut. Di spirit dey shake am and foam dey komot for en mout. Di spirit nor gri leave am and e dey trobol am well-well.
Abeg yor disciples make dem drive di demon komot, but dem nor fit.”
Jesus kon tell dem, “Una wey dey do bad tins and nor gri bilive, how long I go stay with una?” Den e tell di man, “Bring yor pikin kom here.”
As di boy dey kom, di demon trow am for groun, e start to dey shake and foam kon dey komot from en mout. Den Jesus kommand di demon make e komot and e heal di boy, kon gi-am to en papa.
Den evribody wey dey der kon sopraiz as dem si God pawa. But as di pipol still dey sopraiz, Jesus kon tell en disciples,
“Make una nor forget wetin I won tell una, dem go sell God Pikin give human being.”
But dem nor undastand dis word, bikos God hide am from dem make dem for nor know wetin di word mean. Di disciples demsef dey fear to ask Jesus about di matter.
Di disciples kon dey ask demsef, “Who big pass among us for God Kingdom?”
Wen Jesus know wetin dem dey tok, e bring one small pikin near am
kon tell dem, “Anybody wey welkom dis small pikin bikos of mi, don welkom mi and anybody wey welkom mi, don welkom God wey send mi, bikos di pesin wey small pass among una, na-im big pass for God Kingdom.”
John tell Jesus, “Oga God, wi si one man dey drive demon with yor name and wi tell am make e stop, bikos e nor dey with us.”
Jesus kon ansa am, “Nor stop am, bikos anybody wey nor dey against us, dey awa side.”
Wen di time wey God go take Jesus go heaven don near, Jesus tink for en mind sey, e go-go Jerusalem.
E kon send messenjas go for front and dem enter one village for Samaria go prepare evritin before e go rish der,
but di villagers nor gri welkom am, bikos dem si sey, e won go Jerusalem.
Wen James and John si wetin happen, dem kon sey, “Oga God, yu wont make wi koll fire down from heaven kon kill dis pipol?”
But Jesus turn warn dem,
den en and dem kon go anoda village.
As Jesus dey go for road, one man kon tell am, “I won follow yu go anywhere wey yu dey go.”
Jesus kon tell am, “Rabbits get whole, birds get nest, but Man Pikin nor get anywhere to put en head!”
Jesus kon tell anoda man, “Make yu follow mi,” but dat one sey, “Oga God, make I first go beri my papa.”
Jesus kon tell am, “Make doz wey don die, beri who don die. But make yu go prish about God Kingdom.”
Anoda pesin kon sey, “Oga God! I go like to follow yu, but make I first go tell my family bye-bye.”
Jesus tell am, “Pesin wey put hand for dis work, den e kon dey look back, nor get part for God Kingdom.”
