Wen I still dey prison for di kourtyard, God tok to mi again.
Na mi, God do dis tins! Na mi God, make di eart kon put am for where e dey so. Dem know mi as Oga God; naw I dey tell yu,
“Koll mi wen yu dey pray and I go ansa yu; I go tell yu great and wonderful tins wey yu nor know about.
Mi, di Oga wey bi Israel God sey, war and wahala go skata all di house for Jerusalem and di royal palis for Judah.
Una won go fight Babilon pipol, but una sojas nor betta pass doz wey don die, bikos as I dey vex, I don make up my mind to distroy dem. I don turn from dem, bikos of dia wikedness.
But I go heal di town and en pipol kon make dem well again. I go give dem peace forever and dem go dey save.
I go make Israel and Judah pipol prosper and I go build dem as dem bi before.
I go forgive dem dia sin. Yes! I go forgive dem all di sin wey make dem go against my kommand.
Jerusalem go bring joy, honor and pride for mi and all di nashons for di world go fear wen dem hear about di good tins wey I go do for Jerusalem pipol and how I go make dia town prosper.”
God sey, “Una dey sey, ‘Dis place bi like desert, bikos pipol or animals nor dey stay inside again.’ Una korrect; bikos Judah town and all di street for Jerusalem go dey empty; pipol or animal nor go stay der, but una go hear pipol dey shaut dey happy for dis place again.
Una go hear am kon shaut with happiness, with joy and belle go sweet una wen una dey do marriage. Una go hear pipol dey sing as dem dey kom tank mi with dia ofrin. Dem go sey, ‘Make wi tank God wey dey mighty, bikos E good well-well and en love dey forever.’ I go make dis land prosper as e bi before. Mi, wey bi God, don tok.”
God wey mighty sey, “Dis land wey bi like desert where pipol or animals nor dey stay, I go turn am to where fresh green leaf go dey and shepad go take dia sheep go chop for der.
Shepad go kount dia sheep again for all di towns wey dey di hill kountry; di valley; Judah sout; Benjamin land; di village wey round Jerusalem and all di town for Judah. Mi, wey bi God, don tok.”
God sey, “Di time dey kom wen I go do wetin I promise Israel and Judah pipol.
For dat time, I go choose king wey dey raitious from David shidren-shidren. “Di king go do wetin dey korrect and good for evriwhere for di land.
As e dey rule, Judah pipol go dey save, while Jerusalem pipol go stay for peace. For dat time, dem go koll Jerusalem town, ‘God Don Save Us.’
Mi wey bi God, promise sey na only David shidren-shidren go always bi king for Israel
and na from only Levi tribe priest go for always kom and serve, offa burnt ofrin, korn ofrin and sakrifice for mi.”
God tell mi,
“If yu fit break di kovenant wey I make with nite and day, so dat dem nor go kom out again for di korrect time,
den yu go still fit break di kovenant wey I make with my savant David and Levi tribe wey sey, ‘Kings go always kom from David family and na Levi family go always bi priests.’
I go make my savant, David shidren- shidren and all di priest from Levi tribe plenty, so dat dem nor go fit kount dem, just as dem nor fit kount star for sky or san-san for wotaside.”
God still tell mi sey,
“Yu si as pipol dey sey I don rijet Israel and Judah pipol; di two family wey I choose? Na dis make dem nor dey respet my pipol at-all, bikos dem nor si dem as strong nashon again.
But mi wey bi God don make kovenant with di nite and day and I don make di law wey dey kontrol di heaven and eart.
Since I don do dis tin, I go keep my kovenant with my savant Jakob and David shidren-shidren. I go choose one of David shidren-shidren make e rule ova Abraham, Isaak and Jakob shidren-shidren. I go sorry for my pipol kon make dem prosper again.”
