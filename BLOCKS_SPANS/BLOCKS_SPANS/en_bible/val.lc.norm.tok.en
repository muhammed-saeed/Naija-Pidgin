Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, an Apostle by the selection of God, given authority as a preacher of the good news, 
Of which God had given word before by his prophets in the holy Writings, 
About his Son who, in the flesh, came from the family of David, 
But was marked out as Son of God in power by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead; Jesus Christ our Lord, 
Through whom grace has been given to us, sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
Among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ: 
To all those who are in Rome, loved by God, marked out as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
First of all, I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because news of your faith has gone into all the world. 
For God is my witness, whose servant I am in spirit in the good news of his Son, that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers, 
And that I am ever making prayers that God will give me a good journey to you. 
For I have a strong desire to see you, and to give you some grace of the spirit, so that you may be made strong; 
That is to say, that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me. 
You may be certain, my brothers, that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you (but till now I was kept from it), so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I have had it from the other nations. 
I have a debt to Greeks and to the nations outside; to the wise and to those who have no learning. 
For which reason I have the desire, as far as I am able, to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in Rome. 
For I have no feeling of shame about the good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first, and then to the Greek. 
For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is said in the holy Writings, The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith. 
For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing; 
Because the knowledge of God may be seen in them, God having made it clear to them. 
For from the first making of the world, those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, his eternal power and existence, are fully made clear, he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made, so that men have no reason for wrongdoing: 
Because, having the knowledge of God, they did not give glory to God as God, and did not give praise, but their minds were full of foolish things, and their hearts, being without sense, were made dark. 
Seeming to be wise, they were in fact foolish, 
And by them the glory of the eternal God was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal, and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth. 
For this reason God gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts, working shame in their bodies with one another: 
Because by them the true word of God was changed into that which is false, and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made, and not to him who made it, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it. 
For this reason God gave them up to evil passions, and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural: 
And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another, men doing shame with men, and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil-doing. 
And because they had not the mind to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an evil mind, to do those things which are not right; 
Being full of all wrongdoing, evil, desire for the goods of others, hate, envy, putting to death, fighting, deceit, cruel ways, evil talk, and false statements about others; 
Hated by God, full of pride, without respect, full of loud talk, given to evil inventions, not honouring father or mother, 
Without knowledge, not true to their undertakings, unkind, having no mercy:
Who, though they have knowledge of the law of God, that the fate of those who do these things is death, not only go on doing these things themselves, but give approval to those who do them.So you have no reason, whoever you are, for judging: for in judging another you are judging yourself, for you do the same things. 
And we are conscious that God is a true judge against those who do such things. 
But you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself, are you hoping that God's decision will not take effect against you? 
Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you, waiting and putting up with you for so long, not seeing that in his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart?
But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness; 
Who will give to every man his right reward: 
To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal life: 
But to those who, from a love of competition, are not guided by what is true, will come the heat of his wrath, 
Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil, to the Jew first and then to the Greek; 
But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good, to the Jew first and then to the Greek: 
For one man is not different from another before God. 
All those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law: and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law; 
For it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before God, but only the doers: 
For when the Gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law, they are a law to themselves; 
Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts, their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it, while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval; 
In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men, as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher, through Jesus Christ. 
But as for you who have the name of Jew, and are resting on the law, and take pride in God, 
And have knowledge of his desires, and are a judge of the things which are different, having the learning of the law, 
In the belief that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in the dark, 
A teacher of the foolish, having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true; 
You who give teaching to others, do you give it to yourself? you who say that a man may not take what is not his, do you take what is not yours? 
You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God? 
You who take pride in the law, are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law? 
For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings. 
It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law, but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not. 
If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law, will it not be credited to them as circumcision? 
And they, by their keeping of the law without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision. 
The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly, and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh:
But he is a Jew who is a secret one, whose circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.How then is the Jew better off? or what profit is there in circumcision?
Much in every way: first of all because the words of God were given to them. 
And if some have no faith, will that make the faith of God without effect? 
In no way: but let God be true, though every man is seen to be untrue; as it is said in the Writings, That your words may be seen to be true, and you may be seen to be right when you are judged. 
But if the righteousness of God is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said? is it wrong for God to be angry (as men may say)? 
In no way: because if it is so, how is God able to be the judge of all the world? 
But if, because I am untrue, God being seen to be true gets more glory, why am I to be judged as a sinner? 
Let us not do evil so that good may come (a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made), because such behaviour will have its right punishment. 
What then? are we worse off than they? In no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin; 
As it is said in the holy Writings, There is not one who does righteousness;
Not one who has the knowledge of what is right, not one who is a searcher after God;
They have all gone out of the way, there is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much as one: 
Their throat is like an open place of death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of snakes is under their lips:
Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words:
Their feet are quick in running after blood; 
Destruction and trouble are in their ways; 
And of the way of peace they have no knowledge: 
There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
Now, we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all men may be judged by God: 
Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin. 
But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the law and the prophets; 
That is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all those who have faith; and one man is not different from another, 
For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God; 
And they may have righteousness put to their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus: 
Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment; 
And to make clear his righteousness now, so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus.
What reason, then, is there for pride? It is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith. 
For this reason, then, a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law. 
Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles: 
If God is one; and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision, and through faith to those who have not circumcision. 
Do we, then, through faith make the law of no effect? in no way: but we make it clear that the law is important.What, then, may we say that Abraham, our father after the flesh, has got?
For if Abraham got righteousness by works, he has reason for pride; but not before God. 
But what does it say in the holy Writings? And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness. 
Now, the reward is credited to him who does works, not as of grace but as a debt. 
But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his account as righteousness. 
As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying, 
Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing, and whose sins are covered. 
Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord. 
Is this blessing, then, for the circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness.
How, then, was it judged? when he had circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did not have it: 
And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their account; 
And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision.
For God's word, that the earth would be his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word of God has no power; 
For the outcome of the law is wrath; but where there is no law it will not be broken. 
For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, 
(As it is said in the holy Writings, I have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things which are not are as if they were. 
Who without reason for hope, in faith went on hoping, so that he became the father of a number of nations, as it had been said, So will your seed be.
And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children: 
Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God, 
And being certain that God was able to keep his word. 
For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness. 
Now, it was not because of him only that this was said, 
But for us in addition, to whose account it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead, 
Who was put to death for our evil-doing, and came to life again so that we might have righteousness.For which reason, because we have righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 
Through whom, in the same way, we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God. 
And not only so, but let us have joy in our troubles: in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting; 
And waiting gives experience; and experience, hope: 
And hope does not put to shame; because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us. 
For when we were still without strength, at the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers. 
Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man, though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life. 
But God has made clear his love to us, in that, when we were still sinners, Christ gave his life for us. 
Much more, if we now have righteousness by his blood, will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him. 
For if, when we were haters of God, the death of his Son made us at peace with him, much more, now that we are his friends, will we have salvation through his life; 
And not only so, but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with God. 
For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil: 
Because, till the law came, sin was in existence, but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken. 
But still death had power from Adam till Moses, even over those who had not done wrong like Adam, who is a picture of him who was to come. 
But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man. For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men. 
And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for theeffectofoneman'ssinwaspunishmentbythedecisionofGod, butthefreegivinghad power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number. 
For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life through the one, even Jesus Christ. 
So then, as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men. 
Because, as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man. 
And the law came in addition, to make wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more grace: 
That, as sin had power in death, so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.What may we say, then? are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace?
In no way. How may we, who are dead to sin, be living in it any longer? 
Or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into Christ Jesus, had baptism into his death?
We have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death: so that as Christ came again from the dead by the glory of the Father, we, in the same way, might be living in new life. 
For, if we have been made like him in his death, we will, in the same way, be like him in his coming to life again; 
Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away, and we might no longer be servants to sin. 
Because he who is dead is free from sin. 
But if we are dead with Christ, we have faith that we will be living with him; 
Having knowledge that because Christ has come back from the dead, he will never again go down to the dead; death has no more power over him. 
For his death was a death to sin, but his life now is a life which he is living to God. 
Even so see yourselves as dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus. 
For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death, so that you give way to its desires; 
And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God. 
For sin may not have rule over you: because you are not under law, but under grace. 
What then? are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace? Let it not be so.
Are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire? if to sin, the end being death, or if to do the desire of God, the end being righteousness. 
But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin, you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed;
And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness.
I am using words in the way of men, because your flesh is feeble: as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean, and to evil to do evil, so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy. 
When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness. 
What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you? for the end of such things is death. 
But now, being free from sin, and having been made servants to God, you have your fruit in that which is holy, and the end is eternal life. 
For the reward of sin is death; but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.Is it not clear, my brothers (I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law), that the law has power over a man as long as he is living? 
For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living; but if her husband is dead, she is free from the law of the husband. 
So if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband: but if the husband is dead, she is free from the law, so that she is not untrue, even if she takes another man. 
In the same way, my brothers, you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, even to him who came again from the dead, so that we might give fruit to God.
For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death. 
But now we are free from the law, having been made dead to that which had power over us; so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the letter. 
What then is to be said? is the law sin? in no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another's. 
But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead. 
And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death; 
And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death: 
For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law. 
But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good. 
Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil.
For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin. 
And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do. 
But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good. 
So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me. 
For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right. 
For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do. 
But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me. 
So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me. 
In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God, 
But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh. 
How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death? 
I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin.For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 
For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh: 
So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the way of the Spirit. 
For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh, but those who go in the way of the Spirit, to the things of the Spirit. 
For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace: 
Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be: 
So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God. 
You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his. 
And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death. 
So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh:
For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life. 
And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God. 
For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to you, by which we say, Abba, Father. 
The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God: 
And if we are children, we have a right to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way have a part in his glory. 
I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future. 
For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God. 
For every living thing was put under the power of change, not by its desire, but by him who made it so, in hope 
That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory. 
For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now. 
And not only so, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we have sorrow in our minds, waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons, that is, the salvation of our bodies. 
For our salvation is by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees? 
But if we have hope for that which we see not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it. 
And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say; 
And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God.
And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose. 
Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers: 
And those who were marked out by him were named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory. 
What may we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 
He who did not keep back his only Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things? 
Who will say anything against the saints of God? It is God who makes us clear from evil; 
Who will give a decision against us? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part. 
Who will come between us and the love of Christ? Will trouble, or pain, or cruel acts, or the need of food or of clothing, or danger, or the sword? 
As it is said in the holy Writings, Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready for destruction. 
But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love.
For I am certain that not death, or life, or angels, or rulers, or things present, or things to come, or powers, 
Or things on high, or things under the earth, or anything which is made, will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.I say what is true in Christ, and not what is false, my mind giving witness with me in the Holy Spirit, 
That I am full of sorrow and pain without end. 
For I have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers, my family in the flesh: 
Who are Israelites: who have the place of sons, and the glory, and the agreements with God, and the giving of the law, and the worship, and the hope offered by God: 
Whose are the fathers, and of whom came Christ in the flesh, who is over all, God, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it. 
But it is not as if the word of God was without effect. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel: 
And they are not all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, In Isaac will your seed be named. 
That is, it is not the children of the flesh, but the children of God's undertaking, who are named as the seed. 
For this is the word of God's undertaking, At this time will I come, and Sarah will have a son. 
And not only so, but Rebecca being about to have a child by our father Isaac — 
Before the children had come into existence, or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose and his selection might be effected, not by works, but by him whose purpose it is, 
It was said to her, The older will be the servant of the younger. 
Even as it is said, I had love for Jacob, but for Esau I had hate. 
What may we say then? is God not upright? let it not be said. 
For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and pity on whom I will have pity. 
So then, it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man, but by the mercy of God. 
For the holy Writings say to Pharaoh, For this same purpose did I put you on high, so that I might make my power seen in you, and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth. 
So then, at his pleasure he has mercy on a man, and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard. 
But you will say to me, Why does he still make us responsible? who is able to go against his purpose? 
But, O man, who are you, to make answer against God? May the thing which is made say to him who made it, Why did you make me so? 
Or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour, and out of another a vessel for shame? 
What if God, desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen, for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction: 
And to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy, which he had before made ready for glory, 
Even us, who were marked out by him, not only from the Jews, but from the Gentiles? 
As he says in Hosea, They will be named my people who were not my people, and she will be loved who was not loved. 
And in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there they will be named the sons of the living God. 
And Isaiah says about Israel, Even if the number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a small part will get salvation: 
For the Lord will give effect to his word on the earth, putting an end to it and cutting it short. 
And, as Isaiah had said before, If the Lord of armies had not given us a seed, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah. 
What then may we say? That the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith: 
But Israel, going after a law of righteousness, did not get it. 
Why? Because they were not searching for it by faith, but by works. They came up against the stone which was in the way; 
As it is said, See, I am putting in Zion a stone causing a fall, and a rock in the way: but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame.Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is, that they may get salvation. 
For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God, but not with knowledge. 
Because, not having knowledge of God's righteousness, and desiring to give effect to their righteousness, they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God. 
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith. 
For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it. 
But the righteousness which is of faith says these words, Say not in your heart, Who will go up to heaven? (that is, to make Christ come down:) 
Or, Who will go down into the deep? (that is, to make Christ come again from the dead:) 
But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of faith of which we are the preachers: 
Because, if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead, you will have salvation:
For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation. 
Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed. 
And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name: 
Because, Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation. 
But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith? and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news? and how will they have news without a preacher? 
And how will there be preachers if they are not sent? As it is said, How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things. 
But they have not all given ear to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has had faith in our word? 
So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. 
But I say, Did not the word come to their ears? Yes, certainly: Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. 
But I say, Had Israel no knowledge? First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry. 
And Isaiah says without fear, Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me; and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me. 
But about Israel he says; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away, and who put themselves against my word.So I say, Has God put his people on one side? Let there be no such thought. For I am of Israel, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
God has not put away the people of his selection. Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings? how he says words to God against Israel, 
Lord, they have put your prophets to death, and made waste your altars, and now I am the last, and they are searching for me to take away my life. 
But what answer does God make to him? I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal. 
In the same way, there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace. 
But if it is of grace, then it is no longer of works: or grace would not be grace. 
What then? That which Israel was searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard. 
As it was said in the holy Writings, God gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which have no hearing, to this day. 
And David says, Let their table be made a net for taking them, and a stone in their way, and a punishment:
Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see, and let their back be bent down at all times. 
So I say, Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall? In no way: but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that they might be moved to envy. 
Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will be the glory when they are made full? 
But I say to you, Gentiles, in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make much of my position:
If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy, so that some of them may get salvation by me. 
For, if by their putting away, the rest of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back again be, but life from the dead? 
And if the first-fruit is holy, so is the mass: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile, 
Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it is by the root that you are supported. 
You will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be put in. 
Truly, because they had no faith they were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not be lifted up in pride, but have fear; 
For, if God did not have mercy on the natural branches, he will not have mercy on you. 
See then that God is good but his rules are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will be cut off as they were. 
And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again.
For if you were cut out of a field olive-tree, and against the natural use were united to a good olive-tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be united again with the olive-tree which was theirs? 
For it is my desire, brothers, that this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles have come in; 
And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob: 
And this is my agreement with them, when I will take away their sins. 
As far as the good news is in question, they are cut off from God on account of you, but as far as the selection is in question, they are loved on account of the fathers. 
Because God's selection and his mercies may not be changed. 
For as you, in time past, were not under the rule of God, but now have got mercy through their turning away, 
So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God, so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy. 
For God has let them all go against his orders, so that he might have mercy on them all. 
O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions, and his ways may not be searched out. 
Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord? or who has taken part in his purposes? 
Or who has first given to him, and it will be given back to him again? 
For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it.For this reason I make request to you, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you will give your bodies as a living offering, holy, pleasing to God, which is the worship it is right for you to give him. 
And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God. 
But I say to every one of you, through the grace given to me, not to have an over-high opinion of himself, but to have wise thoughts, as God has given to every one a measure of faith. 
For, as we have a number of parts in one body, but all the parts have not the same use, 
So we, though we are a number of persons, are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another; 
And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith; 
Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it; 
He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy. 
Let love be without deceit. Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good. 
Be kind to one another with a brother's love, putting others before yourselves in honour; 
Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord's servants; 
Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer, 
Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses. 
Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you. 
Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing. 
Be in harmony with one another. Do not have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom. 
Do not give evil for evil to any man. Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men. 
As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men. 
Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the Lord. 
But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head. 
Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil by good.Let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers, because there is no power which is not of God, and all powers are ordered by God. 
For which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God: and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves. 
For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil. If you would have no fear of the authority, do good and you will have praise; 
For he is the servant of God to you for good. But if you doevil, havefear; fortheswordisnotinhishandfornothing: heisGod'sservant, making God's punishment come on the evil-doer. 
So put yourselves under the authority, not for fear of wrath, but because you have the knowledge of what is right. 
For the same reason, make payment of taxes; because the authority is God's servant, to take care of such things at all times. 
Give to all what is their right: taxes to him whose they are, payment to him whose right it is, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour is to be given. 
Be in debt for nothing, but to have love for one another: for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law. 
And this, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not put to death, Do not take what is another's, Do not have desire for what is another's, and if there is any other order, it is covered by this word, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. 
Love does no wrong to his neighbour, so love makes the law complete. 
See then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep: for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith. 
The night is far gone, and the day is near: so let us put off the works of the dark, arming ourselves with light, 
With right behaviour as in the day; not in pleasure-making and drinking, not in bad company and unclean behaviour, not in fighting and envy. 
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires.Do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith, and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings. 
One man has faith to take all things as food: another who is feeble in faith takes only green food. 
Let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not: and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does; for he has God's approval. 
Who are you to make yourself a judge of another man's servant? it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad. Yes, his place will be safe, because the Lord is able to keep him from falling. 
This man puts one day before another: to that man they are the same. Let every man be certain in his mind. 
He who keeps the day, keeps it to the Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it not, and gives praise to God. 
For every man's life and every man's death has a relation to others as well as to himself. 
As long as we have life we are living to the Lord; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord; so if we are living, or if our life comes to an end, we are the Lord's. 
And for this purpose Christ went into death and came back again, that he might be the Lord of the dead and of the living. 
But you, why do you make yourself your brother's judge? or again, why have you no respect for your brother? because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge. 
For it is said in the holy Writings, By my life, says the Lord, to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue will give worship to God. 
So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God. 
Then let us not be judges of one another any longer: but keep this in mind, that no man is to make it hard for his brother, or give him cause for doubting. 
I am conscious of this, and am certain in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean, for him it is unclean. 
And if because of food your brother is troubled, then you are no longer going on in the way of love. Do not let your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death. 
Let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good: 
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
And he who in these things is Christ's servant, is pleasing to God and has the approval of men. 
So then, let us go after the things which make peace, and the things by which we may be a help to one another. 
Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food. All things are certainly clean; but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another. 
It is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother. 
The faith which you have, have it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval. 
But he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food, because he does it not in faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.We who are strong have to be a support to the feeble, and not give pleasure to ourselves. 
Let every one of us give pleasure to his neighbour for his good, to make him strong. 
For Christ did not give pleasure to himself, but, as it is said, The bitter words of those who were angry with you came on me. 
Now those things which were put down in writing before our time were for our learning, so that through quiet waiting and through the comfort of the holy Writings we might have hope. 
Now may the God who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with Christ Jesus: 
So that with one mouth you may give glory to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
So then, take one another to your hearts, as Christ took us, to the glory of God. 
Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by God to the fathers, 
And so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercy; as it is said, For this reason I will give praise to you among the Gentiles, and I will make a song to your name. 
And again he says, Take part, you Gentiles, in the joy of his people. 
And again, Give praise to the Lord, all you Gentiles; and let all the nations give praise to him. 
And again Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, and he who comes to be the ruler over the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles put their hope. 
Now may the God of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith, so that all hope may be yours in the power of the Holy Spirit.
And I myself am certain of you, brothers, that you are full of what is good, complete in all knowledge, able to give direction to one another. 
But I have, in some measure, less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again, because of the grace which was given to me by God, 
To be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, doing the work of a priest in the good news of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be pleasing to God, being made holy by the Holy Spirit. 
So I have pride in Christ Jesus in the things which are God's. 
And I will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the Gentiles under his rule in word and in act, 
By signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have given all the good news of Christ; 
Making it my purpose not to take the good news where Christ was named, so that my work might not be resting on that of others; 
But as it is said in the holy Writings, They will see, to whom the news of him had not been given, and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge. 
For which reason I was frequently kept from coming to you: 
But now, having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you, 
Whenever I go to Spain (for it is my hope to see you on my way, and to be sent on there by you, if first I may in some measure have been comforted by your company) — 
But now I go to Jerusalem, taking help for the saints.
For it has been the good pleasure of those of Macedonia and Achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem. 
Yes, it has been their good pleasure; and they are in their debt. For if the Gentiles have had a part in the things of the Spirit which were theirs, it is right for them, in the same way, to give them help in the things of the flesh. 
So when I have done this, and have given them this fruit of love, I will go on by you into Spain. 
And I am certain that when I come, I will be full of the blessing of Christ. 
Now I make request to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you will be working together with me in your prayers to God for me; 
So that I may be kept safe from those in Judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of God, and that the help which I am taking for Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints; 
So that I may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of God, and have rest with you. 
Now may the God of peace be with you all. So be it.It is my desire to say a good word for Phoebe, who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae: 
That you will take her in kindly, after the way of the saints, as one who is the Lord's, and give her help in anything in which she may have need of you: because she has been a help to a great number and to myself. 
Give my love to Prisca and Aquila, workers with me in Christ Jesus, 
Who for my life put their necks in danger; to whom not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are in debt: 
And say a kind word to the church which is in their house. Give my love to my dear Epaenetus, who is the first fruit of Asia to Christ. 
Give my love to Mary, who gave much care to you. 
Give my love to Andronicus and Junia, my relations, who were in prison with me, who are noted among the Apostles, and who were in Christ before me. 
Give my love to Ampliatus, who is dear to me in the Lord, 
Give my love to Urbanus, a worker in Christ with us, and to my dear Stachys. 
Give my love to Apelles, who has the approval of Christ. Say a kind word to those who are of the house of Aristobulus. 
Give my love to Herodion, my relation. Say a kind word to those of the house of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. 
Give my love to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Give my love to my dear Persis, who did much work in the Lord. 
Give my love to Rufus, one of the Lord's selection, and to his mother and mine. 
Give my love to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them. 
Give my love to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 
Give one another a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their love to you. 
Now, it is my desire, brothers, that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you, quite against the teaching which was given to you: and keep away from them. 
For such people are not servants of the Lord Christ, but of their stomachs; and by their smooth and well-said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked. 
For all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered. For this reason I have joy in you, but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good, and without knowledge of evil.
And the God of peace will be crushing Satan under your feet before long. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
Timothy, who is working with me, sends his love to you, so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my relations. 
I, Tertius, who have done the writing of this letter, send love in the Lord. 
Gaius, with whom I am living, whose house is open to all the church, sends his love, so does Erastus, the manager of the accounts of the town, and Quartus, the brother. 
[] 
Now to him who is able to make you strong in agreement with the good news which I gave you and the preaching of Jesus Christ, in the light of the revelation of that secret which has been kept through times eternal,
But is now made clear; and by the writings of the prophets, by the order of the eternal God, the knowledge of it has been given to all the nations, so that they may come under the rule of the faith; 
To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory for ever. So be it.Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been made holy in Christ Jesus, saints by the selection of God, with all those who in every place give honour to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I give praise to my God for you at all times, because of the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ Jesus; 
So that in him you have wealth in all things, in word and in knowledge of every sort; 
Even as the witness of the Christ has been made certain among you: 
So that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
Who will give you strength to the end, to be free from all sin in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
God is true, through whom you have been given a part with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Now I make request to you, my brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you will all say the same thing, and that there may be no divisions among you, so that you may be in complete agreement, in the same mind and in the same opinion. 
Because it has come to my knowledge, through those of the house of Chloe, that there are divisions among you, my brothers. 
That is, that some of you say, I am of Paul; some say, I am of Apollos; some say, I am of Cephas; and some say, I am Christ's. 
Is there a division in Christ? was Paul nailed to the cross for you? or were you given baptism in the name of Paul? 
I give praise to God that not one of you had baptism from me, but Crispus and Gaius; 
So that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name. 
And I gave baptism to the house of Stephanas; but I am not certain that any others had baptism from me.
For Christ sent me, not to give baptism, but to be a preacher of the good news: not with wise words, for fear that the cross of Christ might be made of no value. 
For the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction; but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of God. 
As it says in the holy Writings, I will put an end to the wisdom of the wise, and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge. 
Where is the wise? where is he who has knowledge of the law? where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 
For because, by the purpose of God, the world, with all its wisdom, had not the knowledge of God, it was God's pleasure, by so foolish a thing as preaching, to give salvation to those who had faith in him. 
Seeing that the Jews make request for signs, and the Greeks are looking for knowledge: 
But we give the good news of Christ on the cross, a hard thing to the Jews, and a foolish thing to the Gentiles; 
But to those of God's selection, Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power and the wisdom of God. 
Because what seems foolish in God is wiser than men; and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men. 
For you see God's design for you, my brothers, that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh, not the strong, not the noble: 
But God made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame; and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong; 
And the low things of the world, and the things without honour, did God make selection of, yes, even the things which are not, so that he might make as nothing the things which are: 
So that no flesh might have glory before God. 
But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus, through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation, and made us holy: 
So that, as it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord.And when I came to you, my brothers, I did not come with wise words of knowledge, putting before you the secret of God. 
For I had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of Jesus Christ on the cross. 
And I was with you without strength, in fear and in doubt. 
And in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom, but I was dependent on the power of the Spirit to make it clear to you: 
So that your faith might be based not on man's wisdom but on the power of God. 
But still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge, though not the wisdom of this world, and not of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing: 
But we give the news of the secret wisdom of God, which he had kept in store before the world came into existence, for our glory; 
Of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge: for if they had, they would not have put the Lord of glory on the cross: 
But as it says in the holy Writings, Things which the eye saw not, and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man, such things as God has made ready for those who have love for him.
But God has given us the revelation of these things through his Spirit, for the Spirit makes search into all things, even the deep things of God. 
For who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him? in the same way, no one has knowledge of the things of God but the Spirit of God. 
But we have not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes from God, so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by God. 
And these are the things which we say, not in the language of man's wisdom, but in words given to us by the Spirit, judging the things of the spirit by the help of the Spirit. 
For the natural man is not able to take in the things of the Spirit of God: for they seem foolish to him, and he is not able to have knowledge of them, because such knowledge comes only through the Spirit. 
But he who has the Spirit, though judging all things, is himself judged by no one. 
For who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord, so as to be his teacher? But we have the mind of Christ.And the teaching I gave you, my brothers, was such as I was able to give, not to those who have the Spirit, but to those who are still in the flesh, even to children in Christ.
I gave you milk and not meat, because you were, then, unable to take it, and even now you are not able; 
Because you are still in the flesh: for when there is envy and division among you, are you not still walking after the way of the flesh, even as natural men?
For when one says, I am of Paul; and another says, I am of Apollos; are you not talking like natural men? 
What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them. 
I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave the increase. 
So then the planter is nothing, and the waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase. 
Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end: but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work.
For we are workers with God: you are God's planting, God's building.
In the measure of the grace given to me, I, as a wise master-builder, have put the base in position, and another goes on building on it. But let every man take care what he puts on it. 
For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ. 
But on the base a man may put gold, silver, stones of great price, wood, dry grass, cut stems; 
Every man's work will be made clear in that day, because it will be tested by fire; and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every man's work. 
If any man's work comes through the test, he will have a reward. 
If the fire puts an end to any man's work, it will be his loss: but he will get salvation himself, though as by fire.
Do you not see that you are God's holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you? 
If anyone makes the house of God unclean, God will put an end to him; for the house of God is holy, and you are his house. 
Let no man have a false idea. If any man seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.
For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God. As it is said in the holy Writings, He who takes the wise in their secret designs: 
And again, The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise, that they are nothing. 
So let no one take pride in men. For all things are yours; 
Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.Let us be judged as servants of Christ, and as those who are responsible for the secret things of God. 
And it is right for such servants to be safe persons. 
But it is a small thing to me that I am judged by you or by man's judging; I am not even a judge of myself. 
For I am not conscious of any wrong in myself; but this does not make me clear, for it is the Lord who is my judge. 
For this reason let there be no judging before the time, till the Lord comes, who will make clear the secret things of the dark, and the designs of the heart; and then will every man have his praise from God. 
My brothers, it is because of you that I have taken Apollos and myself as examples of these things, so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy Writings, so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother. 
For who made you better than your brother? or what have you that has not been given to you? but if it has been given to you, what cause have you for pride, as if it had not been given to you? 
For even now you are full, even now you have wealth, you have been made kings without us: truly, I would be glad if you were kings, so that we might be kings with you. 
For it seems to me that God has put us the Apostles last of all, as men whose fate is death: for we are put on view to the world, and to angels, and to men. 
We are made to seem foolish for Christ, but you are wise in Christ; we are feeble, but you are strong; you have glory, but we have shame. 
Even to this hour we are without food, drink, and clothing, we are given blows and have no certain resting-place; 
And with our hands we do the hardest work: when they give us curses we give blessings, when we undergo punishment we take it quietly; 
When evil things are said about us we give gentle answers: we are made as the unclean things of the world, as that for which no one has any use, even till now. 
I am not saying these things to put you to shame, but so that, as my dear children, you may see what is right. 
For even if you had ten thousand teachers in Christ, you have not more than one father: for in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news. 
So my desire is that you take me as your example. 
For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and true child in the Lord; he will make clear to you my ways in Christ, even as I am teaching everywhere in every church. 
Now some are full of pride, as if I was not coming to you. 
But I will come to you in a short time, if it is pleasing to the Lord, and I will take note, not of the word of those who are full of pride, but of the power. 
For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. 
What is your desire? is my coming to be with punishment, or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit?It is said, in fact, that there is among you a sin of the flesh, such as is not seen even among the Gentiles, that one of you has his father's wife. 
And in place of feeling sorrow, you are pleased with yourselves, so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you. 
For I myself, being present in spirit though not in body, have come to a decision about him who has done this thing; 
In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you have come together with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
That this man is to be handed over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
This pride of yours is not good. Do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass? 
Take away, then, the old leaven, so that you may be a new mass, even as you are without leaven. For Christ has been put to death as our Passover. 
Let us then keep the feast, not with old leaven, and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts, but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings. 
In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh; 
But I had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church, or those who have a desire for and take the property of others, or those who give worship to images; for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely: 
But the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh, or had the desire for other people's property, or was in the way of using violent language, or being the worse for drink, or took by force what was not his, you might not keep company with such a one, or take food with him. 
For it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside; but it is yours to be judging those who are among you;
As for those who are outside, God is their judge. So put away the evil man from among you.How is it, that if any one of you has a cause at law against another, he takes it before a Gentile judge and not before the saints? 
Is it not certain that the saints will be the judges of the world? if then the world will be judged by you, are you unable to give a decision about the smallest things? 
Is it not certain that we are to be the judges of angels? how much more then of the things of this life? 
If then there are questions to be judged in connection with the things of this life, why do you put them in the hands of those who have no position in the church? 
I say this to put you to shame. Is there not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between his brothers? 
But a brother who has a cause at law against another takes it before Gentile judges. 
More than this, it is not to your credit to have causes at law with one another at all. Why not put up with wrong? why not undergo loss? 
So far from doing this, you yourselves do wrong and take your brothers' property. 
Have you not knowledge that evil-doers will have no part in the kingdom of God? Have no false ideas about this: no one who goes after the desires of the flesh, or gives worship to images, or is untrue when married, or is less than a man, or makes a wrong use of men, 
Or is a thief, or the worse for drink, or makes use of strong language, or takes by force what is not his, will have any part in the kingdom of God. 
And such were some of you; but you have been washed, you have been made holy, you have been given righteousness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. 
I am free to do all things; but not all things are wise. I am free to do all things; but I will not let myself come under the power of any. 
Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will put an end to them together. But the body is not for the desires of the flesh, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: 
And God who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power. 
Do you not see that your bodies are part of the body of Christ? how then may I take what is a part of the body of Christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman? such a thing may not be. 
Or do you not see that he who is joined to a loose woman is one body with her? for God has said, The two of them will become one flesh. 
But he who is united to the Lord is one spirit. 
Keep away from the desires of the flesh. Every sin which a man does is outside of the body; but he who goes after the desires of the flesh does evil to his body. 
Or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the Holy Spirit which is in you, and which has been given to you by God? and you are not the owners of yourselves; 
For a payment has been made for you: let God be honoured in your body.Now, as to the things in your letter to me: It is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman. 
But because of the desires of the flesh, let every man have his wife, and every woman her husband. 
Let the husband give to the wife what is right; and let the wife do the same to the husband. 
The wife has not power over her body, but the husband; and in the same way the husband has not power over his body, but the wife. 
Do not keep back from one another what is right, but only for a short time, and by agreement, so that you may give yourselves to prayer, and come together again; so that Satan may not get the better of you through your loss of self-control. 
But this I say as my opinion, and not as an order of the Lord. 
It is my desire that all men might be even as I am. But every man has the power of his special way of life given him by God, one in this way and one in that. 
But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them to be even as I am. 
But if they have not self-control let them get married; for married life is better than the burning of desire. 
But to the married I give orders, though not I but the Lord, that the wife may not go away from her husband
(Or if she goes away from him, let her keep unmarried, or be united to her husband again); and that the husband may not go away from his wife. 
But to the rest I say, and not the Lord; If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian, and it is her desire to go on living with him, let him not go away from her. 
And if a woman has a husband who is not a Christian, and it is his desire to go on living with her, let her not go away from her husband. 
For the husband who has not faith is made holy through his Christian wife, and the wife who is not a Christian is made holy through the brother: if not, your children would be unholy, but now are they holy. 
But if the one who is not a Christian has a desire to go away, let it be so: the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other: but it is God's pleasure that we may be at peace with one another. 
For how may you be certain, O wife, that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband? or you, O husband, that you may not do the same for your wife? 
Only, as the Lord has given to a man, and as is the purpose of God for him, so let him go on living. And these are my orders for all the churches. 
If any man who is a Christian has had circumcision, let him keep so; and if any man who is a Christian has not had circumcision, let him make no change. 
Circumcision is nothing, and its opposite is nothing, but only doing the orders of God is of value. 
Let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by God. 
If you were a servant when you became a Christian, let it not be a grief to you; but if you have a chance to become free, make use of it. 
For he who was a servant when he became a Christian is the Lord's free man; and he who was free when he became a Christian is the Lord's servant. 
It is the Lord who has made payment for you: be not servants of men. 
My brothers, let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of God for him. 
Now about virgins I have no orders from the Lord: but I give my opinion as one to whom the Lord has given mercy to be true to him. 
In my opinion then, because of the present trouble, it is good for a man to keep as he is. 
If you are married to a wife, make no attempt to get free from her: if you are free from a wife, do not take a wife. 
If you get married it is not a sin; and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin. But those who do so will have trouble in the flesh. But I will not be hard on you. 
But I say this, my brothers, the time is short; and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not; 
And for those who are in sorrow, to give no signs of it; and for those who are glad, to give no signs of joy; and for those who are getting property, to be as if they had nothing; 
And for those who make use of the world, not to be using it fully; for this world's way of life will quickly come to an end. 
But it is my desire for you to be free from cares. The unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the Lord, how he may give pleasure to the Lord: 
But the married man gives his attention to the things of this world, how he may give pleasure to his wife. 
And the wife is not the same as the virgin. The virgin gives her mind to the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and in spirit: but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world, how she may give pleasure to her husband. 
Now I say this for your profit; not to make things hard for you, but because of what is right, and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord. 
But if, in any man's opinion, he is not doing what is right for his virgin, if she is past her best years, and there is need for it, let him do what seems right to him; it is no sin; let them be married. 
But the man who is strong in mind and purpose, who is not forced but has control over his desires, does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin. 
So then, he who gets married to his virgin does well, and he who keeps her unmarried does better. 
It is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living; but when her husband is dead, she is free to be married to another; but only to a Christian. 
But it will be better for her to keep as she is, in my opinion: and it seems to me that I have the Spirit of God.Now about things offered to images: we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge. Knowledge gives pride, but love gives true strength. 
If anyone seems to himself to have knowledge, so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything; 
But if anyone has love for God, God has knowledge of him. 
So, then, as to the question of taking food offered to images, we are certain that an image is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. 
For though there are those who have the name of gods, in heaven or on earth, as there are a number of gods and a number of lords, 
There is for us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we are for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we have our being through him. 
Still, all men have not that knowledge: but some, being used till now to the image, are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image; and because they are not strong in the faith, their minds are troubled. 
But God's approval of us is not based on the food we take: if we do not take it we are no worse for it; and if we take it we are no better. 
But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble. 
For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, taking food as a guest in the house of an image, will it not give him, if he is feeble, the idea that he may take food offered to images? 
And so, through your knowledge, you are the cause of destruction to your brother, for whom Christ underwent death. 
And in this way, doing evil to the brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are sinning against Christ. 
For this reason, if food is a cause of trouble to my brother, I will give up taking meat for ever, so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother.Am I not free? am I not an Apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are you not my work in the Lord? 
If to others I am not an Apostle, at least I am one to you: for the fact that you are Christians is the sign that I am an Apostle. 
My answer to those who are judging me is this. 
Have we no right to take food and drink? 
Have we no right to take about with us a Christian wife, like the rest of the Apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? 
Or I only and Barnabas, have we no right to take a rest from work? 
Who ever goes to war without looking to someone to be responsible for his payment? who puts in vines and does not take the fruit of them? or who takes care of sheep without drinking of their milk? 
Am I talking as a man? does not the law say the same? 
For it says in the law of Moses, It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it. Is it for the oxen that God is giving orders? 
Or has he us in mind? Yes, it was said for us; because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope, and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it. 
If we have been planting the things of the Spirit for you, does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world? 
If others have a part in this right over you, have we not even more? But we did not make use of our right, so that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of Christ. 
Do you not see that the servants of the holy things get their living from the Temple, and the servants of the altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar? 
Even so did the Lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news. 
But I have not made use of any of these things: and I am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me: for it would be better for me to undergo death, than for any man to make this pride of mine of no effect. 
For if I am a preacher of the good news, I have no cause for pride in this; because I am forced to do so, for a curse is on me if I do not. 
But if I do it gladly, I have a reward; and if not, I am under orders to do it. 
What then is my reward? This, that when I am giving the good news, I may give it without payment, not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news. 
For though I was free from all men, I made myself a servant to all, so that more might have salvation. 
And to the Jews I was as a Jew, so that I might give the good news to them; to those under the law I was the same, not as being myself under the law, but so that I might give the good news to those under the law. 
To those without the law I was as one without the law, not as being without law to God, but as under law to Christ, so that I might give the good news to those without the law. 
To the feeble, I was as one who is feeble, so that they might have salvation: I have been all things to all men, so that some at least might have salvation. 
And I do all things for the cause of the good news, so that I may have a part in it. 
Do you not see that in a running competition all take part, but only one gets the reward? So let your minds be fixed on the reward. 
And every man who takes part in the sports has self-control in all things. Now they do it to get a crown which is of this world, but we for an eternal crown. 
So then I am running, not uncertainly; so I am fighting, not as one who gives blows in the air: 
But I give blows to my body, and keep it under control, for fear that, after having given the good news to others, I myself might not have God's approval.For it is my desire, my brothers, that you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud, and they all went through the sea; 
And they all had baptism from Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
And they all took the same holy food; 
And the same holy drink: for they all took of the water from the holy rock which came after them: and the rock was Christ. 
But with most of them God was not pleased: for they came to their end in the waste land. 
Now these things were for an example to us, so that our hearts might not go after evil things, as they did. 
Then do not go after false gods, as some of them did; as it is said in the holy Writings, After resting and feasting, the people got up to take their pleasure. 
Again, let us not give way to the desires of the flesh, as some of them did, of whom twenty-three thousand came to their end in one day. 
And let us not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did, and came to their death by snakes. 
And do not say evil things against the Lord, as some of them did, and destruction overtook them. 
Now these things were done as an example; and were put down in writing for our teaching, on whom the last days have come. 
So let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall. 
You have been put to no test but such as is common to man: and God is true, who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo; but he will make with the test a way out of it, so that you may be able to go through it.
For this cause, my dear brothers, give no worship to false gods.
What I am saying is for wise men, do you be the judges of it. 
The cup of blessing which we take, does it not give us a part in the blood of Christ? and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of Christ? 
Because we, being a number of persons, are one bread, we are one body: for we all take part in the one bread. 
See Israel after the flesh: do not those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the altar? 
Do I say, then, that what is offered to images is anything, or that the image is anything? 
What I say is that the things offered by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God; and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits. 
It is not possible for you, at the same time, to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits; you may not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits. 
Or may we be the cause of envy to the Lord? are we stronger than he? 
We are free to do all things, but there are things which it is not wise to do. We are free to do all things, but not all things are for the common good. 
Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself, but equally to his neighbour's good. 
Whatever meat may be had at the public market, take as food without question of right or wrong; 
For the earth is the Lord's and all things in it. 
If a Gentile makes a feast for you, and you are pleased to go as a guest, take whatever is put before you, without question of right or wrong. 
But if anyone says to you, This food has been used as an offering, do not take it, on account of him who said it, and on account of his sense of right and wrong: 
Right and wrong, I say, not for you, but for the other man; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another man's sense of right or wrong. 
But if I give praise to God for the food which I take, let no man say evil of me for that reason. 
So then, if it is a question of food or drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 
Give no cause of trouble to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God. 
Even as I give way to all men in all things, not looking for profit for myself, but for the good of others, that they may get salvation.So take me for your example, even as I take Christ for mine.
Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things, and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you. 
But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. 
Every man who takes part in prayer, or gives teaching as a prophet, with his head covered, puts shame on his head. 
But every woman who does so with her head unveiled, puts shame on her head: for it is the same as if her hair was cut off. 
For if a woman is not veiled, let her hair be cut off; but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off, let her be veiled. 
For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
For the man did not come from the woman, but the woman from the man. 
And the man was not made for the woman, but the woman for the man. 
For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 
But the woman is not separate from the man, and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord. 
For as the woman is from the man, so the man is through the woman; but all things are from God. 
Be judges yourselves of the question: does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled? 
Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair, it is a cause of shame to him? 
But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering. 
But if any man will not be ruled in this question, this is not our way of doing things, and it is not done in the churches of God. 
But in giving you this order, there is one thing about which I am not pleased: it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. 
For first of all, it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and I take the statement to be true in part. 
For divisions are necessary among you, in order that those who have God's approval may be clearly seen among you. 
But now, when you come together, it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord: 
For when you take your food, everyone takes his meal before the other; and one has not enough food, and another is the worse for drink. 
What? have you not houses to take your meals in? or have you no respect for the church of God, putting the poor to shame? What am I to say to you? am I to give you praise? certainly not. 
For it was handed down to me from the Lord, as I gave it to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when Judas was false to him, took bread, 
And when it had been broken with an act of praise, he said, This is my body which is for you: do this in memory of me. 
In the same way, with the cup, after the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this, whenever you take it, in memory of me. 
For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes. 
If, then, anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord. 
But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself. 
For a man puts himself in danger, if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lord's body. 
For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill, and a number are dead. 
But if we were true judges of ourselves, punishment would not come on us. 
But if punishment does come, it is sent by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged. 
So then, my brothers, when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one another. 
If any man is in need of food, let him take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come.But about the things of the spirit, my brothers, it is not right for you to be without teaching. 
You are conscious that when you were Gentiles, in whatever way you were guided, you went after images without voice or power. 
So it is my desire for you to be clear about this; that no one is able to say by the Spirit of God that Jesus is cursed; and no one is able to say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.
Now there are different qualities given to men, but the same Spirit. 
And there are different sorts of servants, but the same Lord. 
And there are different operations, but the same God, who is working all things in all. 
But to every man some form of the Spirit's working is given for the common good.
For to one are given words of wisdom through the Spirit; and to another words of knowledge through the same Spirit: 
To another faith in the same Spirit; and to another the power of taking away disease, by the one Spirit;
And to another the power of working wonders; and to another the prophet's word; and to another the power of testing spirits; to another different sorts of tongues; and to another the power of making clear the sense of the tongues: 
But all these are the operations of the one and the same Spirit, giving to every man separately as his pleasure is. 
For as the body is one, and has a number of parts, and all the parts make one body, so is Christ. 
For through the baptism of the one Spirit we were all formed into one body, Jews or Greeks, servants or free men, and were all made full of the same Spirit.
For the body is not one part, but a number of parts.
If the foot says, Because I am not the hand, I am not a part of the body; it is no less a part of the body. 
And if the ear says, Because I am not the eye, I am not a part of the body; it is a part of the body all the same. 
If all the body was an eye, where would be the hearing? if all was hearing, where would be the smelling? 
But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him. 
And if they were all one part, where would the body be? 
But now they are all different parts, but one body. 
And the eye may not say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
No, those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary; 
And to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour; and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect; 
But those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care: and so the body has been joined together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it; 
So that there might be no division in the body; but all the parts might have the same care for one another. 
And if there is pain in one part of the body, all the parts will be feeling it; or if one part is honoured, all the parts will be glad. 
Now you are the body of Christ, and every one of you the separate parts of it. 
And God has put some in the church, first, Apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those with wonder- working powers, then those with the power of taking away disease, helpers, wise guides, users of strange tongues. 
Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all the power of working wonders? 
Are all able to take away disease? have all the power of tongues? are all able to give their sense? 
But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit. And now I am pointing out to you an even better way.If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am like sounding brass, or a loud-tongued bell.
And if I have a prophet's power, and have knowledge of all secret things; and if I have all faith, by which mountains may be moved from their place, but have not love, I am nothing. 
And if I give all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it is of no profit to me. 
Love is never tired of waiting; love is kind; love has no envy; love has no high opinion of itself, love has no pride; 
Love's ways are ever fair, it takes no thought for itself; it is not quickly made angry, it takes no account of evil; 
It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, but has joy in what is true; 
Love has the power of undergoing all things, having faith in all things, hoping all things. 
Though the prophet's word may come to an end, tongues come to nothing, and knowledge have no more value, love has no end. 
For our knowledge is only in part, and the prophet's word gives only a part of what is true: 
But when that which is complete is come, then that which is in part will be no longer necessary. 
When I was a child, I made use of a child's language, I had a child's feelings and a child's thoughts: now that I am a man, I have put away the things of a child. 
For now we see things in a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now my knowledge is in part; then it will be complete, even as God's knowledge of me. 
But now we still have faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.Go after love; still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives, but most of all that you may have the prophet's power. 
For he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to God; because no one has the sense of what he is saying; but in the Spirit he is talking of secret things. 
But the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength. 
He who makes use of tongues may do good to himself; but he who gives the prophet's word does good to the church. 
Now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues, it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophet's word from you; for this is a greater thing than using tongues, if the sense is not given at the same time, for the good of the church. 
But, now, my brothers, if I come to you using tongues, what profit will it be to you, if I do not give you a revelation, or knowledge, or the word of the prophet, or teaching? 
Even things without life, having a voice, such as a music-pipe or other instrument, if they do not give out different sounds, who may be certain what is being played? 
For if the war-horn gives out an uncertain note, who will get ready for the fight? 
So if you, in using a strange tongue, say words which have no sense, how will anyone take in what you are saying? for you will be talking to the air. 
There are, it may be, a number of different voices in the world, and no voice is without sense. 
But if the sense of the voice is not clear to me, I am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking, and he will be the same to me. 
So if you are desiring the things which the Spirit gives, let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church. 
For this reason, let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may, at the same time, be able to give the sense.
For if I make use of tongues in my prayers, my spirit makes the prayer, but not my mind. 
What then? let my prayer be from the spirit, and equally from the mind; let my song be from the spirit, and equally from mind. 
For if you give a blessing with the spirit, how will the man who has no knowledge say, So be it, after your prayer, seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying? 
For your giving of the blessing is certainly well done, but of no profit to the man without knowledge. 
I give praise to God that I am able to make use of tongues more than you all: 
But in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear, so that others might have profit, than ten thousand words in a strange tongue. 
My brothers, do not be children in mind: in evil be as little children, but in mind be of full growth. 
In the law it is said, By men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people; and not even so will they give ear to me, says the Lord. 
For this reason tongues are for a sign, not to those who have faith, but to those who have not: but the prophet's word is for those who have faith, and not for the rest who have not. 
If, then, the church has come together, and all are using tongues, and there come in men without knowledge or faith, will they not say that you are unbalanced? 
But if all are teaching as prophets, and a man without faith or knowledge comes in, he is tested by all, he is judged by all; 
The secrets of his heart are made clear; and he will go down on his face and give worship to God, saying that God is truly among you. 
What is it then, my brothers? when you come together everyone has a holy song, or a revelation, or a tongue, or is giving the sense of it. Let everything be done for the common good. 
If any man makes use of a tongue, let it not be more than two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let someone give the sense: 
But if there is no one to give the sense, let him keep quiet in the church; and let his words be to himself and to God. 
And let the prophets give their words, but not more than two or three, and let the others be judges of what they say. 
But if a revelation is given to another who is seated near, let the first be quiet. 
For you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort; 
And the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets; 
For God is not a God whose ways are without order, but a God of peace; as in all the churches of the saints. 
Let women keep quiet in the churches: for it is not right for them to be talking; but let them be under control, as it says in the law. 
And if they have a desire for knowledge about anything, let them put questions to their husbands privately: for talking in the church puts shame on a woman.
What? was it from you that the word of God went out? or did it only come in to you?
If any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the Spirit, let him take note of the things which I am writing to you, as being the word of the Lord. 
But if any man is without knowledge, let him be so. 
So then, my brothers, let it be your chief desire to be prophets; but let no one be stopped from using tongues. 
Let all things be done in the right and ordered way.Now I am going to make clear to you, my brothers, what the good news was which I gave to you, and which you took, and on which your faith is based, 
By which you have salvation; that is to say, the form in which it was given to you, if it is fixed in your minds, and if your faith in it is not without effect. 
For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says in the Writings; 
And he was put in the place of the dead; and on the third day he came back from the dead, as it says in the Writings; 
And he was seen by Cephas; then by the twelve; 
Then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, but some are sleeping; 
Then he was seen by James; then by all the Apostles. 
And last of all, as by one whose birth was out of the right time, he was seen by me. 
For I am the least of the Apostles, having no right to be named an Apostle, because of my cruel attacks on the church of God. 
But by the grace of God, I am what I am: and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing; for I did more work than all of them; though not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
If then it is I who am the preacher, or they, this is our word, and to this you have given your faith. 
Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead? 
But if there is no coming back from the dead, then Christ has not come back from the dead: 
And if Christ did not come again from the dead, then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect. 
Yes, and we are seen to be false witnesses of God; because we gave witness of God that by his power Christ came again from the dead: which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead. 
For if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again, then Christ has not come to life again: 
And if that is so, your faith is of no effect; you are still in your sins. 
And, in addition, the dead in Christ have gone to destruction. 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most unhappy. 
But now Christ has truly come back from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are sleeping. 
For as by man came death, so by man there is a coming back from the dead. 
For as in Adam death comes to all, so in Christ will all come back to life.
But every man in his right order: Christ the first-fruits; then those who are Christ's at his coming. 
Then comes the end, when he will give up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power. 
For his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet. 
The last power to come to an end is death. 
For, as it says, He has put all things under his feet. But when he says, All things are put under him, it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him. 
And when all things have been put under him, then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him, so that God may be all in all. 
Again, what will they do who are given baptism for the dead? if the dead do not come back at all, why are people given baptism for them? 
And why are we in danger every hour? 
Yes, truly, by your pride in me, my brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord, my life is one long death. 
If, after the way of men, I was fighting with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not come to life again, let us take our pleasure in feasting, for tomorrow we come to an end. 
Do not be tricked by false words: evil company does damage to good behaviour. 
Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I say this to put you to shame. 
But someone will say, How do the dead come back? and with what sort of body do they come? 
Foolish man, it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again: 
And when you put it into the earth, you do not put in the body which it will be, but only the seed, of grain or some other sort of plant; 
But God gives it a body, as it is pleasing to him, and to every seed its special body. 
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes. 
And there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth, but the glory of the one is different from that of the other. 
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for the glory of one star is different from that of another. 
So is it with the coming back from the dead. It is planted in death; it comes again in life: 
It is planted in shame; it comes again in glory: feeble when it is planted, it comes again in power: 
It is planted a natural body; it comes again as a body of the spirit. If there is a natural body, there is equally a body of the spirit. 
And so it is said, The first man Adam was a living soul. The last Adam is a life-giving spirit. 
But that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit. 
The first man is from the earth, and of the earth: the second man is from heaven. 
Those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth: and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven. 
And in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth, so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven. 
Now I say this, my brothers, that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God; and death may not have a part in life. 
See, I am giving you the revelation of a secret: we will not all come to the sleep of death, but we will all be changed. 
In a second, in the shutting of an eye, at the sound of the last horn: for at that sound the dead will come again, free for ever from the power of death, and we will be changed. 
For this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death, and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life. 
But when this has taken place, then that which was said in the Writings will come true, Death is overcome by life. 
O death, where is your power? O death, where are your pains? 
The pain of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law: 
But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
For this cause, my dear brothers, be strong in purpose and unmoved, ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord, because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord.Now about the giving of money for the saints, as I gave orders to the churches of Galatia, so do you. 
On the first day of the week, let every one of you put by him in store, in measure as he has done well in business, so that it may not be necessary to get money together when I come. 
And when I come, I will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to Jerusalem. 
And if it is possible for me to go there, they will go with me. 
But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia, for that is my purpose; 
But I may be with you for a time, or even for the winter, so that you may see me on my way, wherever I go. 
For it is not my desire to see you now, on my way; because it is my hope to be with you for some time, if that is the Lord's pleasure. 
But I will be at Ephesus till Pentecost; 
For a great and important door there is open to me, and there are a number of people against me. 
Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; because he is doing the Lord's work, even as I am: 
See then that he has the honour which is right. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me: for I am looking for him with the brothers. 
But as for Apollos, the brother, I had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not his pleasure to come now; but he will come when he has a chance. 
Be on the watch, unmoved in the faith, and be strong like men. 
Let all you do be done in love. 
Now I make my request to you, my brothers, for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints, 
That you put yourselves under such, and under everyone who is helping the Lord's work. 
And I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for they have done what was needed to make your work complete. 
For they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours: for which cause give respect to such people.
The churches of Asia send their love to you. So do Aquila and Prisca, with the church which is in their house. 
All the brothers send their love to you. Give one another a holy kiss. 
I, Paul, send you these words of love in my writing. 
If any man has not love for the Lord, let him be cursed. Maran atha (our Lord comes). 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. So be it.Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort;
Who gives us comfort in all our troubles, so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 
For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent, so through Christ does our comfort become greater. 
But if we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo: 
And our hope for you is certain; in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles, so you will take part in the comfort. 
For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia, that the weight of it was very great, more than our power, so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life: 
Yes, we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves, so that our hope might not be in ourselves, but in God who is able to give life to the dead: 
Who gave us salvation from so great a death: on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation; 
You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us; so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons, praise may go up to God for us from all of them. 
For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God. 
For in our letters we say no other things to you, but those which you are reading, and to which you give agreement, and, it is my hope, will go on doing so to the end: 
Even as you have been ready, in part, to say that we are your glory, in the same way that you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
And being certain of this, it was my purpose to come to you before, so that you might have a second grace; 
And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia, and from there to come back again to you, so that you might send me on my way to Judaea. 
If then I had such a purpose, did I seem to be changing suddenly? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow? 
As God is true, our word to you is not Yes and No. 
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we were preaching among you, even I and Silvanus and Timothy, was not Yes and No, but in him is Yes. 
For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us. 
Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God; 
And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory.
But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time. 
Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.But it was my decision for myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.
For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me? 
And I said this very thing in my letter, for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy; being certain of this, that my joy is the joy of you all. 
For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you; not to give you sorrow, but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you. 
But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow, he has been so, not to me only, but in some measure to all of you (I say this that I may not be over-hard on you). 
Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him; 
So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great. 
For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts. 
And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things. 
But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ; 
So that Satan may not get the better of us: for we are not without knowledge of his designs. 
Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and there was an open door for me in the Lord, 
I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there: so I went away from them, and came into Macedonia. 
But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ, and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him.
For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction; 
To the one it is a perfume of death to death; to the other a perfume of life to life. And who is enough for such things? 
For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ.Do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right? or have we need, as some have, of letters of approval to you or from you? 
You yourselves are our letter, whose writing is in our heart, open for every man's reading and knowledge; 
For you are clearly a letter of Christ, the fruit of our work, recorded not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in stone, but in hearts of flesh. 
And this is the certain faith which we have in God through Christ: 
Not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit; but our power comes from God; 
Who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter gives death, but the Spirit gives life. 
For if the operation of the law, giving death, recorded in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the eyes of the children of Israel had to be turned away from the face of Moses because of its glory, a glory which was only for a time: 
Will not the operation of the Spirit have a much greater glory?
For if the operation of the law, producing punishment, had its glory, how much greater will be the operation of the Spirit causing righteousness? 
For the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory, because of the greater glory of that which comes after. 
For if the order which was for a time had its glory, much more will the eternal order have its glory. 
Having then such a hope, we keep nothing back, 
And are not like Moses, who put a veil on his face, so that the children of Israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things: 
But their minds were made hard: for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted; though it is taken away in Christ. 
But to this day, at the reading of the law of Moses, a veil is over their heart.
But when it is turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away.
Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there the heart is free. 
But we all, with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord who is the Spirit.For this reason, because we have been made servants of this new order, through the mercy given to us, we are strong: 
And we have given up the secret things of shame, not walking in false ways, and not making use of the word of God with deceit; but by the revelation of what is true, as before God, we have the approval of every man's sense of right and wrong. 
But if our good news is veiled, it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction: 
Because the god of this world has made blind the minds of those who have not faith, so that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not be shining on them. 
For our preaching is not about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants through Jesus. 
Seeing that it is God who said, Let light be shining out of the dark, who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
But we have this wealth in vessels of earth, so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from God; 
Troubles are round us on every side, but we are not shut in; things are hard for us, but we see a way out of them; 
We are cruelly attacked, but not without hope; we are made low, but we are not without help; 
In our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our bodies. 
For, while living, we are still being given up to death because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our flesh, though it is under the power of death. 
So then, death is working in us, but life in you. 
But having the same spirit of faith, as it is said in the Writings, The words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart; in the same way, our words are the outcome of our faith; 
Because we are certain that he who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead, will do the same for us, and will give us a place in his glory with you. 
For we go through all things on account of you, because the greater the number to whom the grace is given, the greater is the praise to the glory of God. 
For which cause we do not give way to weariness; but though our outer man is getting feebler, our inner man is made new day by day. 
For our present trouble, which is only for a short time, is working out for us a much greater weight of glory; 
While our minds are not on the things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are for a time; but the things which are not seen are eternal.For we are conscious that if this our tent of flesh is taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in heaven. 
For in this we are crying in weariness, greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven: 
So that our spirits may not be unclothed. 
For truly, we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness, for the weight of care which is on us; not because we are desiring to be free from the body, but so that we may have our new body, and death may be overcome by life. 
Now he who has made us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a witness of what is to come. 
So, then, we are ever without fear, and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the Lord, 
(For we are walking by faith, not by seeing,) 
We are without fear, desiring to be free from the body, and to be with the Lord. 
For this reason we make it our purpose, in the body or away from it, to be well-pleasing to him. 
For we all have to come before Christ to be judged; so that every one of us may get his reward for the things done in the body, good or bad. 
Having in mind, then, the fear of the Lord, we put these things before men, but God sees our hearts; and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes. 
We are not again requesting your approval, but we are giving you the chance of taking pride in us, so that you may be able to give an answer to those whose glory is in seeming, and not in the heart. 
For if we are foolish, it is to God; or if we are serious, it is for you. 
For it is the love of Christ which is moving us; because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all, then all have undergone death; 
And that he underwent death for all, so that the living might no longer be living to themselves, but to him who underwent death for them and came back from the dead. 
For this reason, from this time forward we have knowledge of no man after the flesh: even if we have had knowledge of Christ after the flesh, we have no longer any such knowledge. 
So if any man is in Christ, he is in a new world: the old things have come to an end; they have truly become new. 
But all things are of God, who has made us at peace with himself through Christ, and has given to us the work of making peace; 
That is, that God was in Christ making peace between the world and himself, not putting their sins to their account, and having given to us the preaching of this news of peace. 
So we are the representatives of Christ, as if God was making a request to you through us: we make our request to you, in the name of Christ, be at peace with God. 
For him who had no knowledge of sin God made to be sin for us; so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.We then, working together with God, make our request to you not to take the grace of God to no purpose. 
(For he says, I have given ear to you at a good time, and I have been your helper in a day of salvation: see, now is the good time; now is the day of salvation):
Giving no cause for trouble in anything, so that no one may be able to say anything against our work; 
But in everything making it clear that we are the servants of God, in quiet strength, in troubles, in need, in sorrow, 
In blows, in prisons, in attacks, in hard work, in watchings, in going without food; 
In a clean heart, in knowledge, in long waiting, in being kind, in the Holy Spirit, in true love, 
In the true word, in the power of God; with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
By glory and by shame, by an evil name and a good name; as untrue, and still true; 
Unnoted, but still kept fully in mind; as near to death, but still living; as undergoing punishment, but not put to death; 
As full of sorrow, but ever glad; as poor, but giving wealth to others; as having nothing, but still having all things. 
Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians, our heart is wide. 
It is not our feelings to you which are narrow, but yours to us. 
Now to give me back payment of the same sort (I am talking as to my children), let your hearts be wide open to me. 
Do not keep company with those who have not faith: for what is there in common between righteousness and evil, or between light and dark? 
And what agreement is there between Christ and the Evil One? or what part has one who has faith with one who has not? 
And what agreement has the house of God with images? for we are a house of the living God; even as God has said, I will be living among them, and walking with them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
For which cause, Come out from among them, and be separate, says the Lord, and let no unclean thing come near you; and I will take you for myself, 
And will be a Father to you; and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord, the Ruler of all.Because God, then, will give us such rewards, dear brothers, let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit, and become completely holy in the fear of God.
Let your hearts be open to us: we have done no man wrong, no man has been damaged by us, we have made no profit out of any man, 
It is not with the purpose of judging you that I say this: for I have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together. 
My words to you are without fear, I am full of pride on account of you: I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles. 
For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; there were fightings outside and fears inside. 
But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus; 
And not by his coming only, but by the comfort which he had in you, while he gave us word of your desire, your sorrow, your care for me; so that I was still more glad. 
For though my letter gave you pain, I have no regret for it now, though I had before; for I see that the letter gave you pain, but only for a time. 
Now I am glad, not that you had sorrow, but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart; for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything. 
For the sorrow which God gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart, in which there is no reason for grief: but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death. 
For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God, what clearing of yourselves, what wrath against sin, what fear, what desire, what serious purpose, what punishment. In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business. 
So though I sent you a letter, it was not only because of the man who did the wrong, or because of him to whom the wrong was done, but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God. 
So we have been comforted: and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, for his spirit had been made glad by you all. 
For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you; but as we said nothing to you but what was true, so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true. 
And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all, how you gave way to his authority, and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour. 
It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way.And now we give you news, brothers, about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia; 
How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble, and were in the greatest need, they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others. 
For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts, 
Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints:
And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God. 
So that we made a request to Titus that, as he had made a start before, so he might make this grace complete in you. 
And that as you are full of every good thing, of faith, of the word, of knowledge, of a ready mind, and of love to us, so you may be full of this grace in the same way. 
I am not giving you an order, but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love. 
For you see the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how though he had wealth, he became poor on your account, so that through his need you might have wealth. 
And in this I give my opinion: for it is to your profit, who were the first to make a start a year before, not only to do this, but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it. 
Then make the doing of it complete; so that as you had a ready mind, you may give effect to it as you are able. 
For if there is a ready mind, a man will have God's approval in the measure of what he has, and not of what he has not. 
And I am not saying this so that others may get off free, while the weight comes on you: 
But so that things may be equal; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped, and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way, making things equal. 
As it says in the Writings, He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough. 
But praise be to God, who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus. 
For while he gladly gave ear to our request, he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart. 
And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches;
And not only so, but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready: 
And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands: 
For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval, not only of the Lord, but of men. 
And we have sent with them our brother, whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number, but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you. 
If any question comes up about Titus, he is my brother-worker, working with me for you; or about the others, they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ. 
Make clear then to them, as representatives of the churches, the quality of your love, and that the things which we have said about you are true.But there is no need for me to say anything in my letter about the giving to the saints: 
For I have before made clear to those of Macedonia my pride in your ready mind, saying to them that Achaia has been ready for a year back; and a great number have been moved to do the same by your example. 
But I have sent the brothers, so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true, and that, as I said, you may be ready: 
For fear that, if any from Macedonia come with me, and you are not ready, we (not to say, you) might be put to shame in this thing. 
So it seemed to me wise for the brothers to go before, and see that the amount which you had undertaken to give was ready, so that it might be a cause for praise, and not as if we were making profit out of you. 
But in the Writings it says, He who puts in only a small number of seeds, will get in the same; and he who puts them in from a full hand, will have produce in full measure from them. 
Let every man do after the purpose of his heart; not giving with grief, or by force: for God takes pleasure in a ready giver. 
And God is able to give you all grace in full measure; so that ever having enough of all things, you may be full of every good work:
As it is said in the Writings, He has sent out far and wide, he has given to the poor; his righteousness is for ever. 
And he who gives seed for putting into the field and bread for food, will take care of the growth of your seed, at the same time increasing the fruits of your righteousness; 
Your wealth being increased in everything, with a simple mind, causing praise to God through us. 
For this work of giving not only takes care of the needs of the saints, but is the cause of much praise to God; 
For when, through this work of giving, they see what you are, they give glory to God for the way in which you have given yourselves to the good news of Christ, and for the wealth of your giving to them and to all; 
While their hearts go out to you in love and in prayer for you, because of the great grace of God which is in you. 
Praise be to God for what he has given, which words have no power to say.Now I, Paul, myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of Christ, I who am poor in spirit when with you, but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when I am away from you: 
Yes, I make my request to you, so that when I am with you I may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh. 
For though we may be living in the flesh, we are not fighting after the way of the flesh 
(For the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh, but are strong before God for the destruction of high places); 
Putting an end to reasonings, and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of God, and causing every thought to come under the authority of Christ; 
Being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority, after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control. 
Give attention to the things which are before you. If any man seems to himself to be Christ's, let him keep in mind that we are as much Christ's as he is. 
For though I might take pride in our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for your destruction), it will not be a cause of shame to me: 
That I may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters. 
For his letters, they say, have weight and are strong; but in body he is feeble, and his way of talking has little force. 
Let those who say this keep in mind that, what we are in word by letters when we are away, so will we be in act when we are present. 
For we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves: but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and making comparison of themselves with themselves, are not wise. 
We will not give glory to ourselves in over- great measure, but after the measure of the rule which God has given us, a measure which comes even to you. 
For we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are, as if our authority did not come as far as to you: for we came even as far as you with the good news of Christ: 
Not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business, that is, for the work of others; but having hope that, with the growth of your faith, we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work, 
So that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are, and not take credit for another man's work in making things ready to our hand. 
But whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord. 
For the Lord's approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself, but on the Lord's opinion of him.Put up with me if I am a little foolish: but, truly, you do put up with me.
For I have a very great care for you: because you have been married by me to one husband, and it is my desire to give you completely holy to Christ. 
But I have a fear, that in some way, as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake, your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ. 
For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are, or if you have got a different spirit, or a different sort of good news from those which came to you, how well you put up with these things. 
For in my opinion, I am in no way less than the most important of the Apostles. 
But though I am rough in my way of talking, I am not so in knowledge, as we have made clear to all by our acts among you. 
Or did I do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up, because I gave you the good news of God without reward? 
I took money from other churches as payment for my work, so that I might be your servant; 
And when I was present with you, and was in need, I let no man be responsible for me; for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, gave me whatever was needed; and in everything I kept myself from being a trouble to you, and I will go on doing so. 
As the true word of Christ is in me, I will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of Achaia. 
Why? because I have no love for you? let God be judge. 
But what I do, that I will go on doing, so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one; so that, in the cause of their pride, they may be seen to be the same as we are. 
For such men are false Apostles, workers of deceit, making themselves seem like Apostles of Christ. 
And it is no wonder; for even Satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light. 
So it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness; whose end will be the reward of their works. 
I say again, Let me not seem foolish to anyone; but if I do, put up with me as such, so that I may take a little glory to myself.
What I am now saying is not by the order of the Lord, but as a foolish person, taking credit to myself, as it seems. 
Seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh, I will do the same. 
For you put up with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves. 
You put up with a man if he makes servants of you, if he makes profit out of you, if he makes you prisoners, if he puts himself in a high place, if he gives you blows on the face. 
I say this by way of shaming ourselves, as if we had been feeble. But if anyone puts himself forward (I am talking like a foolish person), I will do the same. 
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they of Israel? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. 
Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking foolishly) I am more so; I have had more experience of hard work, of prisons, of blows more than measure, of death. 
Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one. 
Three times I was whipped with rods, once I was stoned, three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea, a night and a day I have been in the water; 
In frequent travels, in dangers on rivers, in dangers from outlaws, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the town, in dangers in the waste land, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers; 
In hard work and weariness, in frequent watchings, going without food and drink, cold and in need of clothing. 
In addition to all the other things, there is that which comes on me every day, the care of all the churches. 
Who is feeble and I am not feeble? who is in danger of falling, and I am not angry? 
If I have to take credit to myself, I will do so in the things in which I am feeble. 
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be praise for ever, is witness that the things which I say are true. 
In Damascus, the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus, in order to take me: 
And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window, I got free from his hands.As it is necessary for me to take glory to myself, though it is not a good thing, I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
I have knowledge of a man in Christ, fourteen years back (if he was in the body, or out of the body, I am not able to say, but God only), who was taken up to the third heaven. 
And I have knowledge of such a man (if he was in the body, or out of the body, I am not able to say, but God only), 
How he was taken up into Paradise, and words came to his ears which may not be said, and which man is not able to say. 
On account of such a one I will have glory: for myself I will take no glory, but only in my feeble body. 
For if I had a desire to take credit to myself, it would not be foolish, for I would be saying what is true: but I will not, for fear that I might seem to any man more than he sees me to be, or has word from me that I am.
And because the revelations were so very great, in order that I might not be overmuch lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, one sent from Satan to give me pain. 
And about this thing I made request to the Lord three times that it might be taken away from me. 
And he said to me, My grace is enough for you, for my power is made complete in what is feeble. Most gladly, then, will I take pride in my feeble body, so that the power of Christ may be on me. 
So I take pleasure in being feeble, in unkind words, in needs, in cruel attacks, in troubles, on account of Christ: for when I am feeble, then am I strong. 
I have been forced by you to become foolish, though it was right for my praise to have come from you: for in no way was I less than the chief of the Apostles, though I am nothing. 
Truly the signs of an Apostle were done among you in quiet strength, with wonders and acts of power. 
For what is there in which you were made less than the other churches, but in the one thing that I was not a trouble to you? Let me have forgiveness for this wrong. 
This is now the third time that I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a trouble to you: my desire is for you, not for your property: for it is not the children's business to make store for their fathers, but the fathers for the children. 
And I will gladly give all I have for your souls. If I have the more love for you, am I to be loved the less? 
But let it be so, that I was not a trouble to you myself; but (someone may say) being false, I took you with deceit. 
Did I make a profit out of you by any of those whom I sent to you? 
I gave orders to Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus make any profit out of you? were we not guided by the same Spirit, in the same ways? 
It may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right; but we are saying these things before God in Christ. For all things, dear brothers, are for your profit. 
For I have a fear that, when I come, you may not be answering to my desire, and that I may not be answering to yours; that there may be fighting, hate, angry feeling, divisions, evil talk about others, secrets, thoughts of pride, outbursts against authority; 
And that when I come again, my God may put me to shame among you, and I may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways, and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way.This is the third time that I am coming to you. From the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain. 
I said before, and still say it before I come, as being present for the second time, though I am still away from you, to those who have done wrong before, and to all the others, that if I come again I will not have pity; 
Seeing that you are looking for a sign of Christ giving out his word in me; who is not feeble in relation to you, but is strong in you: 
For he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross, but he is living by the power of God. And we are feeble in him, but we will be living with him through the power of God in relation to you. 
Make a test of yourselves, if you are in the faith; make certain of yourselves. Or are you not conscious in yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, if you are truly Christ's? 
But it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly Christ's. 
Now our prayer to God is that you may do no evil; not in order that it may be put to our credit, but so that you may do what is right, whatever we may seem. 
Because we are able to do nothing against what is true, but only for it.
For we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong: and this is our prayer, even that you may be made complete. 
For this cause I am writing these things while I am away, so that there may be need for me, when I am present, to make use of sharp measures, by the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for destruction. 
Let this be my last word, brothers; be glad; be complete; be comforted; be of the same mind; be at peace with one another: and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
Give one another a holy kiss. 
All the saints send their love to you. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the harmony of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead), 
And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: 
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who gave himself for our sins, so that he might make us free from this present evil world, after the purpose of our God and Father: 
To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it. 
I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort;
Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ. 
But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him. 
As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him. 
Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. 
Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's. 
For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. 
For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it: 
And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers. 
But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace, 
To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood, 
And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus. 
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days. 
But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother. 
Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true. 
Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia. 
And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person:
Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him; 
And they gave glory to God in me.Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me. 
And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect.
But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision:
And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us; 
To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you. 
But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man's person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me; 
But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision 
(Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles);
When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision; 
Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do.
But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. 
For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision. 
And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways. 
But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews? 
We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 
Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness. 
But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way! 
For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer. 
For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God. 
I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me. 
I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing.O foolish Galatians, by what strange powers have you been tricked, to whom it was made clear that Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross? 
Give me an answer to this one question, Did the Spirit come to you through the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Are you so foolish? having made a start in the Spirit, will you now be made complete in the flesh? 
Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose? if it is in fact to no purpose. 
He who gives you the Spirit, and does works of power among you, is it by the works of law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Even as Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness. 
Be certain, then, that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. 
And the holy Writings, seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith, gave the good news before to Abraham, saying, In you will all the nations have a blessing. 
So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith. 
For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse: because it is said in the Writings, A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law. 
Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God, is clear; because, The upright will be living by faith. 
And the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will have life by them. 
Christ has made us free from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: because it is said in the Writings, A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree: 
So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give. 
Brothers, as men would say, even a man's agreement, when it has been made certain, may not be put on one side, or have additions made to it. 
Now to Abraham were the undertakings given, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as of a great number; but as of one, he says, And to your seed, which is Christ. 
Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect. 
Because if the heritage is by the law, it is no longer dependent on the word of God; but God gave it to Abraham by his word. 
What then is the law? It was an addition made because of sin, till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between. 
Now a go-between is not a go- between of one; but God is one. 
Is the law then against the words of God? in no way; because if there had been a law which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. 
However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith. 
But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come. 
So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith. 
But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant. 
Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 
For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ. 
There is no Jew or Greek, servant or free, male or female: because you are all one in Jesus Christ. 
And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and yours is the heritage by the right of God's undertaking given to Abraham.But I say that as long as the son is a child, he is in no way different from a servant, though he is lord of all; 
But is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father. 
So we, when we were young, were kept under the first rules of the world; 
But when the time had come, God sent out his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
That he might make them free who were under the law, and that we might be given the place of sons. 
And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, saying, Abba, Father. 
So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours. 
But at that time, having no knowledge of God, you were servants to those who by right are no gods: 
But now that you have come to have knowledge of God, or more truly, God has knowledge of you, how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things, desiring to be servants to them again?
You keep days, and months, and fixed times, and years.
I am in fear of you, that I may have been working for you to no purpose. 
My desire for you, brothers, is that you may be as I am, because I am as you are. You have done me no wrong; 
But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time; 
And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh, or put shame on it; but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 
Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me. 
So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words? 
Their interest in you is not good; but their desire is that you may be shut out, so that you may go after them. 
But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you. 
My children, of whom I am again in birth-pains till Christ is formed in you,
Truly my desire is to be present with you now, using a changed voice; for I am troubled about you. 
Say, you whose desire it is to be under the law, do you not give ear to the law? 
Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant- woman, and one by the free woman. 
Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God. 
Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar. 
Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children. 
But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother. 
For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband. 
Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God. 
But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit, even so it is now. 
What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman. 
So, brothers, we are not children of the servant-woman, but of the free woman.Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again. 
See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you. 
Yes, I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision, that he will have to keep all the law. 
You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace. 
For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love. 
You were going on well; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true? 
This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his. 
A little leaven makes a change in all the mass. 
I am certain about you in the Lord, that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment, whoever he is.
But I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still attacked? then has the shame of the cross been taken away. 
My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves. 
Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another. 
For all the law is made complete in one word, even in this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. 
But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another. 
But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh.
For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; because these are opposite the one to the other; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do. 
But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 
Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses, 
Worship of images, use of strange powers, hates, fighting, desire for what another has, angry feelings, attempts to get the better of others, divisions, false teachings, 
Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God. 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kind acts, well-doing, faith, 
Gentle behaviour, control over desires: against such there is no law. 
And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires. 
If we are living by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us be guided. 
Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another.Brothers, if a man is taken in any wrongdoing, you who are of the Spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love; keeping watch on yourself, for fear that you yourself may be tested. 
Take on yourselves one another's troubles, and so keep the law of Christ. 
For if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing, he is tricked by himself.
But let every man make test of his work, and then will his cause for glory be in himself only, and not in his neighbour. 
Because every man is responsible for his part of the work. 
But let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher. 
Be not tricked; God is not made sport of: for whatever seed a man puts in, that will he get back as grain. 
Because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death; but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will of the Spirit get the reward of eternal life. 
And let us not get tired of well-doing; for at the right time we will get in the grain, if we do not give way to weariness. 
So then, as we have the chance, let us do good to all men, and specially to those who are of the family of the faith. 
See the size of the handwriting which I myself have made use of in writing to you. 
Those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh, put force on you to undergo circumcision; only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of Christ.
Because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law; but they would have you undergo circumcision, so that they may have glory in your flesh.
But far be it from me to have glory in anything, but only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me, and I for it.
For having circumcision is nothing, and not having circumcision is nothing, but only a new order of existence. 
And on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy, and on the Israel of God. 
From this time on let no man be a trouble to me; because my body is marked with the marks of Jesus. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. So be it.Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the purpose of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and those who have faith in Christ Jesus: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us every blessing of the Spirit in the heavens in Christ: 
Even as he made selection of us in him from the first, so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love: 
As we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself, through Jesus Christ, in the good pleasure of his purpose, 
To the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely gave to us in the Loved One: 
In whom we have salvation through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, through the wealth of his grace,
Which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care;
Having made clear to us the secret of his purpose, in agreement with the design which he had in mind, to put into his hands 
The ordering of the times when they are complete, so that all things might come to a head in Christ, the things in heaven and the things on the earth; in him, I say,
In whom we have a heritage, being marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with his designs; 
So that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in Christ: 
In whom you, having been given the true word, the good news of your salvation, and through your faith in him, were given the sign of the Holy Spirit of hope, 
Which is the first-fruit of our heritage, till God gets back that which is his, to the praise of his glory. 
For this cause I, having had news of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and which you make clear to all the saints, 
Give praise without end for you, keeping you in mind in my prayers; 
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; 
And that having the eyes of your heart full of light, you may have knowledge of what is the hope of his purpose, what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints, 
And how unlimited is his power to us who have faith, as is seen in the working of the strength of his power, 
By which he made Christ come back from the dead, and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven, 
Far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named, not only in the present order, but in that which is to come: 
And he has put all things under his feet, and has made him to be head over all things to the church, 
Which is his body, the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete.And to you did he give life, when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins,
In which you were living in the past, after the ways of this present world, doing the pleasure of the lord of the power of the air, the spirit who is now working in those who go against the purpose of God; 
Among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh, giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and the punishment of God was waiting for us even as for the rest. 
But God, being full of mercy, through the great love which he had for us, 
Even when we were dead through our sins, gave us life together with Christ (by grace you have salvation), 
So that we came back from death with him, and are seated with him in the heavens, in Christ Jesus; 
That in the time to come he might make clear the full wealth of his grace in his mercy to us in Christ Jesus: 
Because by grace you have salvation through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is given by God: 
Not by works, so that no man may take glory to himself.
For by his act we were given existence in Christ Jesus to do those good works which God before made ready for us so that we might do them. 
For this reason keep it in mind that in the past you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are looked on as being outside the circumcision by those who have circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; 
That you were at that time without Christ, being cut off from any part in Israel's rights as a nation, having no part in God's agreement, having no hope, and without God in the world. 
But now in Christ Jesus you who at one time were far off are made near in the blood of Christ. 
For he is our peace, who has made the two into one, and by whom the middle wall of division has been broken down, 
Having in his flesh put an end to that which made the division between us, even the law with its rules and orders, so that he might make in himself, of the two, one new man, so making peace; 
And that the two might come into agreement with God in one body through the cross, so putting an end to that division. 
And he came preaching peace to you who were far off, and to those who were near; 
Because through him the two of us are able to come near in one Spirit to the Father. 
So then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of God, but you are numbered among the saints, and of the family of God,
Resting on the base of the Apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief keystone, 
In whom all the building, rightly joined together, comes to be a holy house of God in the Lord; 
In whom you, with the rest, are united together as a living-place of God in the Spirit.For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles,
If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge, which was given to me for you, 
How by revelation the secret was made clear to me, as I said before in a short letter, 
By the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of Christ; 
Which in other generations was not given to the sons of men, but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 
Which is that the Gentiles have a part in the heritage, and in the same body, and in the same hope in Christ through the good news, 
Of which I was made a preacher, through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power. 
To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, was this grace given, so that I might make clear to the Gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of Christ: 
And make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in God who made all things; 
So that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide-shining wisdom of God, 
Which is seen in his eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him. 
For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you, which are your glory. 
For this cause I go down on my knees before the Father, 
From whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
That in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his Spirit in your hearts; 
So that Christ may have his place in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and based in love, 
May have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is, 
And to have knowledge of the love of Christ which is outside all knowledge, so that you may be made complete as God himself is complete. 
Now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts, through the power which is working in us, 
To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever. So be it.I then, the prisoner in the Lord, make this request from my heart, that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which God's purpose has given you, 
With all gentle and quiet behaviour, taking whatever comes, putting up with one another in love; 
Taking care to keep the harmony of the Spirit in the yoke of peace. 
There is one body and one Spirit, even as you have been marked out by God in the one hope of his purpose for you; 
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. 
But to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of Christ. 
For this reason he says, He went up on high, taking his prisoners with him, and gave freely to men. 
(Now this, He went up, what is it but that he first went down into the lower parts of the earth? 
He who went down is the same who went up far over all the heavens so that he might make all things complete.) 
And he gave some as Apostles, and some, prophets; and some, preachers of the good news; and some to give care and teaching; 
For the training of the saints as servants in the church, for the building up of the body of Christ: 
Till we all come to the harmony of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to full growth, to the full measure of Christ: 
So that we may be no longer children, sent this way and that, turned about by every wind of teaching, by the twisting and tricks of men, by the deceits of error; 
But saying true words in love, may come to full growth in him, who is the head, even Christ; 
Through whom all the body, being rightly formed and united together, by the full working of every part, is increased to the building up of itself in love. 
This I say, then, and give witness in the Lord, that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit, 
Whose thoughts are dark, to whom the life of God is strange because they are without knowledge, and their hearts have been made hard; 
Who having no more power of feeling, have given themselves up to evil passions, to do all unclean things with overmuch desire. 
For this was not the teaching of Christ which was given to you; 
If in fact you gave ear to him, and were given teaching in him, even as what is true is made clear in Jesus: 
That you are to put away, in relation to your earlier way of life, the old man, which has become evil by love of deceit; 
And be made new in the spirit of your mind, 
And put on the new man, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way of living. 
And so, putting away false words, let everyone say what is true to his neighbour: for we are parts one of another. 
Be angry without doing wrong; let not the sun go down on your wrath; 
And do not give way to the Evil One. 
Let him who was a thief be so no longer, but let him do good work with his hands, so that he may have something to give to him who is in need. 
Let no evil talk come out of your mouth, but only what is good for giving necessary teaching, and for grace to those who give ear. 
And do not give grief to the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were marked for the day of salvation. 
Let all bitter, sharp and angry feeling, and noise, and evil words, be put away from you, with all unkind acts; 
And be kind to one another, full of pity, having forgiveness for one another, even as God in Christ had forgiveness for you.Let it then be your desire to be like God, as well-loved children;
And be living in love, even as Christ had love for you, and gave himself up for us, an offering to God for a perfume of a sweet smell. 
But evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things, or desire for others' property, let it not even be named among you, as is right for saints; 
And let there be no low behaviour, or foolish talk, or words said in sport, which are not right, but in place of them the giving of praise. 
Being certain of this, that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh, no unclean person, or one who has desire for the property of others, or who gives worship to images, has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and God. 
Do not be turned from the right way by foolish words; for because of these things the punishment of God comes on those who do not put themselves under him. 
Have no part with such men; 
For you at one time were dark, but now are light in the Lord: let your behaviour be that of children of light 
(Because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true), 
Testing by experience what is well-pleasing to the Lord; 
And have no company with the works of the dark, which give no fruit, but make their true quality clear; 
For the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words. 
But all things, when their true quality is seen, are made clear by the light: because everything which is made clear is light. 
For this reason he says, Be awake, you who are sleeping, and come up from among the dead, and Christ will be your light. 
Take care then how you are living, not as unwise, but as wise; 
Making good use of the time, because the days are evil. 
For this reason, then, do not be foolish, but be conscious of the Lord's pleasure. 
And do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome, but be full of the Spirit; 
Joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the Spirit, using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 
Giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father; 
Letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of Christ. 
Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as of the Lord. 
For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body. 
And as the church is under Christ's authority, so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things. 
Husbands, have love for your wives, even as Christ had love for the church, and gave himself for it; 
So that he might make it holy, having made it clean with the washing of water by the word, 
And might take it for himself, a church full of glory, not having one mark or fold or any such thing; but that it might be holy and complete. 
Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies. He who has love for his wife has love for himself: 
For no man ever had hate for his flesh; but he gives it food and takes care of it, even as Christ does for the church; 
Because we are parts of his body. 
For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. 
This is a great secret: but my words are about Christ and the church. 
But do you, everyone, have love for his wife, even as for himself; and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband.Children, do what is ordered by your fathers and mothers in the Lord: for this is right. 
Give honour to your father and mother (which is the first rule having a reward),
So that all may be well for you, and your life may be long on the earth.
And, you fathers, do not make your children angry: but give them training in the teaching and fear of the Lord. 
Servants, do what is ordered by those who are your natural masters, having respect and fear for them, with all your heart, as to Christ; 
Not only under your master's eye, as pleasers of men; but as servants of Christ, doing the pleasure of God from the heart; 
Doing your work readily, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
In the knowledge that for every good thing anyone does, he will have his reward from the Lord, If he is a servant or if he is free. 
And, you masters, do the same things to them, not making use of violent words: in the knowledge that their Master and yours is in heaven, and he has no respect for a man's position. 
Lastly, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his power. 
Take up God's instruments of war, so that you may be able to keep your position against all the deceits of the Evil One. 
For our fight is not against flesh and blood, but against authorities and powers, against the world-rulers of this dark night, against the spirits of evil in the heavens. 
For this reason take up all the arms of God, so that you may be able to be strong in the evil day, and, having done all, to keep your place.
Take your place, then, having your body clothed with the true word, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness; 
Be ready with the good news of peace as shoes on your feet; 
And most of all, using faith as a cover to keep off all the flaming arrows of the Evil One. 
And take salvation for your head-dress and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
With prayers and deep desires, making requests at all times in the Spirit, and keeping watch, with strong purpose, in prayer for all the saints, 
And for me, that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make clear without fear the secret of the good news, 
For which I am a representative in chains, and that I may say without fear the things which it is right for me to say. 
But so that you may have knowledge of my business, and how I am, Tychicus, the well-loved brother and tested servant in the Lord, will give you news of all things: 
Whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, so that you may have knowledge of our position, and that he may give comfort to your hearts. 
Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Grace be with all those who have true love for our Lord Jesus Christ.Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the Bishops and Deacons of the church: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I give praise to my God at every memory of you,
And in all my prayers for you all, making my request with joy,
Because of your help in giving the good news from the first day till now; 
For I am certain of this very thing, that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of Jesus Christ: 
So it is right for me to take thought for you all in this way, because I have you in my heart; for in my chains, and in my arguments before the judges in support of the good news, making clear that it is true, you all have your part with me in grace.
For God is my witness, how my love goes out to you all in the loving mercies of Christ Jesus. 
And my prayer is that you may be increased more and more in knowledge and experience; 
So that you may give your approval to the best things; that you may be true and without wrongdoing till the day of Christ; 
Being full of the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 
Now it is my purpose to make clear to you, brothers, that the cause of the good news has been helped by my experiences; 
So that it became clear through all the Praetorium, and to all the rest, that I was a prisoner on account of Christ; 
And most of the brothers in the Lord, taking heart because of my chains, are all the stronger to give the word of God without fear.
Though some are preaching Christ out of envy and competition, others do it out of a good heart: 
These do it from love, conscious that I am responsible for the cause of the good news: 
But those are preaching Christ in a spirit of competition, not from their hearts, but with the purpose of giving me pain in my prison. 
What then? only that in every way, falsely or truly, the preaching of Christ goes on; and in this I am glad, and will be glad. 
For I am conscious that this will be for my salvation, through your prayer and the giving out of the stored wealth of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
In the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will I be put to shame, but that without fear, as at all times, so now will Christ have glory in my body, by life or by death. 
For to me life is Christ and death is profit. 
But if I go on living in the flesh — if this is the fruit of my work — then I do not see what decision to make. 
I am in a hard position between the two, having a desire to go away and be with Christ, which is very much better: 
Still, to go on in the flesh is more necessary because of you. 
And being certain of this, I am conscious that I will go on, yes, and go on with you all, for your growth and joy in the faith; 
So that your pride in me may be increased in Christ Jesus through my being present with you again. 
Only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of Christ, so that if I come and see you or if I am away from you, I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit, working together with one soul for the faith of the good news;
Having no fear of those who are against you; which is a clear sign of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God; 
Because to you it has been given in the cause of Christ not only to have faith in him, but to undergo pain on his account: 
Fighting the same fight which you saw in me, and now have word of in me.If then there is any comfort in Christ, any help given by love, any uniting of hearts in the Spirit, any loving mercies and pity, 
Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in harmony and of one mind; 
Doing nothing through envy or through pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself; 
Not looking everyone to his private good, but keeping in mind the things of others. 
Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus, 
To whom, though himself in the form of God, it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God; 
But he made himself as nothing, taking the form of a servant, being made like men; 
And being seen in form as a man, he took the lowest place, and let himself be put to death, even the death of the cross. 
For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name; 
So that at the name of Jesus every knee may be bent, of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld, 
And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
So then, my loved ones, as you have at all times done what I say, not only when I am present, but now much more when I am not with you, give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts; 
For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure. 
Do all things without protests and arguments; 
So that you may be holy and gentle, children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,
Offering the word of life; so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ, because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect. 
And even if I am offered like a drink offering, giving myself for the cause and work of your faith, I am glad and have joy with you all: 
And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy. 
But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be comforted when I have news of you. 
For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you. 
For they all go after what is theirs, not after the things of Christ. 
But his quality is clear to you; how, as a child is to its father, so he was a help to me in the work of the good news. 
Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me: 
But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long. 
But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight, and your servant, sent by you for help in my need; 
Because his heart was with you all, and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill: 
For in fact he was ill almost to death: but God had mercy on him; and not only on him but on me, so that I might not have grief on grief. 
I have sent him, then, the more gladly, so that when you see him again, you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow. 
So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy, and give honour to such as he is: 
Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete.For the rest, my brothers, be glad in the Lord. Writing the same things to you is no trouble to me, and for you it is safe.
Be on the watch against dogs, against the workers of evil, against those of the circumcision: 
For we are the circumcision, who give worship to God and have glory in Jesus Christ, and have no faith in the flesh: 
Even though I myself might have faith in the flesh: if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh, I have more: 
Being given circumcision on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in relation to the law, a Pharisee:
In bitter hate I was cruel to the church; I kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail. 
But those things which were profit to me, I gave up for Christ. 
Yes truly, and I am ready to give up all things for the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, which is more than all: for whom I have undergone the loss of all things, and to me they are less than nothing, so that I may have Christ as my reward, 
And be seen in him, not having my righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
That I may have knowledge of him, and of the power of his coming back from the dead, and a part with him in his pains, becoming like him in his death; 
If in any way I may have the reward of life from the dead. 
Not as if I had even now got the reward or been made complete: but I go on in the hope that I may come to the knowledge of that for which I was made the servant of Christ Jesus.
Brothers, it is clear to me that I have not come to that knowledge; but one thing I do, letting go those things which are past, and stretching out to the things which are before,
I go forward to the mark, even the reward of the high purpose of God in Christ Jesus.
Then let us all, who have come to full growth, be of this mind: and if in anything you are of a different mind, even this will God make clear to you: 
Only, as far as we have got, let us be guided by the same rule. 
Brothers, take me as your example, and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given. 
For there are those, of whom I have given you word before, and do so now with sorrow, who are haters of the cross of Christ; 
Whose end is destruction, whose god is the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth. 
For our country is in heaven; from where the Saviour for whom we are waiting will come, even the Lord Jesus Christ: 
By whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory, in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself.So my brothers, well loved and very dear to me, my joy and crown, be strong in the Lord, my loved ones. 
I make request to Euodias and Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. 
And I make request to you, true helper in my work, to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news, with Clement and the rest of my brother-workers whose names are in the book of life. 
Be glad in the Lord at all times: again I say, Be glad. 
Let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men. The Lord is near. 
Have no cares; but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God. 
And the peace of God, which is deeper than all knowledge, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 
For the rest, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things have honour, whatever things are upright, whatever things are holy, whatever things are beautiful, whatever things are of value, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, give thought to these things. 
The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching, and which you saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you. 
But I am very glad in the Lord that your care for me has come to life again; though you did in fact take thought for me, but you were not able to give effect to it. 
But I will not say anything about my needs, for I am able, wherever I am, to be dependent on myself. 
It is the same to me if I am looked down on or honoured; everywhere and in all things I have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food; how to have wealth and how to be in need. 
I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength. 
But you did well to have care for me in my need. 
And you have knowledge, Philippians, that when the good news first came to you, when I went away from Macedonia, no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints, but you only; 
Because even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need. 
Not that I am looking for an offering, but for fruit which may be put to your credit. 
I have all things and more than enough: I am made full, having had from Epaphroditus the things which came from you, a perfume of a sweet smell, an offering well pleasing to God. 
And my God will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in Christ Jesus. 
Now to God our Father be glory for ever and ever. So be it.
Give words of love to every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their love. 
All the saints send their love to you, specially those who are of Caesar's house. 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the purpose of God, and Timothy our brother,
To the saints and true brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father. 
We give praise to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, making prayer for you at all times, 
After hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have for all the saints, 
Through the hope which is in store for you in heaven; knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news, 
Which has come to you; and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase, as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of God; 
As it was given to you by Epaphras, our well-loved helper, who is a true servant of Christ for us, 
And who, himself, made clear to us your love in the Spirit. 
For this reason, we, from the day when we had word of it, keep on in prayer for you, that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose, with all wisdom and experience of the Spirit, 
Living uprightly in the approval of the Lord, giving fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
Full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory, so that you may undergo all troubles with joy; 
Giving praise to the Father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light; 
Who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the Son of his love; 
In whom we have our salvation, the forgiveness of sins: 
Who is the image of the unseen God coming into existence before all living things; 
For by him all things were made, in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen, authorities, lords, rulers, and powers; all things were made by him and for him; 
He is before all things, and in him all things have being.
And he is the head of the body, the church: the starting point of all things, the first to come again from the dead; so that in all things he might have the chief place. 
For God in full measure was pleased to be in him; 
Through him uniting all things with himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, I say, uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven. 
And you, who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works, he has now made one 
In the body of his flesh through death, so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him: 
If you keep yourselves safely based in the faith, not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you, and which was given to every living being under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant. 
Now I have joy in my pain because of you, and in my flesh I undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of Christ complete, for the salvation of his body, the church; 
Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you, to give effect to the word of God, 
The secret which has been kept from all times and generations, but has now been made clear to his saints, 
To whom God was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: 
Whom we are preaching; guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that every man may be complete in Christ; 
And for this purpose I am working, using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly.For it is my desire to give you news of the great fight I am making for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh; 
So that their hearts may be comforted, and that being joined together in love, they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of God, even Christ, 
In whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge. 
I say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words. 
For though I am not present in the flesh, still I am with you in the spirit, seeing with joy your order, and your unchanging faith in Christ. 
As, then, you took Christ Jesus the Lord, so go on in him, 
Rooted and based together in him, strong in the faith which the teaching gave you, giving praise to God at all times. 
Take care that no one takes you away by force, through man's wisdom and deceit, going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world, and not after Christ: 
For in him all the wealth of God's being has a living form, 
And you are complete in him, who is the head of all rule and authority: 
In whom you had a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; 
Having been put to death with him in baptism, by which you came to life again with him, through faith in the working of God, who made him come back from the dead. 
And you, being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh, to you, I say, he gave life together with him, and forgiveness of all our sins; 
Having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us, taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross; 
Having made himself free from the rule of authorities and powers, he put them openly to shame, glorying over them in it. 
For this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or Sabbaths: 
For these are an image of the things which are to come; but the body is Christ's. 
Let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels; having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen, being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind, 
And not joined to the Head, from whom all the body, being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands, has its growth with the increase of God. 
If you were made free, by your death with Christ, from the rules of the world, why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders 
Which say there may be no touching, tasting, or taking in your hands, 
(Rules which are all to come to an end with their use) after the orders and teaching of men? 
These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self-ordered worship and making little of oneself, and being cruel to the body, not honouring it by giving it its natural use.If then you have a new life with Christ, give your attention to the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 
Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth. 
For your life on earth is done, and you have a secret life with Christ in God. 
At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory. 
Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods;
Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders;
Among whom you were living in the past, when you did such things. 
But now it is right for you to put away all these things; wrath, passion, bad feeling, curses, unclean talk; 
Do not make false statements to one another; because you have put away the old man with all his doings, 
And have put on the new man, which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker; 
Where there is no Greek or Jew, no one with circumcision or without circumcision, no division between nations, no servant or free man: but Christ is all and in all. 
As saints of God, then, holy and dearly loved, let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy, kind feeling, a low opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, and a power of undergoing all things; 
Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another, if anyone has done wrong to his brother, even as the Lord had forgiveness for you: 
And more than all, have love; the only way in which you may be completely joined together. 
And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts, as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body; and give praise to God at all times. 
Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom; teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words, making melody to God with grace in your hearts. 
And whatever you do, in word or in act, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving praise to God the Father through him. 
Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as is right in the Lord. 
Husbands, have love for your wives, and be not bitter against them. 
Children, do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord. 
Fathers, do not be hard on your children, so that their spirit may not be broken. 
Servants, in all things do the orders of your natural masters; not only when their eyes are on you, as pleasers of men, but with all your heart, fearing the Lord:
Whatever you do, do it readily, as to the Lord and not to men;
Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage: for you are the servants of the Lord Christ.
For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done, without respect for any man's position.Masters, give your servants what is right and equal, conscious that you have a Master in heaven. 
Give yourselves to prayer at all times, keeping watch with praise; 
And making prayer for us, that God may give us an open door for the preaching of the word, the secret of Christ, for which I am now in chains; 
So that I may make it clear, as it is right for me to do. 
Be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside, making good use of the time. 
Let your talk be with grace, mixed with salt, so that you may be able to give an answer to everyone. 
Tychicus will give you news of all my business: he is a dear brother and true servant and helper in the word; 
And I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may have news of how we are, and so that he may give your hearts comfort; 
And with him I have sent Onesimus, the true and well-loved brother, who is one of you. They will give you word of everything which is taking place here. 
Aristarchus, my brother-prisoner, sends his love to you, and Mark, a relation of Barnabas (about whom you have been given orders: if he comes to you, be kind to him),
And Jesus, whose other name is Justus; these are of the circumcision: they are my only brother-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me. 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his love, ever taking thought for you in his prayers, that you may be complete and fully certain of all the purpose of God.
For I give witness of him that he has undergone much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis. 
Luke, our well-loved medical friend, and Demas, send you their love. 
Give my love to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nymphas and the church in their house. 
And when this letter has been made public among you, let the same be done in the church of Laodicea; and see that you have the letter from Laodicea. 
Say to Archippus, See that you do the work which the Lord has given you to do. 
I, Paul, give you this word of love in my handwriting. Keep in memory that I am a prisoner. Grace be with you.Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. 
We give praise to God at all times for you, keeping you in memory in our prayers; 
Having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; 
Being conscious, my brothers, dear to God, that you have been marked out by God's purpose; 
Because our good news came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit, so that you were completely certain of it; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you. 
And you took us and the Lord as your example, after the word had come to you in much trouble, with joy in the Holy Spirit;
So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia. 
For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God is made clear; so that we have no need to say anything. 
For they themselves give the news of how we came among you; and how you were turned from images to God, to the worship of a true and living God, 
Waiting for his Son from heaven, who came back from the dead, even Jesus, our Saviour from the wrath to come.For you yourselves, brothers, are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect: 
But after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw, at Philippi, by the help of God we gave you the good news without fear, though everything was against us. 
For our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit: 
But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God, so we give it out; not as pleasing men, but God by whom our hearts are tested. 
For it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth- sounding false words, and God is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves, 
Or looking for glory from men, from you or from others, when we might have made ourselves a care to you as Apostles of Christ. 
But we were gentle among you, like a woman caring for her little ones: 
Even so, being full of loving desire for you, we took delight in giving you not only God's good news, but even our lives, because you were dear to us. 
For you have the memory, my brothers, of our trouble and care; how, working night and day, so that we might not be a trouble to any of you, we gave you the good news of God. 
You are witnesses, with God, how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith; 
Even as you saw how, like a father with his children, we were teaching and comforting you all, and giving witness,
So that your lives might be pleasing to God, who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory. 
And for this cause we still give praise to God, that, when the word came to your ears through us, you took it, not as the word of man, but, as it truly is, the word of God, which has living power in you who have faith. 
For you, my brothers, took as your examples the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; because you underwent the same things from your countrymen as they did from the Jews; 
Who put to death the Lord Jesus and the prophets, violently driving us out; who are unpleasing to God and against all men; 
Who, to make the measure of their sins complete, kept us from giving the word of salvation to the Gentiles: but the wrath of God is about to come on them in the fullest degree. 
But we, my brothers, being away from you for a short time, in body but not in heart, had all the more desire to see your face; 
For which reason we made attempts to come to you, even I, Paul, once and again; but Satan kept us from coming. 
For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus, at his coming? 
For you are our glory and our joy.At last our desire to have news of you was so strong that, while we ourselves were waiting at Athens, 
We sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ, to give you strength and comfort in your faith; 
So that no man might be moved by these troubles; because you see that these things are part of God's purpose for us.
And when we were with you, we said to you that trouble was before us; and so it came about, as you see. 
For this reason, when I was no longer able to keep quiet, I sent to get news of your faith, fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing. 
But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has given us good news of your faith and love, and that you have happy memories of us, desiring greatly to see us, even as we do to see you; 
For this cause, brothers, in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith; 
For it is life to us if you keep your faith in the Lord unchanged. 
For how great is the praise which we give to God for you, and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our God;
Night and day requesting God again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete. 
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you; 
And the Lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men, even as our love to you; 
So that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.And last of all, the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the Lord Jesus, is this: that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to God, as in fact you are doing now, so you will go on in these ways, but more and more.
Because you have in mind the orders we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
For the purpose of God for you is this: that you may be holy, and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh; 
So that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour;
Not in the passion of evil desires, like the Gentiles, who have no knowledge of God;
And that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business: for the Lord is the judge in all these things, as we said to you before and gave witness. 
Because it is God's purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy. 
Whoever, then, goes against this word, goes against not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you. 
But about loving the brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter: for you have the teaching of God that love for one another is right and necessary; 
And, truly, you are lovers of all the brothers in Macedonia; but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more; 
And that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business, working with your hands as we gave you orders; 
That you may be respected by those who are outside, and may have need of nothing. 
But it is our desire, brothers, that you may be certain about those who are sleeping; so that you may have no need for sorrow, as others have who are without hope. 
For if we have faith that Jesus underwent death and came back again, even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by God's power. 
For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are still living at the coming of the Lord, will not go before those who are sleeping. 
Because the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority, with the voice of the chief angel, with the sound of a horn: and the dead in Christ will come to life first; 
Then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the Lord in the air: and so will we be for ever with the Lord. 
So then, give comfort to one another with these words.But about the times and their order, my brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you. 
For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it. 
But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief: 
For you are all sons of light and of the day: we are not of the night or of the dark. 
So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self- controlled and awake. 
For those who are sleeping do so in the night; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night; 
But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation. 
For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who was put to death for us, so that, awake or sleeping, we may have a part in his life. 
So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing. 
But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you; 
And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all. 
Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all. 
Have joy at all times. 
Keep on with your prayers. 
In everything give praise: for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you. 
Do not put out the light of the Spirit; 
Do not make little of the words of the prophets; 
Let all things be tested; keep to what is good; 
Keep from every form of evil. 
And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
God, by whom you have been marked out in his purpose, is unchanging and will make it complete. 
Brothers, keep us in mind in your prayers. 
Give all the brothers a holy kiss. 
I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
It is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you, brothers, because of the great increase of your faith, and the wealth of your love for one another; 
So that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of God for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through; 
Which is a clear sign of the decision which God in his righteousness has made; to give you a part in his kingdom, for which you have undergone this pain; 
For it is an act of righteousness on God's part to give trouble as their reward to those who are troubling you, 
And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with the angels of his power in flames of fire, 
To give punishment to those who have no knowledge of God, and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our Lord Jesus: 
Whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his strength, 
At his coming, when he will have glory in his saints, and will be a cause of wonder in all those who had faith (because our witness among you had effect) in that day. 
For this reason, you are ever in our prayers, that you may seem to our God such as may have a part in his purpose and that by his power he will make all his good purpose, and the work of faith, complete; 
So that glory may be given to the name of our Lord Jesus through you, and you may have glory in him, by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.Now as to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and our meeting with him, it is our desire, my brothers, 
That you may not be moved in mind or troubled by a spirit, or by a word, or by a letter as from us, with the suggestion that the day of the Lord is even now come; 
Give no belief to false words: because there will first be a falling away from the faith, and the revelation of the man of sin, the son of destruction, 
Who puts himself against all authority, lifting himself up over all which is named God or is given worship; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God, putting himself forward as God. 
Have you no memory of what I said when I was with you, giving you word of these things?
And now it is clear to you what is keeping back his revelation till the time comes for him to be seen. 
For the secret of evil is even now at work: but there is one who is keeping back the evil till he is taken out of the way. 
And then will come the revelation of that evil one, whom the Lord Jesus will put to death with the breath of his mouth, and give to destruction by the revelation of his coming; 
Even the one whose coming is marked by the working of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, 
And with every deceit of wrongdoing among those whose fate is destruction; because they were quite without that love of the true faith by which they might have salvation. 
And for this cause, God will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false: 
So that they all may be judged, who had no faith in what is true, but took pleasure in evil. 
But it is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you, brothers, loved by the Lord, because it was the purpose of God from the first that you might have salvation, being made holy by the Spirit and by faith in what is true: 
And in this purpose he gave you a part through the good news of which we were the preachers, even that you might have part in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
So then, brothers, be strong in purpose, and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us. 
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 
Give you comfort and strength in every good work and word.For the rest, my brothers, let there be prayer for us that the word of the Lord may go forward with increasing glory, even as it does with you; 
And that we may be made free from foolish and evil men; for not all have faith. 
But the Lord is true, who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil. 
And we have faith in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders. 
And may your hearts be guided by the Lord into the love of God and quiet waiting for Christ. 
Now we give you orders, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us. 
For you yourselves are used to taking us as your example, because our life among you was ruled by order, 
And we did not take food from any man for nothing, but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you: 
Not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, so that you might do the same. 
For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, If any man does no work, let him not have food. 
For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled, who do no work at all, but are over-interested in the business of others. 
Now to such we give orders and make request in the Lord Jesus, that, working quietly, they get their living. 
And you, my brothers, do not get tired of well-doing. 
And if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter, take note of that man, and keep away from him, so that he may be shamed. 
Have no feeling of hate for him, but take him in hand seriously as a brother. 
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. May the Lord be with you all.
These words of love to you at the end are in my writing, Paul's writing, and this is the mark of every letter from me. 
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
