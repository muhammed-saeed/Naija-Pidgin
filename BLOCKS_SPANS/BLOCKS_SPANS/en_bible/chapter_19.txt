Happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners, or take his place in the way of evil-doers, or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the Lord.
But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and whose mind is on his law day and night.
He will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which gives its fruit at the right time, whose leaves will ever be green; and he will do well in all his undertakings.
The evil-doers are not so; but are like the dust from the grain, which the wind takes away.
For this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged, and the evil- doers will have no place among the upright,
Because the Lord sees the way of the upright, but the end of the sinner is destruction.A Psalm. Of David. When he went in flight from Absalom his son.
Lord, how greatly are they increased who make attacks on me! in great numbers they come against me.
Unnumbered are those who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. (Selah.)
But your strength, O Lord, is round me, you are my glory and the lifter up of my head.
I send up a cry to the Lord with my voice, and he gives me an answer from his holy hill. (Selah.)
I took my rest in sleep, and then again I was awake; for the Lord was my support.
I will have no fear, though ten thousand have come round me, putting themselves against me.
Come to me, Lord; keep me safe, O my God; for you have given all my haters blows on their face-bones; the teeth of the evil-doers have been broken by you.
Salvation comes from the Lord; your blessing is on your people. (Selah.)
