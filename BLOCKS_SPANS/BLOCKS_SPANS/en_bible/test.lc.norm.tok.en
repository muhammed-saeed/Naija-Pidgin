Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the order of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope; 
To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
It was my desire, when I went on into Macedonia, that you mightmakeastopatEphesus, togiveorderstocertainmennottoputforwardadifferent teaching, 
Or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations, from which come questionings and doubts, in place of God's ordered way of life which is in faith; 
But the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart, and a knowledge of what is right, and true faith: 
From which some have been turned away, giving themselves to foolish talking; 
Desiring to be teachers of the law, though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly. 
We are conscious that the law is good, if a man makes a right use of it, 
With the knowledge that the law is made, not for the upright man, but for those who have no respect for law and order, for evil men and sinners, for the unholy and those who have no religion, for those who put their fathers or mothers to death, for takers of life, 
For those who go after loose women, for those with unnatural desires, for those who take men prisoners, who make false statements and false oaths, and those who do any other things against the right teaching, 
Which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great God, which was given into my care. 
I give praise to him who gave me power, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he took me to be true, making me his servant, 
Though I had said violent words against God, and done cruel acts, causing great trouble: but I was given mercy, because I did it without knowledge, not having faith; 
And the grace of our Lord was very great, with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
It is a true saying, in which all may put their faith, that Christ Jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners, of whom I am the chief:
But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the chief of sinners, Jesus Christ might make clear all his mercy, as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life. 
Now to the King eternal, ever-living, unseen, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. So be it. 
This order I give to you, Timothy my son, in harmony with the words of the prophets about you, so that by them you may be strong, fighting the good fight, 
Keeping faith, and being conscious of well-doing; for some, by not doing these things, have gone wrong in relation to the faith: 
Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given up to Satan, so that they may say no more evil words against God.My desire is, first of all, that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men; 
For kings and all those in authority; so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour. 
This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour; 
Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true. 
For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
Who gave himself as an offering for all; witness of which was to be given at the right time; 
And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle (what I say is true, not false,) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith. 
It is my desire, then, that in every place men may give themselves to prayer, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or argument. 
And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price; 
But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God. 
Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority. 
In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
And Adam was not taken by deceit, but the woman, being tricked, became a wrongdoer. 
But if they go on in faith and love and holy self-control, she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth.This is a true saying, A man desiring the position of a Bishop has a desire for a good work. 
The Bishop, then, is to be a man of good name, the husband of one wife, self- controlled, serious-minded, having respect for order, opening his house freely to guests, a ready teacher; 
Not quickly moved to wrath or blows, but gentle; no fighter, no lover of money; 
Ruling his house well, having his children under control with all serious behaviour; 
(For if a man has not the art of ruling his house, how will he take care of the church of God?) 
Not one newly taken into the church, for fear that, through his high opinion of himself, he may come into the same sin as the Evil One. 
And he is to have a good name among those outside the church, so that nothing may be said against him and he may not be taken by the designs of the Evil One. 
Deacons, in the same way, are to be serious in their behaviour, not false in word, not given to taking much wine or greatly desiring the wealth of this world; 
Keeping the secret of the faith in a heart free from sin. 
And let these first be put to the test; then let them become Deacons if there is nothing against them. 
Women are to be serious in behaviour, saying no evil of others, controlling themselves, true in all things. 
Let Deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their houses well. 
For those who have done good work as Deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
I am writing these things to you, though I am hoping to come to you before long; 
But if I am long in coming, this will make clear to you what behaviour is right for men in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of what is true. 
And without argument, great is the secret of religion: He who was seen in the flesh, who was given God's approval in the spirit, was seen by the angels, of whom the good news was given among the nations, in whom the world had faith, who was taken up in glory.But the Spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith, giving their minds to spirits of deceit, and the teachings of evil spirits, 
Through the false ways of men whose words are untrue, whose hearts are burned as with a heated iron; 
Who keep men from being married and from taking food which God made to be taken with praise by those who have faith and true knowledge. 
Because everything which God has made is good, and nothing is evil, if it is taken with praise: 
For it is made holy by the word of God and by prayer. 
If you keep these things before the minds of the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, trained in the words of the faith and of the right teaching which has been your guide: 
But have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories. Give yourself training in religion: 
For the training of the body is of profit for a little, but religion is of profit in every way, giving hope for the life which now is, and for that which is to come. 
This is a true saying, in which all may put their faith.
And this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting, because our hope is in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and specially of those who have faith. 
Let these be your orders and your teaching. 
Let no one make little of you because you are young, but be an example to the church in word, in behaviour, in love, in faith, in holy living. 
Till I come, give attention to the reading of the holy Writings, to comforting the saints, and to teaching. 
Make use of that grace in you, which was given to you by the word of the prophets, when the rulers of the church put their hands on you. 
Have a care for these things; give yourself to them with all your heart, so that all may see how you go forward. 
Give attention to yourself and your teaching. Go on in these things; for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you.Do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church, but let your talk be as to a father, and to the younger men as to brothers: 
To the older women as to mothers, to the younger as to sisters, with a clean heart. 
Give honour to widows who are truly widows. 
Butifanywidowhaschildrenorchildren'schildren, lettheseseethatitisright to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers: for this is pleasing in the eyes of God. 
Now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in God, giving herself to prayer day and night. 
But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she is living. 
Give orders to this effect, so that no evil may be said of anyone. 
If anyone has no care for his family and those in his house, he is false to the faith, and is worse than one who has no faith. 
Let no woman be numbered among the widows who is under sixty years old, and only if she has been the wife of one man, 
And if witness is given of her good works; if she has had the care of children, if she has been kind to travellers, washing the feet of the saints, helping those who are in trouble, giving herself to good works. 
But to the younger widows say No: for when their love is turned away from Christ, they have a desire to be married; 
And they are judged because they have been false to their first faith; 
And they get into the way of doing no work, going about from house to house; and not only doing no work, but talking foolishly, being over-interested in the business of others, saying things which they have no right to say. 
So it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children, controlling their families, and giving the Evil One no chance to say anything against them, 
For even now some are turned away to Satan. 
If any woman of the faith has relations who are widows, let her give them help, so that the care of them does not come on the church, and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed. 
Let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over, specially those whose work is preaching and teaching. 
For the Writings say, It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it. And, The worker has a right to his reward. 
Do not take as true any statement made against one in authority, but only if two or three give witness to it. 
Say sharp words to sinners when all are present, so that the rest may be in fear. 
I give you orders before God and Christ Jesus and the angels of God's selection, to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another. 
Do not put hands on any man without thought, and have no part in other men's sins: keep yourself clean. 
Do not take only water as your drink, but take a little wine for the good of your stomach, and because you are frequently ill. 
The sins of some men are clearly seen, going before them to be judged; but with others, their sins go after them. 
In the same way, there are good works which are clearly seen; and those which are not so, may not be kept secret.Let all who are servants under the yoke give all honour to their masters, so that no evil may be said against the name of God and his teaching. 
And let those whose masters are of the faith have respect for them because they are brothers, working for them the more readily, because those who take part in the good work are of the faith and are dear. Give orders and teaching about these things. 
If any man gives different teaching, not in agreement with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion, 
He has an over-high opinion of himself; being without knowledge, having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words, from which come envy, fighting, cruel words, evil thoughts, 
Bitter talk of men who, being evil in mind and dead to what is true, take the faith to be a way of making profit.
But true faith, with peace of mind, is of great profit:
For we came into the world with nothing, and we are not able to take anything out; 
But if we have food and a roof over us, let that be enough. 
But those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger, and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires, through which men are overtaken by death and destruction. 
For the love of money is a root of all evil: and some whose hearts were fixed on it have been turned away from the faith, and been wounded with unnumbered sorrows. 
But you, O man of God, keep yourself from these things, and go after righteousness, religion, faith, love, a quiet mind, gentle behaviour.
Be fighting the good fight of the faith; take for yourself the life eternal, for which you were marked out, and of which you gave witness in the eyes of all. 
I give you orders before God, the giver of life, and Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate gave witness to the faith, 
To keep the word untouched by evil, clear from all shame, till the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Which at the right time he will make clear, who is the eternal and only Ruler, King of kings, and Lord of lords; 
Who only has life for ever, living in light to which no man may come near; whom no man has seen or is able to see: to whom be honour and power for ever. So be it. 
Give orders to those who have money and goods in this life, not to be lifted up in their minds, or to put their hope in the uncertain chances of wealth, but in God who gives us in full measure all things for our use; 
And to do good, having wealth in good works, being quick to give, taking part with one another;
Making ready for themselves a safe place for the time to come, so that the true life may be theirs. 
O Timothy, take good care of that which is given to you, turning away from the wrong and foolish talk and arguments of that knowledge which is falsely so named;
Through which some, who gave their minds to it, have been turned away from the faith. Grace be with you.Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, in the hope of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 
To Timothy, my well-loved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
I give praise to God, whose servant I have been, with a heart free from sin, from the time of my fathers, because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me, night and day 
Desiring to see you, keeping in my memory your weeping, so that I may be full of joy; 
Having in mind your true faith, which first was in your mother's mother Lois, and in your mother Eunice, and, I am certain, is now in you. 
For this reason I say to you, Let that grace of God which is in you, given to you by my hands, have living power. 
For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of self-control. 
Have no feeling of shame, then, for the witness of our Lord or for me, his prisoner: but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of God; 
Who gave us salvation, marking us out for his purpose, not on account of our works, but in the measure of his purpose and his grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 
But has now been made clear by the revelation of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who put an end to death and made life unending come to light through the good news, 
Of which I was made a preacher and an Apostle and a teacher; 
And for which I undergo these things: but I have no feeling of shame. For I have knowledge of him in whom I have faith, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have given into his care till that day. 
Keep the form of those true words which you had from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
That good thing which was given to you keep safe, through the Holy Spirit which is in us. 
You have had news that all those in Asia went away from me; among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes:
May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help, and had no feeling of shame because I was in chains; 
But when he was in Rome, he went in search of me everywhere, and came to me 
(May he have the Lord's mercy in that day); and of all he did for me at Ephesus you have full knowledge.So then, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
And the things which I have said to you before a number of witnesses, give to those of the faith, so that they may be teachers of others. 
Be ready to do without the comforts of life, as one of the army of Christ Jesus. 
A fighting man, when he is with the army, keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army. 
And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules. 
It is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit. 
Give thought to what I say; for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things. 
Keep in mind Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, who came back from the dead, as my good news gives witness: 
In which I put up with the hardest conditions, even prison chains, like one who has done a crime; but the word of God is not in chains. 
But I undergo all things for the saints, so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
This is a true saying: If we undergo death with him, then will we be living with him:
If we go on to the end, then we will be ruling with him: if we say we have no knowledge of him, then he will say he has no knowledge of us: 
If we are without faith, still he keeps faith, for he will never be untrue to himself. 
Put these things before them, giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words, which is of no profit, only causing error in their hearers. 
Let it be your care to get the approval of God, as a workman who has no cause for shame, giving the true word in the right way.
But take no part in wrong and foolish talk, for those who do so will go farther into evil, 
And their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh: such are Hymenaeus and Philetus; 
Men whose ideas are all false, who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place, overturning the faith of some. 
But God's strong base is unchanging, having this sign, The Lord has knowledge of those who are his: and, Let everyone by whom the name of the Lord is named be turned away from evil. 
Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but others of wood and earth, and some which are honoured and some without honour. 
If a man makes himself clean from these, he will be a vessel for honour, made holy, ready for the master's use, ready for every good work. 
But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young, and go after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart. 
And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings, seeing that they are a cause of trouble. 
For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble, but he is to be gentle to all, ready in teaching, putting up with wrong, 
Gently guiding those who go against the teaching; if by chance God may give them a change of heart and true knowledge, 
And so they may get themselves free from the net of the Evil One, being made the prisoners of the Lord's servant, for the purpose of God.But be certain of this, that in the last days times of trouble will come.
For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, uplifted in pride, given to bitter words, going against the authority of their fathers, never giving praise, having no religion, 
Without natural love, bitter haters, saying evil of others, violent and uncontrolled, hating all good, 
False to their friends, acting without thought, lifted up in mind, loving pleasure more than God; 
Having a form of religion, but turning their backs on the power of it: go not with these. 
For these are they who go secretly into houses, making prisoners of foolish women, weighted down with sin, turned from the way by their evil desires, 
Ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of what is true. 
And as James and Jambres went against Moses, so do these go against what is true: men of evil minds, who, tested by faith, are seen to be false. 
But they will go no farther: for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men, as theirs was in the end. 
But you took as your example my teaching, behaviour, purpose, and faith; my long waiting, my love, my quiet undergoing of trouble; 
My punishments and pain; the things which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; the cruel attacks made on me: and the Lord made me free from them all. 
Yes, and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, will be cruelly attacked. 
Evil and false men will become worse and worse, using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit. 
But see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain, conscious of who has been your teacher; 
And that from the time when you were a child, you have had knowledge of the holy Writings, which are able to make you wise to salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus. 
Every holy Writing which comes from God is of profit for teaching, for training, for guiding, for education in righteousness: 
So that the man of God may be complete, trained and made ready for every good work.I give you orders, before God and Christ Jesus, who will be the judge of the living and the dead, and by his revelation and his kingdom; 
Be preaching the word at all times, in every place; make protests, say sharp words, give comfort, with long waiting and teaching; 
For the time will come when they will not take the true teaching; but, moved by their desires, they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them; 
And shutting their ears to what is true, will be turned away to belief in foolish stories. 
But be self-controlled in all things, do without comfort, go on preaching the good news, completing the work which has been given you to do. 
For I am even now being offered, and my end is near. 
I have made a good fight, I have come to the end of my journey, I have kept the faith: 
From now on, the crown of righteousness is made ready for me, which the Lord, the upright judge, Will give to me at that day: and not only to me, but to all those who have had love for his revelation. 
Do your best to come to me before long: 
For Demas has gone away from me, for love of this present life, and has gone to Thessalonica: Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 
Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and take him with you; for he is of use to me in the work.
Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
The coat which I did not take from Troas and which is with Carpus, get when you come, and the books, specially the papers. 
Alexander the copper-worker did me much wrong: the Lord will give him the reward of his works:
But be on the watch for him, for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching.
At my first meeting with my judges, no one took my part, but all went away from me. May it not be put to their account. 
But the Lord was by my side and gave me strength; so that through me the news might be given out in full measure, and all the Gentiles might give ear: and I was taken out of the mouth of the lion. 
The Lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven: to whom be glory for ever and ever. So be it. 
Give my love to Prisca and Aquila and those of the house of Onesiphorus. 
Erastus was stopping at Corinth; but Trophimus, when I last saw him was at Miletus, ill. 
Do your best to come before the winter. Eubulus sends you his love, and Pudens and Linus and Claudia, and all the brothers. 
The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in agreement with the faith of the saints of God and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion, 
In the hope of eternal life, which was made certain before eternal time, by the word of God who is ever true; 
Who, in his time, made clear his word in the good news, of which, by the order of God our Saviour, I became a preacher; 
To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour. 
I did not take you with me when I went away from Crete, so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there, placing men in authority over the churches in every town, as I said to you; 
Men having a good record, husbands of one wife, whose children are of the faith, children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled. 
For it is necessary for a Bishop to be a man of virtue, as God's servant; not pushing himself forward, not quickly moved to wrath or blows, not desiring profit for himself; 
But opening his house freely to guests; a lover of what is good, serious-minded, upright, holy, self-controlled; 
Keeping to the true word of the teaching, so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters.
For there are men who are not ruled by law; foolish talkers, false teachers, specially those of the circumcision, 
By whom some families have been completely overturned; who take money for teaching things which are not right; these will have to be stopped.
One of their prophets has said, The men of Crete are ever false, evil beasts, lovers of food, hating work. 
This witness is true. So say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith, 
Giving no attention to the fictions of the Jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge. 
To the clean in heart all things are clean: but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean; they become unclean in mind and in thought. 
They say that they have knowledge of God, while by their acts they are turning their backs on him; they are hated by all, hard-hearted, and judged to be without value for any good work.But let your words be in agreement with true and right teaching:
That old men are to be simple in their tastes, serious, wise, true in faith, in love, and of a quiet mind.
That old women are to be self-respecting in behaviour, not saying evil of others, not given to taking much wine, teachers of that which is good, 
Training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children, 
To be wise in mind, clean in heart, kind; working in their houses, living under the authority of their husbands; so that no evil may be said of the word of God. 
To the young men give orders to be wise and serious- minded: 
In all things see that you are an example of good works; holy in your teaching, serious in behaviour, 
Saying true and right words, against which no protest may be made, so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame, unable to say any evil of us. 
Servants are to be under the authority of their masters, pleasing them in all things, without argument; 
Not taking what is not theirs, but giving clear signs of their good faith, in all things doing credit to the teaching of God our Saviour. 
For the grace of God has come, giving salvation to all men, 
Training us so that, turning away from evil and the desires of this world, we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of God in this present life; 
Looking for the glad hope, the revelation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; 
Who gave himself for us, so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing, and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works. 
On all these points give teaching and help, and make clear what is right with all authority. Let all men give you honour.Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities, to do what they are ordered, to be ready for every good work, 
To say no evil of any man, not to be fighters, to give way to others, to be gentle in behaviour to all men.
For in the past we were foolish, hard in heart, turned from the true way, servants of evil desires and pleasures, living in bad feeling and envy, hated and hating one another.
But when the mercy of God our Saviour, and his love to man was seen,
Not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but in the measure of his mercy, he gave us salvation, through the washing of the new birth and the giving of new life in the Holy Spirit, 
Which he gave us freely through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
So that, having been given righteousness through grace, we might have a part in the heritage, the hope of eternal life. 
This is a true saying; and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things, so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works. These things are good and of profit to men; 
But have nothing to do with foolish questionings, and lists of generations, and fights and arguments about the law; for they are of no profit and foolish. 
A man whose opinions are not those of the church, after a first and second protest, is to be kept out of your society; 
Clearly he is in error and a sinner, being self-judged. 
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis: for it is my purpose to be there for the winter. 
Send Zenas, the man of law, and Apollos on their journey with all care, so that they may be in need of nothing. 
And let our people go on with good works for necessary purposes, so that they may not be without fruit. 
All who are with me send you their love. Give our love to our friends in the faith. Grace be with you all.Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith, 
And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,
Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;
That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ. 
For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother. 
And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right, 
Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus: 
My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains, 
Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me: 
Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart: 
Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:
But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart. 
For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever; 
No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord. 
If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself. 
If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account. 
I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life. 
So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ. 
Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.
And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you. 
Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love; 
And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.In times past the word of God came to our fathers through the prophets, in different parts and in different ways; 
But now, at the end of these days, it has come to us through his Son, to whom he has given all things for a heritage, and through whom he made the order of the generations; 
Who, being the outshining of his glory, the true image of his substance, supporting all things by the word of his power, having given himself as an offering making clean from sins, took his seat at the right hand of God in heaven;
Having become by so much better than the angels, as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs. 
To which of the angels did God say at any time, You are my Son, this day I have given you being? or, I will be his Father, and he will be my Son?
And again, when he is sending his only Son into the world, he says, Let all the angels of God give him worship. 
And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire: 
But of the Son he says, Your seat of power, O God, is for ever and ever; and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness. 
You have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil; and so God, your God, has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you. 
You, Lord, at the first did put the earth on its base, and the heavens are the works of your hands: 
They will come to their end; but you are for ever; they will become old as a robe; 
They will be rolled up like a cloth, even like a robe, and they will be changed: but you are the same and your years will have no end. 
But of which of the angels has he said at any time, Take your seat at my right hand till I put all those who are against you under your feet? 
Are they not all helping spirits, who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation?For this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears, for fear that by chance we might be slipping away. 
Because if the word which came through the angels was fixed, and in the past every evil act against God's orders was given its full punishment; 
What will come on us, if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation? a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the Lord, and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came; 
And God was a witness with them, by signs and wonders, and by more than natural powers, and by his distribution of the Holy Spirit at his pleasure. 
For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come, of which I am writing. 
But a certain writer has given his witness, saying, What is man, that you keep him in mind? what is the son of man, that you take him into account? 
You made him a little lower than the angels; you gave him a crown of glory and honour, and made him ruler over all the works of your hands: 
You put all things under his feet. For in making man the ruler over all things, God did not put anything outside his authority; though we do not see everything under him now. 
But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men. 
Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain. 
For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers, 
Saying, I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers, I will make a song of praise to you before the church. 
And again he says, I will put my faith in him. And again, See, I am here, and the children which God has given to me. 
And because the children are flesh and blood, he took a body himself and became like them; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death, that is to say, the Evil One; 
And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death, go free. 
For, truly, he does not take on the life of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham. 
Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people. 
For having been put to the test himself, he is able to give help to others when they are tested.For this reason, holy brothers, marked out to have a part in heaven, give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith; 
Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house. 
And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses, even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house. 
For every house has a builder; but the builder of all things is God. 
And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later; 
But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end. 
And so, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you let his voice come to your ears, 
Be not hard of heart, as when you made me angry, on the day of testing in the waste land, 
When your fathers put me to the test, and saw my works for forty years. 
So that I was angry with this generation, and I said, Their hearts are in error at all times, and they have no knowledge of my ways; 
And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest. 
My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God: 
But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin: 
For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ; 
As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry. 
Who made him angry when his voice came to them? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?
And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land? 
And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders? 
So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief.Let us then, though we still have God's word that we may come into his rest, go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so. 
And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers. 
For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world. 
For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day; 
And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest. 
So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders, 
After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, 
For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day. 
So that there is still a Sabbath- keeping for the people of God. 
For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his. 
Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders.
For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart. 
And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 
Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith. 
For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin. 
Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need.Every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with God, so that he may make offerings for sins. 
He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way, because he himself is feeble; 
And being feeble, he has to make sin-offerings for himself as well as for the people. 
And no man who is not given authority by God, as Aaron was, takes this honour for himself. 
In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest, but was given it by him who said, You are my Son, this day I have given you being: 
As he says in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 
Who in the days of his flesh, having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death, had his prayer answered because of his fear of God. 
And though he was a Son, through the pain which he underwent, the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under God's orders; 
And when he had been made complete, he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders; 
Being named by God a high priest of the order of Melchizedek. 
Of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear, because you are slow of hearing.
And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers, you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of God's revelation; you have become like babies who have need of milk, and not of solid food. 
For everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness: he is a child. 
But solid food is for men of full growth, even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil.For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth; not building again that on which it is based, that is, the turning of the heart from dead works, and faith in God, 
The teaching of baptisms, and of the putting on of hands, and of the future life of the dead, and of the judging on the last day. 
Now we will do this, if God lets us. 
As for those who at one time saw the light, tasting the good things from heaven, and having their part in the Holy Spirit, 
With knowledge of the good word of God, and of the powers of the coming time, 
And then let themselves be turned away, it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time; because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again, openly shaming him. 
For a land, drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked, has a blessing from God: 
But if it sends up thorns and evil plants, it is of no use and is ready to be cursed; its only end is to be burned. 
But, my loved ones, though we say this, we are certain that you have better things in you, things which go with salvation; 
For God is true, and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name, in the help which you gave and still give to the saints. 
And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end: 
So that you may not be slow in heart, but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage, because of their faith and their long waiting. 
For when God made his oath to Abraham, because there was no greater oath, he made it by himself, 
Saying, Be certain that I will give you my blessing, and make your numbers very great. 
And so, when he had been waiting calmly for a long time, God's word to him was put into effect. 
For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater; and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath. 
So that when it was God's desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage, that his purpose was fixed, he made it more certain with an oath; 
So that we, who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us, may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things, in which it is not possible for God to be false; 
And this hope is like a strong band for our souls, fixed and certain, and going in to that which is inside the veil; 
Where Jesus has gone before us, as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, a priest of the Most High God, who gave Abraham his blessing, meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death,
And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had, being first named King of righteousness, and then in addition, King of Salem, that is to say, King of peace;
Being without father or mother, or family, having no birth or end to his life, being made like the Son of God, is a priest for ever. 
Now see how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight. 
And it is true that by the law, those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the people's goods; that is to say, they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham. 
But this man, who was not of their family, took the tenth from Abraham, and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking. 
But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater. 
Now at the present time, men over whom death has power take the tenth; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living. 
And we may say that in Abraham, even Levi, who has a right to take the tenth part, gave it; 
Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him. 
Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi (for the law was given to the people in connection with them), what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron? 
Because if the priests are changed, it is necessary to make a change in the law. 
For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe, of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar. 
Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe.
And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek,
That is to say, not made by a law based on the flesh, but by the power of a life without end: 
For it has been witnessed of him, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 
So the law which went before is put on one side, because it was feeble and without profit. 
(Because the law made nothing complete), and in its place there is a better hope, through which we come near to God. 
And as this is not without the taking of an oath 
(For those were made priests without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him, The Lord gave his oath, which he will not take back, that you are a priest for ever); 
By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus. 
And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests, because death does not let them go on for ever; 
But this priest, because his life goes on for ever, is unchanging. 
So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him, because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them. 
It was right for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy and without evil, doing no wrong, having no part with sinners, and made higher than the heavens: 
Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day, like those high priests, first for himself, and then for the people; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself. 
The law makes high priests of men who are feeble; but the word of the oath, which was made after the law, gives that position to a Son, in whom all good is for ever complete.Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven, 
As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man.
Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering. 
If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law; 
Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain. 
But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things. 
For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second. 
For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; 
Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord. 
For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people: 
And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small. 
And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind. 
When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer.Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order.
For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place. 
And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies; 
Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron's rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement; 
And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail. 
Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings. 
But only the high priest went into the second, once a year, not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people: 
The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open, while the first Tent was still in being; 
And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean, 
Because they are only rules of the flesh, of meats and drinks and washings, which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right. 
But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future, through this greater and better Tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this world, 
And has gone once and for ever into the holy place, having got eternal salvation, not through the blood of goats and young oxen, but through his blood. 
For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the dust from the burning of a young cow, being put on the unclean, make the flesh clean: 
How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God? 
And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage. 
Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it. 
For a testament has effect after death; for what power has it while the man who made it is living? 
So that even the first agreement was not made without blood. 
For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people, he took the blood of goats and young oxen, with water and red wool and hyssop, and put it on the book itself and on all the people, 
Saying, This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you. 
And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way.
And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood, and without blood there is no forgiveness. 
For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these. 
For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men's hands as the copy of the true one; but he went into heaven itself, and now takes his place before the face of God for us. 
And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again, as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his; 
For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself. 
And because by God's law death comes to men once, and after that they are judged; 
So Christ, having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men, will be seen a second time, without sin, by those who are waiting for him, for their salvation.For the law, being only a poor copy of the future good things, and not the true image of those things, is never able to make the people who come to the altar every year with the same offerings completely clean. 
For if this had been possible, would there not have been an end of those offerings, because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins? 
But year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings. 
Because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins. 
So that when he comes into the world, he says, You had no desire for offerings, but you made a body ready for me; 
You had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin. 
Then I said, See, I have come to do your pleasure, O God (as it is said of me in the roll of the book). 
After saying, You had no desire for offerings, for burned offerings or offerings for sin (which are made by the law) and you had no pleasure in them, 
Then he said, See, I have come to do your pleasure. He took away the old order, so that he might put the new order in its place. 
By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever.
And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day, doing what is necessary, and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins. 
But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever, he took his place at the right hand of God; 
And has been waiting there from that time, till all who are against him are made a foot-rest for his feet. 
Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy. 
And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us: for after he had said,
This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, writing them in their minds; he said, 
And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings. 
Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no more offering for sin. 
So then, my brothers, being able to go into the holy place without fear, because of the blood of Jesus, 
By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
And having a great priest over the house of God, 
Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water: 
Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking, for he is true who has given his word: 
And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works; 
Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near. 
For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true, there is no more offering for sins, 
But only a great fear of being judged, and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God. 
A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses: 
But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment? 
For we have had experience of him who says, Punishment is mine, I will give reward. And again, The Lord will be judge of his people. 
We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God. 
But give thought to the days after you had seen the light, when you went through a great war of troubles; 
In part, in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts, before the eyes of everyone, and in part, in being united with those who were attacked in this way. 
For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever. 
So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded. 
For, having done what was right in God's eyes, you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you. 
In a very little time he who is coming will come; he will not be slow. 
But the upright man will be living by his faith; and if he goes back, my soul will have no pleasure in him. 
But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul.Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the sign that the things not seen are true. 
For by it our fathers had God's approval. 
By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be. 
By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead. 
By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death; he was seen no longer, for God took him away: for before he was taken, witness had been given that he was well-pleasing to God: 
And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him, for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is, and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him. 
By faith Noah, being moved by the fear of God, made ready an ark for the salvation of his family, because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time; and through it the world was judged by him, and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith. 
By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage, and went out without knowledge of where he was going. 
By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement, as in a strange land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had a part with him in the same heritage: 
For he was looking for the strong town, whose builder and maker is God. 
And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth, when she was very old, because she had faith in him who gave his word; 
So that from one man, who was near to death, came children in number as the stars in heaven, or as the sand by the seaside, which may not be numbered. 
All these came to their end in faith, not having had the heritage; but having seen it with delight far away, they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth. 
For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves. 
And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out, they would have had chances of turning back. 
But now their desire is for a better country, that is to say, for one in heaven; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God; for he has made ready a town for them. 
By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac, when he was tested: and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body, 
Of whom it had been said, From Isaac will your seed take their name: 
Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead; and because of this he did get him back as if from death. 
By faith Isaac, blessing Jacob and Esau, gave news of things to come.
By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph, when he was near to death; and gave God worship, supported by his stick. 
By faith Joseph, when his end was near, said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt; and gave orders about his bones. 
By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a fair child; and they had no fear of the king's orders. 
By faith Moses, when he became a man, had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God, than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin; 
Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt; for he was looking forward to his reward. 
By faith he went out of Egypt, not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king; for he kept on his way, as seeing him who is unseen. 
By faith he kept the Passover, and put the sign of the blood on the houses, so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death. 
By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land, though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same. 
By faith the walls of Jericho came down, after they had been circled for seven days. 
By faith Rahab, the loose woman, was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders, because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land. 
What more am I to say? For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets: 
Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut, 
Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations. 
Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come; 
And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows, and even with chains and prisons: 
They were stoned, they were cut up with knives, they were tested, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked, 
Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks; for whom the world was not good enough.
And not one of these got the good things of the agreement, though they all had a good record through faith, 
Because God had kept some better thing for us, so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us.For this reason, as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses, putting off every weight, and the sin into which we come so readily, let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us, 
Having our eyes fixed on Jesus, the guide and end of our faith, who went through the pains of the cross, not caring for the shame, because of the joy which was before him, and who has now taken his place at the right hand of God's seat of power. 
Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose. 
Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin: 
And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord's punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him; 
For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod. 
It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father? 
But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part, then you are not true sons, but children of shame. 
And again, if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect, how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits, and have life?
For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is. 
At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness. 
For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong, 
And make straight roads for your feet, so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way, but may be made strong. 
Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord; 
Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it; 
And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food. 
For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed. 
You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind, 
And to the sound of a horn, and the voice of words, the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them: 
For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them; 
And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said, I am shaking and full of fear. 
But you have come to the mountain of Zion, to the place of the living God, to the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and to an army of angels which may not be numbered, 
To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of good men made complete, 
And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man, and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel's blood. 
See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven? 
Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth; but now he has made an oath, saying, There will be still one more shaking, not only of the earth, but of heaven. 
And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible. 
If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect: 
For our God is an all-burning fire.Go on loving your brothers in the faith.
Take care to keep open house: because in this way some have had angels as their guests, without being conscious of it. 
Keep in mind those who are in chains, as if you were chained with them, and those who are in trouble, as being yourselves in the body. 
Let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean; for men untrue in married life will be judged by God. 
Be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have; for he himself has said, I will be with you at all times. 
So that we say with a good heart, The Lord is my helper; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me? 
Keep in mind those who were over you, and who gave you the word of God; seeing the outcome of their way of life, let your faith be like theirs. 
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever. 
Do not be turned away by different strange teachings, because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace, and not by meats, which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them. 
We have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the Tent may not take food. 
For the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents. 
For this reason Jesus was put to death outside the walls, so that he might make the people holy by his blood. 
Let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents, taking his shame on ourselves. 
For here we have no fixed resting-place, but our search is for the one which is to come. 
Let us then make offerings of praise to God at all times through him, that is to say, the fruit of lips giving witness to his name. 
But go on doing good and giving to others, because God is well-pleased with such offerings.
Give ear to those who are rulers over you, and do as they say: for they keep watch over your souls, ready to give an account of them; let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief, because that would be of no profit to you. 
Make prayers for us, for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin, desiring the right way of life in all things. 
I make this request more strongly, in the hope of coming back to you more quickly. 
Now may the God of peace, who made that great keeper of his flock, even our Lord Jesus, come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement, 
Make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires, working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through Jesus Christ; and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever. So be it. 
But, brothers, take kindly the words which I have said for your profit; for I have not sent you a long letter. 
Our brother Timothy has been let out of prison; and if he comes here in a short time, he and I will come to you together. 
Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you, and to all the saints. Those who are in Italy send you their love. 
May grace be with you all.James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth. 
Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when you undergo tests of every sort; 
Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope; 
But let this power have its full effect, so that you may be made complete, needing nothing. 
But if any man among you is without wisdom, let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an unkind word, and it will be given to him. 
Let him make his request in faith, doubting nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea, which are troubled by the driving of the wind. 
Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord; 
For there is a division in his mind, and he is uncertain in all his ways. 
But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up; 
But the man of wealth, that he is made low; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end. 
For when the sun comes up with its burning heat, the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways. 
There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing; because, if he has God's approval, he will be given the crown of life, which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him. 
Let no man say when he is tested, I am tested by God; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil, and he himself puts no man to such a test: 
But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire. 
Then when its time comes, desire gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is of full growth, gives birth to death. 
Do not be turned from the right way, dear brothers. 
Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven, coming from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning. 
Of his purpose he gave us being, by his true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the things which he had made.
You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry; 
For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man. 
For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation. 
But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas. 
Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass; 
For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like. 
But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts. 
If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value. 
The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.My brothers, if you have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, do not take a man's position into account. 
For if a man comes into your Synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring, and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing, 
And you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say, Come here and take this good place; and you say to the poor man, Take up your position there, or be seated at my feet; 
Is there not a division in your minds? have you not become judges with evil thoughts? 
Give ear, my dear brothers; are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by God to have faith as their wealth, and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him? 
But you have put the poor man to shame. Are not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force before their judges? 
Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you? 
But if you keep the greatest law of all, as it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself, you do well: 
But if you take a man's position into account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law. 
For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all. 
For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken. 
Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free. 
For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging. 
What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation? 
If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the day's food, 
And one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warm and full of food; but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need, what profit is there in this? 
Even so faith without works is dead. 
But a man may say, You have faith and I have works; let me see your faith without your works, and I will make my faith clear to you by my works. 
You have the belief that God is one, and you do well: the evil spirits have the same belief, shaking with fear. 
Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith without works is of no use? 
Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works, when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar? 
You see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them; 
And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.
You see that a man's righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only.
And in the same way, was not the righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way? 
For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead.Do not all be teachers, my brothers, because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others. 
For we all go wrong in a number of things. If a man never makes a slip in his talk, then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control. 
Now if we put bits of iron into horses' mouths so that they may be guided by us, we have complete control of their bodies. 
And again ships, though they are so great and are moved by violent winds, are turned by a very small guiding-blade, at the impulse of the man who is using it. 
Even so the tongue is a small part of the body, but it takes credit for great things. How much wood may be lighted by a very little fire! 
And the tongue is a fire; it is the power of evil placed in our bodies, making all the body unclean, putting the wheel of life on fire, and getting its fire from hell. 
For every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority; 
But the tongue may not be controlled by man; it is an unresting evil, it is full of the poison of death. 
With it we give praise to our Lord and Father; and with it we put a curse on men who are made in God's image. 
Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right for these things to be so. 
Does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water? 
Is a fig-tree able to give us olives, my brothers, or do we get figs from a vine, or sweet water from the salt sea?
Who has wisdom and good sense among you? let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom. 
But if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others, have no pride in this, talking falsely against what is true. 
This wisdom is not from heaven, but is of the earth and the flesh and the Evil One. 
For where envy is, and the desire to get the better of others, there is no order, but every sort of evil- doing. 
But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy, then gentle, readily giving way in argument, full of peace and mercy and good works, not doubting, not seeming other than it is. 
And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace.What is the cause of wars and fighting among you? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies? 
You are burning with desire, and have not your desire, so you put men to death; you are full of envy, and you are not able to get your desire, so you are fighting and making war; you have not your desire, because you do not make request for it. 
You make your request but you do not get it, because your request has been wrongly made, desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure. 
O you who are false to God, do you not see that the friends of this world are not God's friends? Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God. 
Or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy Writings say, The spirit which God put into our hearts has a strong desire for us? 
But he gives more grace. So that the Writings say, God is against the men of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him. 
For this cause be ruled by God; but make war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you. 
Come near to God and he will come near to you. Make your hands clean, you evil-doers; put away deceit from your hearts, you false in mind.
Be troubled, with sorrow and weeping; let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief. 
Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him. 
Do not say evil against one another, my brothers. He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brother's judge, says evil against the law and is judging the law: and in judging the law you become, not a doer of the law but a judge. 
There is only one judge and law-giver, even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction; but who are you to be your neighbour's judge? 
How foolish it is to say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this town, and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth:
When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow. What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a little time and then is gone. 
But the right thing to say would be, If it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living, we will do this and that. 
But now you go on glorying in your pride: and all such glorying is evil. 
The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.Come now, you men of wealth, give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you. 
Your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing. 
Your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you, burning into your flesh. You have put by your store in the last days. 
See, the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field, is crying out against you; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies. 
You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure; you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction.
You have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death. He puts up no fight against you. 
Go on waiting calmly, my brothers, till the coming of the Lord, like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come. 
Be as calm in your waiting; let your hearts be strong: because the coming of the Lord is near. 
Say no hard things against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged; see, the judge is waiting at the doors. 
Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble, the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord. 
We say that those men who have gone through pain are happy: you have the story of Job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and mercy in the end. 
But most of all, my brothers, do not take oaths, not by the heaven, or by the earth, or by any other thing: but let your Yes be Yes, and your No be No: so that you may not be judged. 
Is anyone among you in trouble? let him say prayers. Is anyone glad? let him make a song of praise. 
Is anyone among you ill? let him send for the rulers of the church; and let them say prayers over him, putting oil on him in the name of the Lord. 
And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well, and he will be lifted up by the Lord, and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness. 
So then, make a statement of your sins to one another, and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well. The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working. 
Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are, and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain; and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months. 
And he made another prayer, and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit. 
My brothers, if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error, 
Be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way, keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number.Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the saints who are living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
Who, through the purpose of God, have been made holy by the Spirit, disciples of Jesus, made clean by his blood: May you have grace and peace in full measure. 
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
And a heritage fair, holy and for ever new, waiting in heaven for you, 
Who, by the power of God are kept, through faith, for that salvation, which will be seen at the last day. 
You have cause for great joy in this, though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time, being tested in all sorts of ways, 
So that the true metal of your faith, being of much greater value than gold (which, though it comes to an end, is tested by fire), may come to light in praise and glory and honour, at the revelation of Jesus Christ: 
To whom your love is given, though you have not seen him; and the faith which you have in him, though you do not see him now, gives you joy greater than words and full of glory: 
For so you have the true end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. 
For the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you, made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation; 
Attempting to see what sort of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them was pointing to, when it gave witness to the pains which Christ would undergo and the glories which would come after them. 
And it was made clear to those prophets that they were God's servants not for themselves but for you, to give you word of the things which have now come to your ears from the preachers of the good news through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; things which even angels have a desire to see. 
So make your minds ready, and keep on the watch, hoping with all your power for the grace which is to come to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
Like children ruled by God, do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge: 
But be holy in every detail of your lives, as he, whose servants you are, is holy; 
Because it has been said in the Writings, You are to be holy, for I am holy. 
And if you give the name of Father to him who, judging every man by his acts, has no respect for a man's position, then go in fear while you are on this earth: 
Being conscious that you have been made free from that foolish way of life which was your heritage from your fathers, not through a payment of things like silver or gold which come to destruction, 
But through holy blood, like that of a clean and unmarked lamb, even the blood of Christ:
Who was marked out by God before the making of the world, but was caused to be seen in these last times for you, 
Who through him have faith in God who took him up again from the dead into glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God. 
And as you have made your souls clean, being ruled by what is true, and loving one another without deceit, see that your love is warm and from the heart: 
Because you have had a new birth, not from the seed of man, but from eternal seed, through the word of a living and unchanging God. 
For it is said, All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of the grass. The grass becomes dry and the flower dead: 
But the word of the Lord is eternal. And this is the word of the good news which was given to you.So putting away all wrongdoing, and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk,
Be full of desire for the true milk of the word, as babies at their mothers' breasts, so that you may go on to salvation; 
If you have had a taste of the grace of the Lord: 
To whom you come, as to a living stone, not honoured by men, but of great and special value to God; 
You, as living stones, are being made into a house of the spirit, a holy order of priests, making those offerings of the spirit which are pleasing to God through Jesus Christ. 
Because it is said in the Writings, See, I am placing a keystone in Zion, of great and special value; and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame. 
And the value is for you who have faith; but it is said for those without faith, The very stone which the builders put on one side, was made the chief stone of the building; 
And, A stone of falling, a rock of trouble; the word is the cause of their fall, because they go against it, and this was the purpose of God. 
But you are a special people, a holy nation, priests and kings, a people given up completely to God, so that you may make clear the virtues of him who took you out of the dark into the light of heaven. 
In the past you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; then there was no mercy for you, but now mercy has been given to you. 
My loved ones, I make this request with all my heart, that, as those for whom this world is a strange country, you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul; 
Being of good behaviour among the Gentiles; so that though they say now that you are evil-doers, they may see your good works and give glory to God when he comes to be their judge. 
Keep all the laws of men because of the Lord; those of the king, who is over all, 
And those of the rulers who are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and for the praise of those who do well. 
Because it is God's pleasure that foolish and narrow-minded men may be put to shame by your good behaviour: 
As those who are free, not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing, but living as the servants of God; 
Have respect for all, loving the brothers, fearing God, honouring the king. 
Servants, take orders from your masters with all respect; not only if they are good and gentle, but even if they are bad-humoured. 
For it is a sign of grace if a man, desiring to do right in the eyes of God, undergoes pain as punishment for something which he has not done. 
What credit is it if, when you have done evil, you take your punishment quietly? but if you are given punishment for doing right, and take it quietly, this is pleasing to God. 
This is God's purpose for you: because Jesus himself underwent punishment for you, giving you an example, so that you might go in his footsteps: 
Who did no evil, and there was no deceit in his mouth: 
To sharp words he gave no sharp answer; when he was undergoing pain, no angry word came from his lips; but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness: 
He took our sins on himself, giving his body to be nailed on the tree, so that we, being dead to sin, might have a new life in righteousness, and by his wounds we have been made well. 
Because, like sheep, you had gone out of the way; but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls.Wives, be ruled by your husbands; so that even if some of them give no attention to the word, their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives, 
When they see your holy behaviour in the fear of God. 
Do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair, or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing; 
But let them be those of the unseen man of the heart, the ever-shining ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great price in the eyes of God. 
And these were the ornaments of the holy women of the past, whose hope was in God, being ruled by their husbands: 
As Sarah was ruled by Abraham, naming him lord; whose children you are if you do well, and are not put in fear by any danger. 
And you husbands, give thought to your way of life with your wives, giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel, but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life; so that you may not be kept from prayer. 
Last of all, see that you are all in agreement; feeling for one another, loving one another like brothers, full of pity, without pride: 
Not giving back evil for evil, or curse for curse, but in place of cursing, blessing; because this is the purpose of God for you that you may have a heritage of blessing. 
For it is said, Let the man who has a love of life, desiring to see good days, keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit: 
And let him be turned from evil and do good; searching for peace and going after it with all his heart. 
For the eyes of the Lord are on the upright, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. 
Who will do you any damage if you keep your minds fixed on what is good? 
But you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness; have no part in their fear and do not be troubled; 
But give honour to Christ in your hearts as your Lord; and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you, to give an answer in the fear of the Lord and without pride; 
Being conscious that you have done no wrong; so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as Christians may be put to shame. 
Because if it is God's purpose for you to undergo pain, it is better to do so for well-doing than for evil-doing. 
Because Christ once went through pain for sins, the upright one taking the place of sinners, so that through him we might come back to God; being put to death in the flesh, but given life in the Spirit; 
By whom he went to the spirits in prison, preaching to those 
Who, in the days of Noah, went against God's orders; but God in his mercy kept back the punishment, while Noah got ready the ark, in which a small number, that is to say eight persons, got salvation through water:
And baptism, of which this is an image, now gives you salvation, not by washing clean the flesh, but by making you free from the sense of sin before God, through the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead; 
Who has gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule.So that as Jesus was put to death in the flesh, do you yourselves be of the same mind; for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin; 
So that you may give the rest of your lives in the flesh, not to the desires of men, but to the purpose of God. 
Because for long enough, in times past, we have been living after the way of the Gentiles, given up to the desires of the flesh, to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images;
And they are wondering that you no longer go with them in this violent wasting of life, and are saying evil things of you: 
But they will have to give an account of themselves to him who is ready to be the judge of the living and the dead. 
For this was the reason why the good news of Jesus was given even to the dead, so that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but might be living before God in the spirit. 
But the end of all things is near: so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer; 
And most of all be warm in your love for one another; because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number: 
Keep open house for all with a glad heart; 
Making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you, like true servants of the unmeasured grace of God; 
If anyone has anything to say, let it be as the words of God; if anyone has the desire to be the servant of others, let him do it in the strength which is given by God; so that in all things God may have the glory through Jesus Christ, whose are the glory and the power for ever. 
Dear brothers, do not be surprised, as if it was something strange, if your faith is tested as by fire: 
But be glad that you are given a part in the pains of Christ; so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy. 
If men say evil things of you because of the name of Christ, happy are you; for the Spirit of glory and of God is resting on you. 
Let no one among you undergo punishment as a taker of life, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as one who is over-interested in other men's business;
But if he undergoes punishment as a Christian, that is no shame to him; let him give glory to God in this name. 
For the time has come for the judging, starting with the church of God; but if it makes a start with us, what will be the end of those who are not under the rule of God? 
And if it is hard for even the good man to get salvation, what chance has the man without religion or the sinner? 
For this reason let those who by the purpose of God undergo punishment, keep on in well-doing and put their souls into the safe hands of their Maker.I who am myself one of the rulers of the church, and a witness of the death of Christ, having my part in the coming glory, send this serious request to the chief men among you: 
Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care, using your authority, not as forced to do so, but gladly; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind; 
Not as lords over God's heritage, but making yourselves examples to the flock. 
And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep, you will be given the eternal crown of glory.
And in the same way, let the younger men be ruled by the older ones. Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants: for God is a hater of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low. 
For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God, so that when the time comes you may be lifted up;
Putting all your troubles on him, for he takes care of you.
Be serious and keep watch; the Evil One, who is against you, goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food;
Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith, in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles. 
And after you have undergone pain for a little time, the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, will himself give you strength and support, and make you complete in every good thing; 
His is the power for ever. So be it. 
I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus, a true brother, in my opinion; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; keep to it. 
She who is in Babylon, who has a part with you in the purpose of God, sends you her love; and so does my son Mark. 
Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.Simon Peter, a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who with us have a part in the same holy faith in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ: 
May grace and peace ever be increasing in you, in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
Because by his power he has given us everything necessary for life and righteousness, through the knowledge of him who has been our guide by his glory and virtue; 
And through this he has given us the hope of great rewards highly to be valued; so that by them we might have our part in God's being, and be made free from the destruction which is in the world through the desires of the flesh. 
So, for this very cause, take every care; joining virtue to faith, and knowledge to virtue, 
And self-control to knowledge, and a quiet mind to self-control, and fear of God to a quiet mind, 
And love of the brothers to fear of God, and to love of the brothers, love itself. 
For if you have these things in good measure, they will make you fertile and full of fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
For the man who has not these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having no memory of how he was made clean from his old sins. 
For this reason, my brothers, take all the more care to make your selection and approval certain; for if you do these things you will never have a fall: 
For so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
For this reason I will be ready at all times to keep your memory of these things awake, though you have the knowledge of them now and are well based in your present faith. 
And it seems right to me, as long as I am in this tent of flesh, to keep your minds awake by working on your memory; 
For I am conscious that in a short time I will have to put off this tent of flesh, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. 
And I will take every care so that you may have a clear memory of these things after my death. 
For when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, our teaching was not based on stories put together by art, but we were eye-witnesses of his glory. 
For God the Father gave him honour and glory, when such a voice came to him out of the great glory, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased. 
And this voice came from heaven even to our ears, when we were with him on the holy mountain. 
And so the words of the prophets are made more certain; and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place, till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts; 
Being conscious in the first place that no man by himself may give a special sense to the words of the prophets. 
For these words did not ever come through the impulse of men: but the prophets had them from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.But there were false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction, even turning away from the Lord who gave himself for them; whose destruction will come quickly, and they themselves will be the cause of it. 
And a great number will go with them in their evil ways, through whom the true way will have a bad name. 
And in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit, like traders doing business in souls: whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them. 
For if God did not have pity for the angels who did evil, but sent them down into hell, to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged; 
And did not have mercy on the world which then was, but only kept safe Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when he let loose the waters over the world of the evil- doers; 
And sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him; 
And kept safe Lot, the upright man, who was deeply troubled by the unclean life of the evil-doers
(Because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes): 
The Lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing, and to keep evil-doers under punishment till the day of judging; 
But specially those who go after the unclean desires of the flesh, and make sport of authority. Ready to take chances, uncontrolled, they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places:
Though the angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not make use of violent language against them before the Lord. 
But these men, like beasts without reason, whose natural use is to be taken and put to death, crying out against things of which they have no knowledge, will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others; 
For the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil-doing: such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime; they are like the marks of a disease, like poisoned wounds among you, feasting together with you in joy; 
Having eyes full of evil desire, never having enough of sin; turning feeble souls out of the true way; they are children of cursing, whose hearts are well used to bitter envy; 
Turning out of the true way, they have gone wandering in error, after the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing; 
But his wrongdoing was pointed out to him: an ass, talking with a man's voice, put a stop to the error of the prophet. 
These are fountains without water, and mists before a driving storm; for whom the eternal night is kept in store. 
For with high-sounding false words, making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh, they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error; 
Saying that they will be free, while they themselves are the servants of destruction; because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him. 
For if, after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again taken in the net and overcome, their last condition is worse than their first. 
For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness, than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them, after having knowledge of it. 
They are an example of that true saying, The dog has gone back to the food it had put out, and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth.My loved ones, this is now my second letter to you, and in this as in the first, I am attempting to keep your true minds awake; 
So that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past, and the law of the Lord and Saviour which was given to you by his Apostles. 
Having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who, ruled by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things, 
Saying, Where is the hope of his coming? From the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world. 
But in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven, and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water, by the word of God; 
And that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters. 
But the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire, which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men. 
But, my loved ones, keep in mind this one thing, that with the Lord one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years are no more than one day. 
The Lord is not slow in keeping his word, as he seems to some, but he is waiting in mercy for you, not desiring the destruction of any, but that all may be turned from their evil ways. 
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise, and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat, and the world and everything in it will be burned up. 
Seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end, what sort of persons is it right for you to be, in all holy behaviour and righteousness, 
Looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will come to an end through fire, and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat? 
But having faith in his word, we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth, which will be the resting-place of righteousness. 
For this reason, my loved ones, as you are looking for these things, take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him, free from sin and every evil thing. 
And be certain that the long waiting of the Lord is for salvation; even as our brother Paul has said in his letters to you, from the wisdom which was given to him; 
And as he said in all his letters, which had to do with these things; in which are some hard sayings, so that, like the rest of the holy Writings, they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge, to the destruction of their souls. 
For this reason, my loved ones, having knowledge of these things before they take place, take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled, so falling from your true faith. 
But be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. May he have glory now and for ever. So be it.That which was from the first, which has come to our ears, and which we have seen with our eyes, looking on it and touching it with our hands, about the Word of life 
(And the life was made clear to us, and we have seen it and are witnessing to it and giving you word of that eternal life which was with the Father and was seen by us); 
We give you word of all we have seen and everything which has come to our ears, so that you may be united with us; and we are united with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ: 
And we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be made complete. 
This is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you, that God is light and in him there is nothing dark. 
If we say we are joined to him, and are walking still in the dark, our words are false and our acts are untrue: 
But if we are walking in the light, as he is in the light, we are all united with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son makes us clean from all sin. 
If we say that we have no sin, we are false to ourselves and there is nothing true in us. 
If we say openly that we have done wrong, he is upright and true to his word, giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil. 
If we say that we have no sin, we make him false and his word is not in us.My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin. And if any man is a sinner, we have a friend and helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, the upright one: 
He is the offering for our sins; and not for ours only, but for all the world.
And by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him, if we keep his laws.
The man who says, I have knowledge of him, and does not keep his laws, is false, and there is nothing true in him: 
But in every man who keeps his word, the love of God is made complete. By this we may be certain that we are in him: 
He who says that he is living in him, will do as he did. 
My loved ones, I do not give you a new law, but an old law which you had from the first; this old law is the word which came to your ears. 
Again, I give you a new law, which is true in him and in you; for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out. 
He who says that he is in the light, and has hate in his heart for his brother, is still in the dark. 
He who has love for his brother is in the light, and there is no cause of error in him. 
But he who has hate for his brother is in the dark, walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going, unable to see because of the dark. 
I am writing to you, my children, because you have forgiveness of sins through his name. 
I am writing to you, fathers, because you have knowledge of him who was from the first. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil One. I have sent a letter to you, children, because you have knowledge of the Father. 
I have sent a letter to you, fathers, because you have knowledge of him who was from the first. I have sent a letter to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God is in you, and because you have overcome the Evil One. 
Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world. If any man has love for the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
Because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but of the world.
And the world and its desires is coming to an end: but he who does God's pleasure is living for ever. 
Little children, it is the last hour; and as you were given word that the Antichrist would come, so now a number of Antichrists have come to you; and by this we are certain that it is the last hour. 
They went out from us but they were not of us; if they had been of us they would still be with us: but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us. 
And you have the Spirit from the Holy One and you all have knowledge. 
I have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true, but because you have knowledge, and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true. 
Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ? He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son.
He who has no belief in the Son has not the Father: he who makes clear his belief in the Son has the Father. 
But as for you, keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first. If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son. 
And this is the hope which he gave you, even eternal life. 
I am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way. 
As for you, the Spirit which he gave you is still in you, and you have no need of any teacher; but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things, and is true and not false, so keep your hearts in him, through the teaching which he has given you.
And now, my children, keep your hearts in him; so that at his revelation, we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming. 
If you have knowledge that he is upright, it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring.See what great love the Father has given us in naming us the children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not see who we are, because it did not see who he was. 
My loved ones, now we are children of God, and at present it is not clear what we are to be. We are certain that at his revelation we will be like him; for we will see him as he is. 
And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy, even as he is holy. 
Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law, for sin is going against the law. 
And you have knowledge that he came to take away sin: and in him there is no sin.
Anyone who is in him does no sin; anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him. 
My little children, let no man take you out of the true way: he who does righteousness is upright, even as he is upright; 
The sinner is a child of the Evil One; for the Evil One has been a sinner from the first. And the Son of God was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the Evil One. 
Anyone who is a child of God does no sin, because he still has God's seed in him; he is not able to be a sinner, because God is his Father. 
In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One; anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother, is not a child of God. 
Because this is the word which was given to you from the first, that we are to have love for one another; 
Not being of the Evil One like Cain, who put his brother to death. And why did he put him to death? Because his works were evil and his brother's works were good. 
Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world has no love for you. 
We are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers. He who has no love is still in death. 
Anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life, and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him. 
In this we see what love is, because he gave his life for us; and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers. 
But if a man has this world's goods, and sees that his brother is in need, and keeps his heart shut against his brother, how is it possible for the love of God to be in him? 
My little children, do not let our love be in word and in tongue, but let it be in act and in good faith. 
In this way we may be certain that we are true, and may give our heart comfort before him, 
When our heart says that we have done wrong; because God is greater than our heart, and has knowledge of all things. 
My loved ones, if our heart does not say that we have done wrong, we have no fear before him; 
And he gives us all our requests, because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes. 
And this is his law, that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love for one another, even as he said to us. 
He who keeps his laws is in God and God is in him. And the Spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us.My loved ones, do not put your faith in every spirit, but put them to the test, to see if they are from God: because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world. 
By this you may have knowledge of the Spirit of God: every spirit which says that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God: 
And every spirit which does not say this is not from God: this is the spirit of Antichrist, of which you have had word; and it is in the world even now. 
You are of God, my little children, and you have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 
They are of the world, so their talk is the world's talk, and the world gives ear to them. 
We are of God: he who has the knowledge of God gives ear to us; he who is not of God does not give ear to us. By this we may see which is the true spirit, and which is the spirit of error.
My loved ones, let us have love for one another: because love is of God, and everyone who has love is a child of God and has knowledge of God. 
He who has no love has no knowledge of God, because God is love. 
And the love of God was made clear to us when he sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him. 
And this is love, not that we had love for God, but that he had love for us, and sent his Son to be an offering for our sins. 
My loved ones, if God had such love for us, it is right for us to have love for one another. 
No man has ever seen God: if we have love for one another, God is in us and his love is made complete in us: 
And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us. 
And we have seen and give witness that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 
Everyone who says openly that Jesus is the Son of God, has God in him and is in God. 
And we have seen and had faith in the love which God has for us. God is love, and everyone who has love is in God, and God is in him. 
In this way love is made complete in us, so that we may be without fear on the day of judging, because as he is, so are we in this world. 
There is no fear in love: true love has no room for fear, because where fear is, there is pain; and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love. 
We have the power of loving, because he first had love for us. 
If a man says, I have love for God, and has hate for his brother, his words are false: for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen, able to have love for God whom he has not seen? 
And this is the word which we have from him, that he who has love for God is to have the same love for his brother.Everyone who has faith that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God: and everyone who has love for the Father has love for his child. 
In this way, we are certain that we have love for the children of God, when we have love for God and keep his laws. 
For loving God is keeping his laws: and his laws are not hard. 
Anything which comes from God is able to overcome the world: and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith. 
Who is able to overcome the world but the man who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God? 
This is he who came by water and by blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only but by water and by blood. 
And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is true. 
There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood: and all three are in agreement. 
If we take the witness of men to be true, the witness of God is greater: because this is the witness which God has given about his Son. 
He who has faith in the Son of God has the witness in himself: he who has not faith in God makes him false, because he has not faith in the witness which God has given about his Son. 
And his witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
He who has the Son has the life; he who has not the Son of God has not the life. 
I have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the Son of God, so that you may be certain that you have eternal life. 
And we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes, he will give ear to us: 
And if we are certain that he gives ear to all our requests, we are equally certain that we will get our requests. 
If a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death, let him make a prayer to God, and God will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death. There is a sin whose punishment is death: I do not say that he may make such a request then. 
All evil-doing is sin: but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin. 
We are certain that one who is a child of God will do no sin, but the Son of God keeps him so that he is not touched by the Evil One. 
We are certain that we are of God, but all the world is in the power of the Evil One. 
And we are certain that the Son of God has come, and has given us a clear vision, so that we may see him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 
My little children, keep yourselves from false gods.I, a ruler in the church, send word to the noble sister who is of God's selection, and to her children, for whom I have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is true; 
Because of this true knowledge which is in us, and will be with us for ever:
May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love. 
It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father. 
And now, my sister, I make a request to you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first, that we have love for one another. 
And love is the keeping of his laws. This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it. 
Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist. 
Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward. 
Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son. 
If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love: 
For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works. 
Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full. 
The children of your noble sister, who is of God's selection, send you their love.Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James, to those of God's selection who have been made holy by God the Father and are kept safe for Jesus Christ: 
May mercy and peace and love be increased in you.
My loved ones, while my thoughts were full of a letter which I was going to send you about our common salvation, it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever. 
For certain men have come among you secretly, marked out before in the holy Writings for this evil fate, men without the fear of God, turning his grace into an unclean thing, and false to our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. 
Now it is my purpose to put you in mind, though you once had knowledge of all these things, of how the Lord, having taken a people safely out of Egypt, later sent destruction on those who had no faith; 
And the angels who did not keep to their kingdom but went out from the place which was theirs, he has put in eternal chains and in dark night till the great day of the judging. 
Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the towns near them, having like these, given themselves up to unclean desires and gone after strange flesh, have been made an example, undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. 
In the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean, having no respect for authorities, and say evil of rulers. 
Now when Michael, one of the chief angels, was fighting against the Evil One for the body of Moses, fearing to make use of violent words against him, he only said, May the Lord be your judge. 
But these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of; and the things of which they have natural knowledge, like beasts without reason, are the cause of their destruction.
A curse on them! They have gone in the way of Cain, running uncontrolled into the error of Balaam for reward, and have come to destruction by saying evil against the Lord, like Korah. 
These men are unseen rocks at your love-feasts, when they take part in them with you, keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep; clouds without water rushing before the wind, wasted trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots, 
Violent waves of the sea, streaming with their shame, wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever. 
The prophet Enoch, who was the seventh after Adam, said of these men, The Lord came with tens of thousands of his saints, 
To be the judge of all, and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him, because of the evil acts which they have done, and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of God have said against him. 
These are the men who make trouble, ever desiring change, going after evil pleasures, using high- sounding words, respecting men's position in the hope of reward. 
But you, my loved ones, keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
How they said to you, In the last days there will be men who, guided by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things. 
These are the men who make divisions, natural men, not having the Spirit. 
But you, my loved ones, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, and making prayers in the Holy Spirit, 
Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for life eternal through the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
And have pity on those who are in doubt; 
And to some give salvation, pulling them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh. 
Now to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to give you a place in his glory, free from all evil, with great joy, 
To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, let us give glory and honour and authority and power, before all time and now and for ever. So be it.
